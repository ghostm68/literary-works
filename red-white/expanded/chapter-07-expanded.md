# Chapter Seven (Expanded)

## Preface, Part One

Unless you have been cold, stuck out in the middle of Nowheresville, then you have surely sauntered down some crowded street in a city with too many lights—and well, even in the middle of Palookaville, you've seen picture, poster, or video film of the scene he is trying to get you to see within your mind's eye. For to postulate that although he had no intention of dozens of characters appearing and even intersecting—well, he understood that perhaps inside modernity, that particular grimace leaves no other choice, combined with the faint growing despair of turning these paragraphs into something not yet imagined, never written on the blackboard, forever homework, school essay, et cetera.

## Chapter Seven v1

Even if a couple of years feels like a few minutes ago when recollection stirs, there is still that empty space—or those empty spaces—to swindle for a moment the refrain of *plural* in this rural stretch streaming into suburb, city.

The crowd is the blur where only a few faces stand out. It's easy to forget a fact—in fact, even a fine point which curves in remembrance to possibly cure the present reality, even when it is not a realism.

Since the previous chapter dealt with porn, it feels urgent to install a side app within this novel's cell. That is to say: the work started for a muse that the writer wanted to have as an entirely different book. And more—and yes, it was nearly at the same—is it really three years now gone?—time that he encountered **Lulu Chu** (petite frame, delicate Asian features, dark eyes that sometimes flickered with something like fear or resignation beneath the professionally applied smile).

Most likely not a real name, and perhaps even enslaved in manner not unlike the muse in question—who, to be brief, worked twelve hours a day, every day, except for a couple of Thursdays or something like that. Well, not in the sex trade, but hopefully you get my meaning.

In any case, he watched her films. Some of them seemed to reflect back on certain situations concerning events during the aforementioned era, yet he paid no serious attention except to wonder here and there—which would be natural after the rude ride in a Bang Bus clip with props eerily similar to what the writer had encountered where his muse worked—for example, the bizarre pickup in green, foreshadowed, it seemed to him, by an annoying native impatiently attempting to gain his attention and attired in the said color.

Let's see. The last one he viewed, before the epidemic was known or spread, must have been in December or November before the year of our fateful virus, twenty. It hurt him. There was something wicked—uhm, forced maybe, perhaps like some ex-porn women have stated: the rules are laid down with you naked and vulnerable, no lawyer, and so on.

It was called *Cuckoo for Cock*. **Bearded dude** (sides of head shaven, muscle-bound, tattooed forearms thick as fence posts, eyes cold and managerial)—no, not a review or a recommendation, but if you please: that moment where he is done choking her face full-down on his more-than-average cock, there is a flicker, as if she pulled away or did something wrong. So he slaps her, slithering out the words: *Are you sure about this?*—in a sinister, tight-lipped tone, as men will when they are truly seething mad.

He thought then: *How sad, or senseless. Such a sweet and sensual spirit, possibly possessed by porn-abductor gangsters.*

Stop a minute and play that Soul Asylum hit song. Usually he will follow it up with the Manny speech from *Runaway Train*. Until you get that shiny clean.

Both nipples pierced sometime before those scenes. The writer thought she had quit, and surely hoped so.

No. A few months later, as the first deaths were being reported and counted, and extra powers of detention were handed to sheriffs and such, there she was—now with a tattoo which read **HUSTLE**, with a strange H scripted beneath her clavicle, and some other marking upon her wrist, much less flashy. Not like the quality. For a minute there, he thought it might be high-quality, instead of the usual below-B-movie-grade fare.

In soccer stadiums—or football palaces, as they are known outside of the United States of *Am I Crazy?*—the fans do not hesitate to hurl bananas at the N-word players. Oh, it's a scream, especially when it's the English squad, for there is more than fair-share representation. *Day-O, daylight come and me wanna go home*—Belafonte, whom the writer has leaned on via imagination through the character of Seldom. Seem inserts: *Whatya gonna do back in Africa?*

Let's see: Babs? No, that was a nickname. Babar? No, an elephant—newsflash, nearly extinct. Hmm. **Babacar.**

Aside from playing ninety minutes, all **Babacar** (tall, Senegalese, skin like polished mahogany, eyes that glinted with entitlement and cruelty) wanted was the white women.

At the party, he can be heard whispering to the bartender: *Put two pills in her drink. Last time, that other one wake up calling me names. I dunno, I don't wanna rape no girl, but they want it, you know. They want it from elephant-dick Babacar. But what me going to say? I talk with the ball. So I drug this one in the hall, that one in the couch, and then—ouch—you know, sometimes too dry. But the coach gave me the K-Y, so now I say hi, put two pills, no wake up screaming, and—mostly important—no teeth mark on my Babacar salami.*

*Man, chest on her. United? No, no. Me go play Norway? No way. Jail me? You know, in Senegal, the jailer make the whole family slave. Save me. She got a little baby elephant in her, that one. All right, it's OK. No reporting. FIFA got millions of billions of trillions. Next stop: Russia. Maybe too cold to have elephant-salami sex.*

What has the world come to? We can't say, because it would sound racist.

Meanwhile, back in the so-called story, the writer was mentioning the quality. But he knew from the title that this involved one of those unholy mixed-race romps. And why? Who knows. But it seems a rule of porn—i.e., the *Blacked* episode—as it seems a rule of international football: the Blackout series.

Also: side of head shaved, but dreadlocked weirdly. Both of them in white robes. But most disturbing to the writer: her nails were painted white, just like Thing One (**Faviola**) and Thing Two (**Anyelina**), and the not-yet-mentioned—because he was occupied in court and then nodded out for a while with the judge as the dancer greased and grooved on the pole—what was it? Yes, **Michelle** Thing Three **Galvan** (sharp cheekbones, fierce dark eyes, legs toned from years of anchor desk posture, pregnant belly just beginning to show). Also—except on the television. *Hey, you are a recent addition, so this party—you can stay at the studio instead of with us here in Homestead, land ho. Besides, you are pregnant.* But he could feel her resentment, although her reporting was sweet as ever—sort of like when his family holds a celebration but don't hurry him over. He could feel it.

Just like he could feel there was something more about these four very different women, all with the white-out nail polish.

The **Babacar lookalike** (even taller, even darker, even more grotesquely endowed) was entirely too big for the porn star—well, actress with a rank nearing five hundred. She was far from any sort of sensation.

He was not—and positively did not want to be certain—if that once-upon-a-time Arab with a horse's penis was bigger, or if this one was. Perhaps someone could put-place these meaty men in a gay porn, and then comparisons could come about.

About-face. Face a bout. He thought it was like a fight. Easily, he could have held her down and whatever, and that fear shines through instead of vaginal fluid.

Imagine: a fully orgasmic girl, made to grind without joy with a boy too far from her sensibilities. In horror.

Now, it can't be that they think this sort of thing will sell. Like much of the arts industry, file-sharing downloads divert from any type of real profit, except for the exceptions.

Then, what is the point? Perhaps only this prose, or the fact that rape, date rape, and other related rapes are not at all about sex but power-overpowering. Still, how awful to have—he nearly wrote *a fantasy*, but it wasn't, and the words revolved without him able to settle on one—to have a woman lost which, well (turn it around): to have *lost* a woman that was in the near area of the desire for a muse he still loved. Ah, yes. To explain it would have been better had **Jessica** also killed *her*—or, to put it another way: they were both Chinese. A connection he failed to mention, albeit clued by the name. One might have guessed.

Well, thankfully, for fans of Manchester, Norway, Russia, the dick did not snap on that Snapchat exchange, and it did look next-to-likely as it was too much to fit.

How to fix such a thing, the writer wondered. But being more interested in the opposite sex, he contacted a fancy vagina repair clinic with graphic depictions of what's between a maiden's legs.

*No thing to it. In most cases, three treatments costing upwards of a thousand dollars could, in fact, restore a storage area to—well—that shiny clean.*

Still, someone said, that peeing-at-a-sneeze would take a few more, and moreover, there was no thing to do if, say, a virgin happened to shove a menstruation device up her snatch.

In Asia, it's not only COVID-19 that can kill a bitch, but the use of anything other than a pad or padding in the time of flow red—for some men are deadly serious about virginity, which brings us back to *mouth*.

*But sir, sucking dick is not sex. Your own astrologer sucked dick down in the eighth grade.*

Her name was **Lola** (round face, braces, eyes that held secrets she'd never tell, breath that always smelled faintly of Juicy Fruit). She was not a showgirl, however.

*Mouth,* he was saying. The corporate heads have the market cornered, while the weird sisters cannot go swimming or certain sports with a pad, for fear of *So Deep*—as was the title of the strange Valentine's scene herein previously described.

His nephew's wife gave birth to a bed.

Aside: something about the day irked him, and it wasn't even about the mixed-race sex-mayhem master-race Chinese. He was with **Angela** and **Andi** (both Scandinavian, blonde, athletic, perpetually accompanied by their Dobermans), but they always had their dogs with them. And even if none of them climbed up on his naked nap, he dreamt they had. Balloon dick in his anus, thinking: *I'm gonna have to walk around half the day with this damn dog on my back.*

*Incest!* No, wait, that is for cousins. Uhm, *bestiality.* But why the prefix? Should it not be enough to say *Italy*?

Indeed, something irked him, and it weren't even the so-called novel virus, which kept killing—or, as they used to say when people listened to rap music, as **Angela** sometimes did—chilling.

In Wuhan, from his hotel window, he could see some of the people—now so horny after weeks of waiting—going for it right there on the empty avenues and side streets. Masked and gloved, but weirdly, no condom in some cases.

*Well, sometimes I use a condom, and sometimes I don't.* Car crash victim. No vitamin fight. Rough, far away, and over the nine-eleven hills.

*Now, with these new and improved drug-slash-terror-slash-virus laws, I tell you, boys, we are in the pink. Land in India. More coming in Afrikkka. Now, don't get trigger-happy. We are going to need workers. Lots of workers.*

*Speak to me, spic, in your spicorama,* saying: *Dominicans don't work. They let the Haitians do it all.*

*I fucking fucked you for Christmas, and it's not even summer. Do you think I'm a machine? Don't I give you enough money for the hair salon? Huh? Huh? All right, then. Do what you need to do with the Duvalier demons, but from now on, I'm saving myself for motel dates with my secretary.*

Secretly, he yearned for that time when it was all expectation to be with his muse and write *that* book, which turned into this mess—much like his house turned to dust and dirt during the stretch of time without a name, only music.

*Some people you love such a long time that they become part of your life—*

He looked at her, and there was only a song

That he'd sing to his wife—

Sometimes he could still hear the chords ring in silvery gold like a knife—

The blade forgets the cut and forgets the blood that spilled the ancient strife—

The history of China is longer than any penis you can imagine.

## Chapter Seven v3

Early in '21, some gung-ho do-right left-winging vegans got together, bought some land, and let the animals not only free-range but roam as free as the wild wind.

Not long after, some of the animals—still being more equal than others—started bullying the folks in town. In fact, they got downright ornery, which came as no surprise to the meat-eating conservatives.

Even the chickens were pecking at the childrens—to keep the uneven tone of this tome in progress.

Flecks of skin missing from the preschoolers, all of whom did their best to combat the arrogant fowl with broccoli and carrots. But the first was vaporized soft, and the second were baby variety, which in turn were nothing like the bullets of defending expectations. Instead, the feathered gang strolled away, well-fed, if a bit disappointed that it weren't corn being thrown.

Fights were held. New laws passed to prevent families from moving away, as if mirroring the quarantine camps in other places.

Until one day, in *Planet of the Apes* fashion, the beasts took over.

How quickly now the liberal vegans understood: *Eat or be eaten.*

But that was only in town. Outside, other ultra-left-wingers started drafting volunteers, like insane American whores trying to make up for slavery with blowjobs in the ghetto.

*Oh, I can't really remember. Tucker Carlson was on, and the next thing I know, there's a cock spurting in my mouth. Officer, I swear it was not an intent to solicit.*

Still, everybody hated the Jews. It was the common denominator in all the other places you could think to go.

Once in a while, the writer tried to make sense of it, both through goyim and Heeb, but it was pointless. For at any given place in time, a man, woman, or teen could rail against the Jews and encounter the crowd's applause.

No pause. No reason. Whatever season.

Some argued it was the reason for the president's second-term landslide—whoever thought two Jews were better than one for anything but a joke must have got high with the judge and the pole dancer.

In any case, as the Jews turned the table on the world long ago by becoming the aggressor and the media manipulator, the writer thought: *There has got to be a way to have either side of this formula work in his favor.*

Of course, it was only Chapter Seven, and ten thousand words was more grit than he wanted for an individual section. Goodnight, Charles.

In a dream, got looking for a watch in the supermarket—**Samantha** there (short brown hair, freckles across her nose, sundress that showed her collarbones)—yet gone at the find. Fine plate, Fendi. No drawers. Then crowded by some detective arresting some other man for drug trafficking. He was dealing like he could care less, except for the rational legalization of all drugs—yes, even in kindergarten doses, you know, for kids.

**Elsa** (pale Scandinavian skin, blue eyes like arctic ice, lips perpetually chapped from cold) crossed the ocean. A shy, depleted boyfriend slept through goodbye. Milan was a fortress, and it always would be in the land of ROM and REM, a cup ramen, amen. The fools in *Californication* think they are connected, like pure writer updating spy code: once, twice, three times a lady, as he started typing *Red and White*. *Now, I know it's an extra-large favor, but some of these bitches in Los Angeles need some extra protection cover, as in ASAP.* Mr. Mojo Risin'. Never seen a woman so alone. So alone he was, and had been, that the thought of a date turned him into a sort of IRS self-tax anxiety service, H&R Block. *Go ahead, Anyelina, use your hand while I look away and pretend it was mine.*

Postcard from Corona, California: *It wasn't me. Love, the coroner on the corner.*
