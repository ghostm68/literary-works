_________________________________________
   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br>

friday. leaving the
left over steak, i
almond cupcake 
thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...
i view sin takes
a holiday, there
is talk of putin
possibly accepting
a cease fire...
they call him
ironically a war
lord...i dont 
understand the
word unironically.
worse:

at jpg or
"FullsizeMugshotHandle"	
super size obituaries 
i log into x formerly 
twitter...
flirt with the idea
of a caleb carr post,
son of lucien said
the beatniks were
not child friendly
and they weren't 
i read alienest and
thought it was all right.
like an overnight stay
in jail. 
penobscot bay pilot
like an answer in
riddle, carolyn

i months late
laundry...
someone force me to
write emails and
do laundry...
i dont nkow
waht she meant,
but it is none of
my business...
i simply wait for
her even when she
is right in the middle
of my thoughts...
miss grant goes to the door,
<img width="66" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostm68/pantheon/main/MGGTTD_240525_134909.gif">	
eight minutes 1940s...
i close-up her hand
on screen place mine
atop and somehow do not
feel weird over it...
these wires love infused
with chaotic emotions i cut,
hang wet sheets randomly
the cat has trout and
then chicken but is ready
for more...
like me with cigarettes...
coffee... 
	sixteen minutes
to five.	</p>	
   
  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> saturday </p>

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
(not the windmills, poetry book title
i thought of while cervantes)
add bread and onion
to left over steak which is somehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends

  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> sunday </p>

    <p class="feature-intro">awake at five
still dark with dreams of lost homes -
living room italia fifteen
a cousin holds me from the back...	
in a an embrace as i try to reach
the balcony - mother is there
and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against
word play poetry, and then
i will have something
wirth reading even if it caint
be translated told.

with snapdragon interruption
key press not typing restart)

<p class="feature-intro start">>>> monday </p>

		<p class="feature-intro">narcissistic
myself passenger pull down glance-
on looking what reflection fascinating
love...	struggle to dream - two, three,
roger emil crubel at the piper funeral
home, dorothy we are not in kansas -
amanda paints with her puppy -
los angeles london ashley leak
finger in her mouth, i suppose
she would not be surprised...
it's the nature of such acts -
i am surprised to see her in
my dreams as if a tug of war
with grant...emilee again at
bar louie as the rangers
and panthers play overhead -
pink in her nails now 
fav photo of us forever
i imagine myself, i awake to it
feeling only minutes have gone by -
unlike the hours to update 99
and create inkrealm.info/dr -
they both remind me of her -
visiting the hive, how you
behave is how you behave...
chinese fortune cookie
behind a polaroid on her phone -
blurred, i burn as if born
to mourn the distance -
my own distrust dance
how is it still lust?
suddenly it isnt - it ain't
anything except acceptance -
district twenty five...
her friends are pretty -
my prose isnt poetry and
i can't keep track of the
narrative now as the wires
reattach and embrace me
electrified i die and
reanimate myself - salvation
saliva sylvia has done it again
nazi lampshade press lights
but if it were your women
you'd kill every man woman
or teen in town...at the lampshop
the label is numbered two 
nine five - curiosity rises
hungry to eat men like air -
so now my wife even if
not in my life, so now i sense
the extent of my promise...
beyond this ignorant present,
and I feel now
The future in the instant...
i might even understand the
why within i love you still
but you really made me hate you...
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all...			
she runs away and yet remains.
i escape the tug of catfight
war waking too early, i breathe
for three hours mostly her
magic and exhale these meetings
la matadora with seven brew
fizz or sin a moan spice 
red straw blue tipped nails -
adorn the pink...
oh what is that zepellin...think,
At last the arm is straight, 
the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

like t'ee in the way
tuesday
nell tiger free
i start watching for bill
but sonia is there too -
the first oh man i cannnot
concentrate, it's a poetic
canvas, but i'm pulled
by love - i can hear her
even high in soft spoken
whisper, would you leave
that movie for me -
i'll stop the world 
and melt with you -
i skip through it
in a few minutes...
of course, she's not
there anyway and i start
thinking what exactly
do i have to be proud
about - the hit the books
so they don't hit you back
gimmick, the sleeping pills
in attack dog snack gimmick,
the pile of dead bodies in
vampire mansion gimmick...
all right mister inky,
write manipulated association- 
concentrate back by dream...
i kept seeing the girl she
called baby munchkin cake -
as if trying to create 
only connection machine -
i couldnt understand
i cant understand
i curve into a rising
as if cut in two
one side emilee
the other leah -
newspaper sentiments
what the fuck is star wars about
planet alderaan the rebel alliance
leia was in love with han solo...
so there are days when she requires
all my love, literally -
friends romans countrymen lend
me your apathy i come not to party
but to burn down distractions -
don't think i have no pride,
i still didn't make no pasta...
reckless cleaning room and
kitchen her news reminds
me of the cuts my finger knife
sixteen july birkin
who killed jane not the squad
kid i think we been framed -
to miss someone you never
truly knew - "we blew it"
(- do we ever know anyone?
we only know them under
certain circumstances...)
 easy rider ending -
mind zooms dennis hoppper
as apocalypse now photographer...
anglophone crisis
last year sunday
lobster phone dali
oleg also got knifed
alaska earthquake
and forty two 
dead pilot whales...
dear leah it's not
that i ran away, what's
the frequency kenneth, it's
that i haven't figured out
out how to be platonic
without making imagined
emilee homicidal -
at least lara only
threatened to cut off
my penis, but the death 
penalty...where was i
ah yes typing with my
pickers and stealers -
same with family in 
mind, then how is it 
not incest - tabanidae
lands on right hand -
i had the sudden idea;
go set jury
an officer and a gentleman...
dead at eighty seven...
barry and stone vermont
fred fishback karen our canary
only two song references here
let us make it three
one for tomorrow one just for today
i scroll tik tok
but i'm only thinking of her
and maybe william f buckley jr.
critical theory makes me blink
alivia with heart drawn on her wrist
very much like the one emilee
drew next to her thumb 
four a siamese cat of a girl
previous lyric had it
as squirming dog -
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs: 
ain't got that memorized yet...
promise me you'll never leave,
alivia utters, in terms of emilee -
never divorce...so no pre-nup
hey hey my my...i guess if you
pay off your little sister with
the tie-dye tee as well as the 
put a finger down flower print,
you get an enforcer, tyne daly
hello my name is doris, i listen
to hotel california with an entirely
new twist...i look at her picture
with a "neat" label more than
once, more than twice, barbie
does not sing fais dodo...five
i never know what the poor girl's
gonna do to me next...
hate to tell you this, buddy,
but you have to wear clothes 
to work, there's a law or something
perth to melbourne virgin flight
naked lunch emergency landing
not stepping foot in -
tube feet -
if you look carefully at my lips
you'll realize i'm actually saying something
else...
wta tits beguile me as i worry
she knows i have looked at leah's
breasts more than once, more than twice -
sinner confirms kalinskaya
of course i've never actually
been this faithful down the line
