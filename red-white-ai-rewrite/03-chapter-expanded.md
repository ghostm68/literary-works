# Chapter Three: The Cage of Age

*An AI-expanded version preserving the original voice while adding psychological depth*

---

He tried to gently pace back and forth within the confines of his cage, of his age... The metaphor wasn't lost on him—this deliberate ambiguity that had become his trademark, this way of letting words slip into double meanings like water finding cracks in stone. The cage was literal: four walls, a desk, a chair, the manuscript pages scattered like fallen leaves. But the age—ah, the age was something else entirely. Thirty-seven years of accumulated disappointments, of near-misses and almosts, of watching other writers achieve what he could only dream of in his most generous moments.

An irritation surfaced upon his skin... Water, cream... The mundane remedies of a body that betrayed him daily, that insisted on its physical needs when all he wanted was to transcend, to exist purely as mind, as creative force. Of course what actually irritated him was the lack of direction, perhaps inspiration... the narrowing limits of creativity which nearly held him back from typing at all...

The cursor blinked. Mocking. Insistent. Like a heartbeat that refused to stop, even when the body housing it had given up on living in any meaningful sense. He understood now why Hemingway had called the blank page his enemy. But Hemingway had been drunk most of the time, and he—he was sober now, some weeks, crystal clear and therefore capable of seeing exactly how far he had to fall.

It had started some home hours before... The phrase felt wrong even as he typed it, this collision of 'some' and 'home' that his fingers had produced without consulting his brain. Were these Freudian slips becoming more frequent? Notes, are they too casual, too hateful, too obscene... One does need to make a dollar or a couple of million...

The economics of art. The prostitution of the sacred. He'd read somewhere—was it Bukowski? Miller?—that every writer eventually faces this moment: the choice between integrity and survival, between saying what needs to be said and saying what will sell. The market didn't want truth; it wanted comfort. It wanted confirmation of what people already believed, wrapped in enough sophistication to make them feel intelligent for consuming it.

Notes, make that pounds, the sterling at two against the euro...

Even his currency was confused, displaced, belonging nowhere. Like him. American by birth, European by aspiration, homeless by circumstance. The exchange rates mattered because poverty was international, because rejection letters arrived in multiple languages but always said the same thing: *not quite*, *not now*, *not you*.

This was a love story, but the orgy of images must have its way and win, it seems...

And there it was—the central conflict that had been eating at him for months. He'd started with such pure intentions: a simple love story, boy meets girl, complications ensue, resolution achieved. But his mind, trained by decades of consuming everything from Kerouac to Pynchon, couldn't help but complicate, couldn't help but see connections where others saw only sequence. The images came unbidden, sexual and violent and strange, demanding inclusion in what should have been tender.

Seas tranquil, the thought of real masters and their quill...

The masters. Always the masters, hovering over his shoulder like disappointed fathers. What would Joyce do with this sentence? How would Faulkner handle this transition? The anxiety of influence, Bloom had called it, though Bloom himself had become another influence to be anxious about. The tradition was both lifeline and anchor, keeping him afloat and drowning him simultaneously.

Where he'd grown up it was more like nyquill...

The wordplay came automatically now, muscle memory of a mind trained to see double meanings everywhere. NyQuil, the medicine that promised rest but delivered only artificial stupor. Like his childhood, like his adolescence, like most of his twenties—medicated into numbness, self-administered and socially sanctioned.

He had escaped the life of an alcoholic a few times but that was only because he disliked the aftermath sort of like you can have money but then taxes...

The comparison was apt, depressingly so. Everything good came with consequences, everything pleasurable demanded payment. The bottle had offered escape, but at the cost of clarity. Sobriety offered clarity, but at the cost of comfort. There was no winning, only different ways of losing.

Sober now, some weeks, he pondered straight as a holy spirit filled preacher...

The religious imagery surprised him. He'd been an atheist since sixteen, confirmed in his disbelief by years of studying the hypocrisies of organized faith. But sobriety did feel like a kind of conversion, a daily choice to believe in the possibility of redemption despite all evidence to the contrary. The preacher's straightness—both moral and pharmaceutical—became his aspiration.

Notes, too easy to take out of context... too easy to mix up homage with word theft...

The paranoia was justified. In an age of digital everything, every phrase could be googled, every turn of phrase checked against the vast database of human expression. Originality had become increasingly elusive, or perhaps it had always been a myth, and only now did the technology exist to prove it. Was he influenced by or stealing from the voices in his head?

Word dust, you can't take words with you into space... and yet, he always felt better about his writing when he did not neglect what was in front of him...

The cosmic perspective versus the immediate one. Words as dust—meaningless in the vast scheme of things, unlikely to survive the heat death of the universe. But also words as the only thing that mattered, the only way to make sense of the inexplicable fact of existence. The contradiction didn't resolve; it simply had to be lived with.

The sweet manner in which the cashier treated him earlier that day...

And here was salvation, arriving disguised as ordinary human kindness. The cashier—barely twenty, he'd guess, with tired eyes but a genuine smile—had treated him not as the failure he felt himself to be, but as a person worthy of basic courtesy. Such a small thing, but in his current state, it felt revolutionary.

It was the love that usually only mothers put on the job for their sons...

Unconditional, uncomplicated, asking nothing in return. He'd lost his mother three years ago, and only now was beginning to understand what had died with her: the one person in the world who had believed in his potential without requiring proof, who had loved him not for his achievements but for his existence.

The way their hands brushed, casual as leaves falling silently to the hard ground..

The moment stretched, became poetry. Two strangers touching accidentally, skin on skin for perhaps a second, but carrying the weight of all human connection. He'd write about it, he knew, would transform this mundane exchange into something larger, because that's what writers did—they took the ordinary and made it sacred, took the meaningless and made it mean.

Hair messy didn't get dressy...

Another slip, another collision of intended and actual. His appearance had deteriorated with his circumstances. The careful grooming of his more prosperous days had given way to the practical neglect of someone focused on survival. But perhaps there was honesty in this dishevelment, a rejection of the masks that society demanded.

What he has learned is that really you need to kill your sweethearts, no pun intended, joan.

The literary advice made flesh. Darlings must die, whether they be favorite phrases or beloved characters or—and here was the real terror—beloved people. Joan. The name arrived without explanation, carrying weight he couldn't immediately identify. Someone lost, someone mourned, someone whose death had taught him the hardest lesson of all: that love makes you vulnerable in ways that can destroy you.

Miro mira mirror mirror on the outlaw they love the guns blazing bad guy...

The fairy tale corrupted, made contemporary. The mirror now reflected not the fairest of them all but the most dangerous, the most violent, the most marketable. Society's appetite for destruction dressed up as entertainment. He was implicated in this too—how many of his own stories featured violence as a shortcut to meaning?

And the triple x fact that sex sells, notice young ones, it also swells... ahem.

The crude pun barely concealed a deeper frustration. Sex as commodity, desire as marketing strategy. But also sex as life force, as the thing that made all the suffering worthwhile. The swelling—of passion, of hope, of possibility—that came with genuine human connection. The ellipsis and the cough suggested embarrassment at his own crudeness, but also defiance: why should he be ashamed of acknowledging what everyone knew but few admitted?

Now then, he can't bring himself to end the loved one, the beloved no not even in fiction and so it is like fighting with one hand tied behind his back -

The writerly confession: he lacked the killer instinct that great art demanded. His tenderness, his empathy, his fundamental decency—all the qualities that made him human also made him weak as an artist. The beloved had to die for the story to live, but he couldn't wield the knife, couldn't commit the necessary murder.

Reality sandwiches is that a noun or verb, the holy homosexual jerking off into a handkerchief reminds him first thought best thought...

Ginsberg's influence, unmistakable and unashamed. The Beat philosophy of immediate expression, of trusting the first impulse, of allowing the subconscious to dictate. But was it wisdom or justification for laziness? The holy homosexual—Ginsberg himself—had preached spontaneous composition, but he'd also revised obsessively. The mythology of effortless creation was exactly that: mythology.

It was nearly always true except now there one too many puppet masters and so chaos exceeds logic in a few cases...

The modern condition: too many influences, too many voices, too much information. The puppet masters were the market forces, the editors, the critics, the social media algorithms that determined who got read and who got ignored. In such a system, logic became irrelevant. Only chaos could capture the truth of contemporary existence.

How long does one make a literary apology, he wonders...

The self-consciousness was paralyzing. Every word required justification, every choice demanded explanation. He was apologizing for his influences, for his failures, for his very existence on the page. But wasn't this humility also a kind of strength? The willingness to acknowledge limitation, to admit uncertainty?

Brief soul brevity the thing is he is only a student of those that came before and left these pages for him to fill...

The admission was both humble and grandiose. A student, yes, but also an heir to the entire tradition of human expression. The pages left for him to fill—blank by necessity, but also pregnant with possibility. Every writer stood on the shoulders of giants, but that height also provided a better view.

Still, he knows that story is paramount and although only trying to fight his way into a new working draft to reach the finish line - he cannot skip the numbers as they are announced in the winning sweepstakes of red white as it were...

The gambling metaphor revealed everything: writing as lottery, success as chance, talent as insufficient guarantee. The numbers being announced—page numbers, word counts, the arbitrary metrics by which progress was measured. The finish line existed, but it kept moving, kept receding into the distance.

For a second, as he fends off the doomsday down with your own thought and into pre-recorded punishments, he weighs making a sort of promise to let the story seethe into the forthcoming chapters but that would be dishonest especially after the koala hyphen kangaroo apocalypse down under...

The descent into stream-of-consciousness, thought fragmenting under pressure. Doomsday as both external threat and internal collapse. The koala-kangaroo apocalypse—Australia burning, perhaps, or just his mind making connections that defied logic but felt emotionally true. Dishonesty as the greatest sin a writer could commit, even when honesty revealed madness.

For another second his mind races back to his personal journal of november and december in that year which now seems a lifetime ago...

Time compressed and expanded simultaneously. Recent months feeling like decades, decades feeling like moments. The journal as repository of the authentic self, the place where truth lived unfiltered by artistic consideration or commercial concern.
