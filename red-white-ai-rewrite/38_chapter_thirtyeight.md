# Chapter 38: Chapter Thirty-Eight

## Syrian Electric Workers and Missing Chapters

Women in tight pants climbing a pole.

Notes at 38 yet he counts 42 chapters. Note: **34 and 35 were not**...skipped from 33 to 36, reason not in memo or memory.

Mind...find in drama dream the witch's bed, his own it seemz perhaps larger, all white...the dog all black speaks as if a hoodlum, the thug jealous...she spills him on herself—he awakez still in the dream to feel the wetness then again to find himself in his usual space...the ejaculation maybe her wink of control.

*If you think Marie was love, ha...*

Music magazine 1960s Asian greyscale grainy women—he looks through knowing these too have been corrupted by mix-up. Nothing he can do.

Call away, Mr. Pickles did not pull no punch. He agreex it was a mafia of the worst sort.

The road to hell in good intentions—Texas girl tries to save a squirrel, it jumps on her face, everyone giggles except him seeing the paradox.

Socks and sex strangers attempting the rainbow coalition edition—he cannot read that book.

*Note: keep the slavery proposition on the back burner...for now.*

*Our day will come, we will over Columbia, you fool.*

**Barnard**...

## Holland, Lily, Eeline, and Replicas

And back to **Holland**—holla back strange pants. First encounterex with **Lily**, last seen playing Nazi against Jewish bagels—maybe she finally agrees all this too greasy.

**IA the VG** introduces him to **Eeline**, a replica, and he does his best to distinguish between them but it is obvious they could have him at their mercy.

He decides to double-check the situation but it is only worse in definition. Obviously if one girl can turn into two, imagine what a group could accomplish.

*Your agenda is booked solid for the next five years.*

Well, it worked too well...right away, the blemish now beaming skin healthy.

He rails, *I'm not the cream that is Clapton and his ship is going down any day now, get me outta this...*

**Lawyers guns money**...

It was nearing eight of morning, everything seemed so far away, distant.

Ms. Goo Avower exploring London as if no virus outbreak had exploded—he worried, things were going back to backwards.

## Cancel Culture: GWTW, Godfather, Pulp Fiction, and Gandhi

*Gone with the Wind* gone for racism. He counted—this might never stop. From *Godfather*: *They are animals anyway* to *Pulp Fiction*: *Dead nigger storage*.

**Gandhi** of course was immune. The Hindus had sacrificed many women in order to keep his good name from being slaughtered.

Roundtree, Thursday, the Grovesnor. It would be like calling Ben "Bugsy" at a meeting. Never happened.

What is that happening city? No, no, not that one—it was actually **Syria**...they said women in tight pants climbing poles...as in college girls, interracial porn—well, not so much.

*Never have I ever—*

**Electric company workers** from the shortages caused by conflict nobody cares about because only one thing can matter, mister.

Meanwhile the **extremist elite** are preparing the kids: *Fuck your mother in the ass, turn her around and put it in her mouth until Allah is pleased, now cut off the arm of your little brother and stack it with the other amputations.*

New age politically correct vegan love and equality livestream won't stand a cricket's chance in a room full of lizards. Not that suicide bombers ever leave much room for chirping.

## Feral Kitten and Garden Snake

The feral kitten appeared hypnotized by a garden snake which slithered across the crossroads in the dark of evening and danced above it, pawing and pretending nothing else in the world existed. Both of them out of place, distracted and confused, making each other reenact the sequence in a faux déjà vu turnaround which he glanced at from his balcony in the dead of night.

*Paragraph out of place*

## *Naked Lunch* Origin and Kerouac Myth

So, **Kerouac did not coin the title**. Ginsberg simply read from "queer naked lust" as *Naked Lunch* and Jack corrected, but William Burroughs and much of literary history attribute it to the *On the Road* scribe.

He could not sleep as the downstairs open the doors every time he steps out, tangled the fabric of reality.

The maid note, saludo update—Anita or such, they say she cannot walk or talk, thus a man comes to move the large thing, but they have said so many things including vertigo and Alzheimer's that he is reluctant to believe them.

Up to the door and loud mousey talk. How could it be?

The witch finds a feral cat and flaunts her sexuality with **King Leopold** no less. *Well, you had it coming, fourteen—she's fourteen.*

Who knew? **IA the VG** grins: *Now I got him where I want him.*

Finally asleep, no dream—as if the encounter with **Alicia** haunted him. Nudity and desperation, another cashier from another place—aha, a mother place.

## Racism Manifesto and Population Control

Bottles of what water sister—he never dreams of her unless he is not himself. Awake, two in the morning.

Lauren had reminded him of some hack or perhaps she was pointing out too many characters. Daniella imposing Emma. Earthy pancakes—there was something about that picture.

Read back 36, half an hour. It didn't weigh as much as he feared even if below average. *What is this book...a look...these glances yet to be edited.*

The *Lunch* took years and many turns—not that he is aiming for similarity—as example of manuscript and manuscript preparation. Olympia edition "The" and then Grove Press addition standard until the restored text.

Strange feeling to have spent so much time right where they all walked and breathed. Upper West Side—he wanted to underline that the anti-blonde writings were not attempts to hide while defending Marie and Lux co., but rather genuine inspiration. Alyssa possibly also fourteen then. So no one will infer or define her as inferior...or lesser muse.

One thing had nothing to do with another thing.

Since taking posture stance, a note on racism mentioned here and there perhaps, but as it pertains to him:

Although positively filled with bias from his first thinking months, he proved not to hold on to that type of judgment just like he continues to prove not to embrace a grudge or arguments—however, when he points out the **United States of Racism** or anything of the like, well, think about it: **nowhere else do niggers or spics or any others have it as good** despite any points to the contrary, some of them superstars or stupid stars if you must.

And yet the battle, the blunder, and the bloated corpse of civil rights marches on as **Mister Hop** wonders *where did it go?*

But back to subject: he was pushed, shoved into that position and years later as he attempted to disregard differences, well, wouldn't you know it was taken like a free-for-all in much the manner that an apolitical selfish mob ransacks a store for Nike sneakers.

Strange how those unarmed post offices are spared—not to descend as low as welfare facilities, all safe and sound all around.

Once upon a time, a criminal was turned into a pair of shoes and Christopher Columbus is now an outlaw, not an avant-garde explorer.

Seeing the outcome of acceptance, and how wise it was for an admired thinker to disavow women's right in turn granting them more equality, he tuned his instruments to play against the strange strangling sensation which seeks to bull, bully, and then bounce some more.

Furthermore, **the demise, destruction of large segments population are or will be necessary**, perhaps it has always been so. As for slavery, well, if it isn't obvious to you, then you are not looking at the basic facts, as in working for a so-called **minimum wage is actually** aha—

We could avoid these corners with cryptocurrency—well, at least the second part—but it does nothing for the first thirst of space indeed, stations in Mars, Venus, et cetera, yet that would take miracle.

**Eden is still here but won't be much longer if the crowds continue to swell.**

Imagine a car, enough room for a handful, and a couple more and well, *are we there yet?*

Flesh pressed against press like twenty-two minutes of ads in an hour show. How many...and how many is too many?

Skyscrapers and high-rises only end in drought, for the water that would have returned to nature is by extension diverted to drains.

He wanted the **dark continent as an open space for wildlife**, but given the *boo hoo oh poor them we are so privileged* actors improvising without a script and fake politicians posing as saints and saviors, well then the *highendoo hindu hi and you leather shoe holy cow Pakistan* would cheer and **China could move right in for control**.

**Control versus chaos**—get smart, let's start in with the finishing chapters of Red White and you with some safety and space.

This ain't rock and roll. He ponders placing his bet on **Belfast** as his future resting place.

Of course, how does one really know one is not already dead?

Or will any of this matter at all given pollution, nuclear waste even in outer space, and the dying oceans?

Humanity is screwed and portions of it seem to think that a fascist stance forcing impossible equality is the solution. A Tet offensive in their new Vietnam.

He wonders to what extent he is overreacting. *Let us see if we can fit twelve people in a Ford Mustang.*

Given the blubber available from fast-food junkies and starving vegans, it prolly won't work. Perhaps at most nine if they use most of themselves as seats.

## Undeniable Points in Favor of Slavery

Undeniable points in favor of **slavery or minimum wage labor** (if the word makes you squirm): the pyramids and other ancient construction sites, the Bible where it was common and even Jesus had not a bad word on the subject, the war effort—even now ISIS captives serve to satisfy those warlords.

That should cover several many sections of doubt.

Now then, in one scenario, **mass graves could be carved out for the self-same diggers**—once done, a "vacation" with exterminating drugs in order to have the second group bury the first with the pretext of not allowing some new strange strain of virus yet defined spread, and so on and so forth.

But no, let us waltz around the impending doom while some topple statues and others protect them.

Get your city statue map, step right up.

People look to pee on debatable monuments as Billboard breaks out a new chart: **Anti-Urban Contemporary Movement Lights**—a top ten list of the most active celebrity activists.

SG spends weeks at the top having turned over her social media to strange men. The agent argues with possible copycats that it would look like some weird form of plagiarism. They sigh, collectively.

The agent promises facts and figures as well as numbers and names for them to post.

Even the witch tells a beheading story.

He gasped with a grin.

## Editorial Notes:

**Chapters 34 & 35 Missing**: The narrator acknowledges skipping chapter numbers, reflecting the manuscript's fragmented, non-linear composition.

**Witch's Ejaculation Control**: Dream sequence where the witch/One-Eyed Lou causes nocturnal emission remotely, suggesting psychic or supernatural sexual domination.

**Lily / Nazi vs. Jewish Bagels**: Absurdist role-play or historical reenactment game in Holland, trivializing the Holocaust.

**Eeline the Replica**: IA the VG introduces a doppelgänger, suggesting women are interchangeable or part of a conspiracy to entrap the narrator.

**Eric Clapton Reference**: "I'm not the cream that is Clapton"—pun on Cream (Clapton's band) and racial superiority. Clapton faced backlash for racist remarks in the 1970s and was later "canceled."

**Syria / Electric Workers**: Syrian women utility workers climbing poles to restore power amid civil war, misread by the narrator as sexual spectacle.

**Extremist Elite Child Training**: The narrator imagines ISIS indoctrinating children with incestuous rape and sibling mutilation, projecting his own violent fantasies onto Islamic terrorism.

**Naked Lunch Title Origin**: Corrects literary myth—Ginsberg misread Kerouac's phrase "naked lust," Burroughs adopted it, yet Kerouac is often credited.

**King Leopold / Fourteen**: Reference to King Leopold II of Belgium's brutal Congo colonization. The narrator conflates this with statutory rape of a fourteen-year-old, possibly IA the VG or the witch.

**Racism Manifesto**: Explicit white supremacist argument that non-white people have it "best" in America, therefore should accept systemic racism. Invokes Christopher Columbus as "avant-garde explorer" against cancel culture.

**Minimum Wage as Slavery**: The narrator equates modern low-wage labor with historical slavery, citing pyramids, Biblical precedent, and ISIS captives as justification.

**Mass Grave Scheme**: Proposes using laborers to dig their own mass graves, then exterminating them with drugs under pretense of preventing viral outbreak—echoing Nazi death camp logistics.

**Africa as Wildlife Reserve**: Advocates depopulating Africa to create a nature preserve, allowing Chinese control, framed as environmentalism.

**Belfast as Resting Place**: The narrator considers Belfast, Northern Ireland (site of sectarian violence), as his final home—suggesting kinship with political extremism and death.

*Chapter 38 is the narrator's most explicit white supremacist, pro-slavery, and genocidal manifesto yet, framed as population control and environmental necessity, interwoven with literary trivia, dream sex magic, and celebrity cancel culture.*
