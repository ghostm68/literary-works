# Chapter Thirteen (Expanded)

---

The struggle to achieve a nap took most of the two days of the weekend.

It was approximately the time when the contagion caught on in most of the I countries.

I ran to see, but like Satan, it had many names.

The new one was **SARS-CoV-2**, **COVID-19**.

Fearing for her safety after amusement park rides, **mule** (round-faced Korean woman, plump body in tight jeans, eyes tracking every stranger with paranoid precision) wore a mask to the coffee and peanut shop, while **the witch** (wrinkled brown skin, one milky eye, teeth filed to points, now more evil than ever) usurped the energy from the floor as her slaves rubbed themselves against her body.

Hard nipples weighed the how and when of pubic-hair sex magic, as she started to give away possessions in order to clear her surroundings for the act.

*City through owners,* he said to a couple of bigwigs. *To run for that office, you need the very personality that man ain't got!*

Late February. He remembers it clearly, for being the time when a series of artworks were done.

*Everyone said when resilient because is east named music.*

In the East. In the Far East.

Rumor had it that, in fact, a cover-up was in play. As the practiced piece stated: *Well, the only level-four Roman-numeral lab in China happens to be in the same city-province where the outbreak began—the beguine.*

Wins, astro, hyper-physics, do-ready chess.

**Lagos, la-ghost, La Jemima Bird** (dark-skinned Australian woman with sharp cheekbones and telepathic intensity, voice crackling through interdimensional static) explained via telepathic Australian transmission: *That is like saying a car can only crash in, say, a factory in Detroit, since they are made there—or used to be.*

Manufacturing job, robot. The crowd blames the Jetsons.

His boy, **El Ron, hubba hubba**, reading by the like-they-after-have-free.

Cut-down-up beatnik reaction line fine—he sees the female-free of the world in a trance that gives him a headache every time: *He lays me down to sleep, pray the Lord her soul to keep.* September, see-through, seep, serpentine torture of words. When they wanted him to be like every other hack, while he fought to make it new. Oh, the nude news that stays poetry. How he freed himself from that zoo is another Berlin Wall matter, or Afghan peace treaty.

Idlib. Hell. Nine-year COVID dream—he was working out a theory about revolution.

Boomerang. The wood cannot be dried. Marinated crabs and persimmon poison. **Barney** (aging retail executive, balding, sagging jowls, eyes hollow from quarterly earnings panic) lowered flagship-store whore. *He told you—now proven—period.* Five million pounds for the whitewash, but he still could go backwards.

Like anything, when there's something to gain—or even gay—well, *speak to me, spic, in your spicorama. Habla, sporte. Deporte.* **Viagra Man** (bloated, red-faced, perpetually semi-erect, desperate for relevance) daughter-prose: tit-toot, soon down-low, determined doctor, same-sex marriage bought the propaganda ticket, took the ride.

Routine and elusive. Why, one might think there was nothing in the world aside from vulgarity, when certain two knees knock together entirely to tax imagination, language, and—dare he say it—laove, yaove, love—or luv. No, wait. Can't we go back to **Lulu** (petite Asian frame, dark eyes flickering with fear beneath the professional smile) getting plugged in to the dance track which empties the palace?

There was no perfect family, and yet his own was a constant punishment—between neglect and the burden of that connection.

Whoa. Week sixty-eight protest. Got to meet the presidente.

*Ever had dinner with the president?* **AHS** (American Horror Story character archetype, pale, gaunt, eyes like black wells) presented the cube in *Apocalypse*. Ice said: *I never have dinner with the president.*

*All right, all ready—as long as Yemen is not mentioned.*

Was **Jemima Bird** foreshadowing? Huh. Literary technique unique. *Someone check to see nobody escaped from the clinique.*

Playing with peanuts while friend pigeoned for a part-time job, **mule** missed the writer, who—suddenly finding himself back in Wuhan space luxury on an empty train—decided to masturbate. Mister-himself, master, he thought. *An empty train in Asia? Well, this might not happen again for hundreds of years.*

Remembering the deformed, crushed bodies of Hindus trampling themselves at the rush-hour stations, or falling off onto cuts and bruises upon the sharp tracks as their ride whistled away, he grinned while the pre-cum curved upward and his Pluto-penis-platonic throbbed, glistening moisture at the tip like school-day spit. He made certain to wait until later. Until late.

It was neither Saturday nor Sunday—more like the middle of the week, those few years later that felt like only minutes had transpired.

With the raging sperm trapped again, he searched through the quasi-blur of the glass to find the town as desolate as the train.

He knows well: none of us matter in the end. Anyone might be replaced, as the divorce rates provide evidence. Or, as **Monsieur Prima** and **Miss Smith** pointed out in the stomp-bop: *Life goes on without me.* Or, if a more modern equivalent is required: **Big Audio Dynamite's** *Life carries on even when I'm not there.*

Well, allow me to amend, in Constitution fashion: while some say very few individuals are—or become—indispensable, most of us are not. Yet during that ride, he felt as if he were one of the most important people on the planet.

Sort of like an infant held by the invisible arms of a mother-goddess-queen-saint-groovy sort of girl.

**Feral white feline** (skinny, matted fur, yellow eyes wild with hunger and distrust)—as if magic, the pork chop from the skies—ran with a bit-bite. He adored the feeling of feeding a familiar, and watched for the return wherein frenzy was replaced by deliberate gnash and gnaw. Yes, even claw, for the bone-stuck meat law.

Adjusting his face mask, he did not look back in regret at leaving his second-floor H-2 offices, or the peekaboo illegal surveillance by whatever means: *la esposa joven*, seven, CDN, *deportes*, eight, honk, insane, CVS, light-flash, knock, door, beggar-no-legs-husband, or the neighbor loudspeakers. Yet his plants he did mourn. For a city kid to grow trees is—well, magic—as he stepped onto the station's platform on his way to hotel, to write these notes that could offer no alternative explanation of the outbreak, except to note that throughout recorded "time," there has always been a meteor-esque thing.

Let us, ladies and gentlemen, live with the fact that we have become the dinosaur, and there's nobody hardly here to blame: from 1945 radiation, constant-cost, radio alert, oil spill, ocean kill, Agent Orange, power-plant asbestos, World War Three—or worst: us. What a thrill.

The R and U countries followed, but that did not mean **Coronavirus**, cum **COVID-19**, cum **SARS-CoV-2**, was at the top of the Billboard charts—not by a long shot. Sure, it was rising with a bullet, but first we needed to brainwash the American population for the upcoming election. That is to say: **BS Mr. Magoo** (bumbling, half-blind cartoon character recast as political figure, squinting at teleprompters, stumbling through speeches) had to be made to loki-look: *What? Heart attack? Which grandchild dead? Not me! I got Mighty Mouse super-formula, USSR solution contribution: two hands and a dildo electric.* So there, socialism. So much the writer could have puked—vomit everywhere, anywhere. Still, we all know how it true-turned out now. Now. No need to shout.
