# Chapter Eleven (Expanded)

Does not everyone feel the synth?

The sin of our quick, post-modern, synthetic emotions—detached from any root—reality.

He disremembers the word *desensitized*, or rather, the correct spelling.

Remembering the meaning, weighing the frenzied callousness once and again thrown into rex-*Red White*.

Hex *Red White*. It is, perhaps—what is that unwanted isolationism, as if an entire nation with an imposed foreign policy so strict it might make him sick?

Sick as a dog, he howls after himself to retain some truth of identity.

Sitting at a café with **jizz-fat Korean wife-mule** (round face, plump body tucked into a tight sweater, skin like porcelain, eyes that tracked his every micro-expression with the vigilance of a surveillance camera), yellow cell phone and headphones on the narrow table, he sees her beauty. Yet hosk—his look tinted with fear. **Elsa** (pale Scandinavian skin, blue eyes like arctic ice, lips perpetually chapped). Trouble sleeping. Perhaps leaving the Wuhan hotel was not a great idea, as reported cases and paranoia pranced through South Korea.

She thong-thinks he likes her tits, and he does—yay—yet it ain't the nipple or cup. Pup-up bark of curve. It is something *other* about her that hounds him, sweetly sweet.

Can we live with them? Question mark. No.

To live with them is to lose ourselves—or worse, *loosen* ourselves.

Alone too long, it names tears nobody ever saw, and makes him weep deep within, invisible emotions of loss and despair.

Ah, yes, **Hiatt** lyric: *I can be tough, I can be tender.*

He is not, however, thinking of surrender, but the seed of this tome.

There's another song on that record that speaks of a possible origin. What is it? Yes. Uhm, unnamed forces kill his love, but the singer insists: *The wind doesn't have to worry—she was already dead.*

Don't die in the middle of the day. Always wait for night.

Little deaths, mostly none care. Careless living. Yet once in a blue moon, there it is: a case that brings you down to proverbial knees.

And so it was—like Dresden in Germany, or the two flights over Japan—evaporation of souls in an instant. That girl from Barnard (**Tessa Majors**, young, vibrant, brown skin, curly hair, eyes full of ambition and promise) that happened upon her death while crossing the nefariously famous-for-wickedness **Morningside Park**.

Hark. Hell. He said feathers came flying out. Of course, he being a culprit—not the *he* herein, nor the *hee-her Kim*, if you get me, Jim.

The *he herein* made a connection to the Amherst **Emily** (Dickinson, pale face in daguerreotype, severe center part, eyes that burned with quiet fury and genius) early on, and the impression remained stamped like a tattoo upon the soul.

Seoul. Hmm. Yes. Well, the line that perched in that spirited place.

Three-against-one episode. Revolt. Every night visitation.

He didn't want to, and certainly didn't need to explain, yet it all fit together, alike pieces of a jigsaw puzzle—meaning, there is the catalyst.

Desolation. His own. That inconsistent sorrow, never really as much as his joy and pride—silent within his very core, infinite, even beyond sadness, mostly—the trivial manner, or lack of manners, given to **Dickinson**, one of the few among millions to slant her truth in such a way that left only awe. Or, it seems, in the case of sit-down-uation, come-die envy. And he speaks not of it more, or again, for being friends—or having been—with the protagonist producer. And finally, the demise of that girl, so near our homes. The aforementioned room of many meanings, and the rooms of my beatnik angel-devil crowd: the naked road, *Howl*, *Nova*, *Lunch*.

Ah, look, pook—it's only a hunch, but don't you see? The end of that girl is also a new end of the world. For if it us-isn't, then all is everything meaningless.

The *he* part of three (young Black boys, ages thirteen to fourteen, baggy jeans, hoodies, eyes hollow from generational neglect and systemic rage) out for a cell-phone grab, money brag, maybe weed. She fought—nail, tooth. They were three of part-ghetto-play kids, middle-school kids. Imagine it. Well, don't. It ain't nothing. But some will call them names and blame these darkies, as a lot of others blame the Jew—blade, bed, wed, wet—and/or Muslim—raid, head, med, met, mera, et cetera.

To look back, gazing at the mansion of **Genedos**—

Genesis. Well, it is a wo-det wonder to him, but nothong—or tits—nothing in contrast to his me-mule, or how expensive a Starbucks has ever been or become.

Synth. The feel. Everyone not does. Yes—hard to explain through the pain of years, Yeats, experience, perception. Possibly all his love—too much love—could not hold on enough to hold her hand without hearing the past revolve, as bulldozers removed the structures recently built to sustain the virus captive in India and Afrikkka. For science now said the very walls were contaminated, like graffiti on Manhattan subways when spray paint was in fashion.

New plastic passion of the boo-biodegradable variety was employed to adobe the whoever-got-it-growing-again: C-one-nine.

See nineteen. Hey, we can't dance at all. Hall of—he still hears her, and all the newly dead look like deserved—the deserved vengeance of a girl determined to get back to her dorm.

There might not be no coloured men left in peace throughout the northern cities by the time this book gets published, or pushed down into a bestseller list as the ravings of a writer desperate for attention in quasi-historical annotations. But his dear readers know it, sense it, *feel* it—the **Wuhanlity** quality that cannot be counterfeit.

In sum: after some things, nothing matters.

You—*No justice, no peace*—might be tempted to argue for pacifism. But a swift overview of timelines and terror will point out your error. Or you maybe feel that the revenge sensatoon-soon-sensation should be reserved for fam-famy-familay—say, a daughter. Bit-coin, hey, lit-coin, to-conference, sit-coin-or-stand. He agrees, and that is precisely the point—no, not the child his own, but worse: *OURS*—where there are no hours to make up for the loss, gloss over the double-triple cross.

Does not everyone…
