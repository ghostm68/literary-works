# Chapter 28: Chapter Forty (Sections 40.1 - 40.60)

## 40.1: Desert Sands and Deception

Forty years desert sands with these hands...

How did we miss this possible explanation? Not the heeb, he says, but the thirteen million lawsuit given to twenty-two women who claimed deception, coercion—corroborated in several places. He paces the argument, an excellent source of material, like children calling each other grade school names.

To brevity: some New Zealand semen sacks made Californication photo shoots, San Diego stories—he knows this from press, former Miss Teen runner-up, et cetera. To now hear some behind-the-scenes horror and the court ruling, plus one still on the run...

He is not saying any of this matters. It is all prelude to introduce a gimmick and maybe even return full circle.

You see, or if not that sense, imagine these were reportedly the places: **Kimpton Palomar, Coronado Island Marriott, Hard Rock, Hilton Bayfront, and the La Valencia**.

It jumps out right straight away: *Coronado* for the pandemic or the Sopranos...yes, *Corrado*, but near enough. Besides, there is prequel or sequel in the works. Corona virus, that mafia with face masking asking quarantine...

**Sex video filmed at the Coronado Island Marriott Hotel...**\*

Heavy hot—oh, hot and heavy he means in terms of word play. A field day for his meanings. *Covid* or *Corona* sprinkled either way and still room for nineteen...letter S if numeric anagram.

Death words, yet what could they signify?

Could there be a Chinese connection? *Wuhan* in *Hubei*...hmm: *one in obey*.

Oh baby, can you feel the possibilities?

Which one...province, can't prove it...

I know you want it...here it comes, your nineteenth nervous anagram:

**"COVID ODD DEATH AT EARTH RIOT TOO IF IMMORAL SEX LENS"** from asterisked line above.

Wild, huh? Or weird? Or with that many letters/numbers you could—and yet it works to some distant logic under the waves. It cannot be precise for him not knowing how to order the words in right form—that is, should the word "room" be included? Is "the" even necessary? Many questions of no answers. Statistics will need to suffice...or go with gut feeling.

It is what he has done. Beyond that, it feels right. Even righteous.

Apologies if you were expecting a sex scene romp to stomp at. Stamp mail suddenly—ah, the perks of being a writer, perhaps a poet. There is something here he cannot define yet cannot defy. And if it is the root cause of cough drop senses gone dead, well, perhaps you will thank him later on down the road.

## 40.2: The Easy Version—Faith, Belief, and the Lord as Gangster

The easy version goes like this: As much as one or another may go in wanting to reveal fraud in religion—which is actually pretty easy if one is so inclined—one cannot dismiss the determination of believers, of belief or faith.

That is, when the explosion detonates from what was once a suicide bomber's vest and the limbs of humans and fractured pieces of the place litter the area, well indeed, *Allah is great*, you will hesitantly agree.

Or when a child recognizes the possessions of his spirit's previous life and thus proves—or at least provokes thought—like the déjà vu dream or experience the more intuitive of us have all felt, like waking up from that endless fall, well, it requires near approval of reincarnation.

Or when parts of the gentile crowd go down expired, dead, at that critical holiday Jews hold to be holy while the Hebrews wait it out, alive to strive, well, ain't that the Lord at work? Ordain it now—this you cannot argue with logic or science.

That is to introduce the idea behind the asterisk and astute word play.

One of those girls was the proverbial preacher's daughter and another from the Mormon side of the fence. However one weighs the Jesus factor, it cannot be taken lightly. And if he had to guess, well, one of those hurting families hurled all the power of faith against that pornographic enterprise. Sure, *Nacho Libre* against Ramses, but the outcome is the point, and that joint is still smoking.

To further furnish this sort of before-and-after chapter, think of it like Democrats in the Stay Statez: convention previous 20s century, a literal Ku Klux Klan rally—in other words, origin to contrast—a mere forty years later with Kennedy and his equal rights morality. Yes, a party or a priesthood might evolve as far as that or even further, it seems. It depends on the persons involved.

We cannot remove the seed or the planting of it, yet the growth might be moved this way or that, as far as all the way across the oceans in some cases.

He would like to invoke *El Hombre Invisible* yet again to conclude: the most powerful curse might well be the casual curse. And here he repeats the paraphrase to make exact his meaning of a preacher's daughter revenge, as it were.

If anything in the Bible is true, it is that **the Lord is gangster in the genocidal sense of the word**...yes, the most prolific serial killer he has ever read about.

Consider the boat. And yes, the boats keep happening.

## 40.3: Seismic Shifts—India, Trump, and Apocalyptic Politics

He started the book with an inclination that that city in China might face destruction, yet it seems now, a few months later, that it will survive in one fashion or another.

He had no idea that the real peril lay within India. As he typed, six earthquakes had hit New Delhi in seismic gentle nudges over the previous month, and China had started the land grab after the confidence provided at the skirmish. Translation dictionaries for the Russian arms were argued over as Putin was kept in place for what they said would be sixteen years.

He worried—not enough—and also that there was a shadow agency at play with an already-set-in-motion plan to prevent Trump's second term.

Batman and Robinette were going to premiere hell or high water or even factual future details. Or how could Joe grope anybody now in the middle of a pandemic?

*Let me have a kitten—I mean a Black woman running mate*, he begged.

*Joe, you don't have that much jam*.

Still, they were making a fuss and a fight, everything short of coming out and saying the ex-president was born outside of America and those ain't even his children.

### Dystopian Fantasy Interlude:

*I stand before you today to admit that it was all bullshit: me, my law practice, the book, the wife, the kids. And yes, gay rights was only to stop people from making more of themselves, but dammit, the adoptions got out of hand as we hinted with the stand-in for Anderson Cooper and all. Well, now that we are clearing out part of the population wholesale with the virus, why not vote for a man that has dedicated his life to feeling up women and girls?*

The crowd cheers, storms the White House. *We don't care what he say or do...* Trump, Melania, and Barron lynched.

Flyers are sent out: **PARTY IN THE BUNKER, BYOB.**

Kardashians step in to run the government and deport Frances Bean Cobain to an undisclosed location. Paris Hilton is named Secretary of State. Mass suicides of so-called poor white trash are reported across the country. Karen listed as an endangered species. America joins the African Nations Union. Flags are burned because of the white stars and stripes and soon replaced by a spray-painted X on a pink background.

Blackpink pens the new national anthem, lifting yet another line from the Rolling Stones' *Tattoo You*...

Look at you, we were riding in this long black limo and dreaming a cousin we ain't seen in twenty-five years has got into a fight and wants us to join, handing Uzi machine gun falling apart...

Somewhere a lie... Lay awake, yeah, but what a story to take out and snack on. Oh, the real fun will be editing all this out of time.

## 40.33: Counter Waiting, Cromwell, and Aileen Wuornos

Counter waiting he was and saw behind hazy glass the photocopied pictures in Xerox black and white as if surveying that he was not wanted. Scenes before, mostly somehow *Miss Goo Avower*, as if we had known each other all over the palace of years.

*Cromwell, head chopped off*—he studied the floor. Could not find the remembrance of that history in his thoughts...the name did seem familiar.

The day, then the night in a nearly drug trance of interrupted sleep dream scene and the nap as if seeking continuity, swallowed in sweat moist.

Music of **Aileen Wuornos** he read, knowing now certain there was an innocent woman forced to death penalty after trying to defend herself from seven men. He makes the pushed-around context: after the first time one is stopped and subjected to that silly torture, all the rest of even certain nearness becomes ground—valid ground of self-protection. Her reaction at the sentence, anyone so fed up with lack of logic or respect will recognize.

Flashback brought back memories of Japan, while an American in Korea showed the care package from the government—the care.

Four Jew lie...the Fourth it is and yet he cannot feel the party there.

He had been thinking along these lines: So people are dying—dozens, hundreds, thousands, et cetera. Do we solemnity? Do we reflect? Do we anything? No, wait—we bounce like puppet balls over a single death meant to be the straw that broke whatever into riot, race war against statues and names and history itself until, as one editorial put it, we wind up with more dead and hollowed-out department stores than ever before, not to mention a little rise in terms of infections.

Makes sense? Fuck yeah...no. Not by any stretch of the imagination.

Death match in demented politics cage: Lebanon, Yemen, Venezuela.

No, he already nearly wept for that woman and there are no more tears for these tragedies as the aging man puts the gun to his head, no longer willing to walk down that hungry avenue, and pulls the trigger in a final act of *I cannot feed my family*. The empty coffin neither smiles nor grins as bald-headed boys bend to send him to that narrow resting place between oblivion and regret.

But is it his or ours?

Then as the millions of dollars in fireworks explode, emergency meeting: *Who the hell could pose as a viable candidate in twenty-four?* If only Kiefer Sutherland weren't Canada...

The post-second-term Trump...well, maybe finally a woman. Yes, a robot woman immune to the Rona and willing to work that 24 and seven. Or simply Ivanka?

Wherein the writer pauses in order to refrain from a Brimism...you know, Chinese Chairman erect as desert cactus donates ten million to her campaign while drooling over her glowing countenance.

Is he back with the Goo or is it only wishful thinking in dreams? Does the executed so-called serial killer dream, or does she bide her time until he sees her pain to paint it on the page for eternity as she promised in her ending paragraph back like Jesus Independence...Jefferson, Adams...jams even his own awe within the impossible improvisation and perhaps mistakenly ceases to pen, write, type so as to have a look at this poem while it is still breathing with a sigh.

## 40.36: Dream of Cul-de-Sac, Execution Conversation

He'd walked the dream haunted and after making love found himself in cul-de-sac. There, men in green military shirts he tried to avoid, only to get trapped trying to explain where he lived, by that time hungry and picking at chicken that tasted like ginger root.

The word *Sarasota*, except he no longer lives on that avenue.

It is all there for the poem, but it is not yet a poem. It needs the execution conversation, her ass sabotaged, her warning nuked in 2019, or as we have translated, *COVID nineteen*...the following year.

In his emotion, he cannot write...he needs to wait a minute or more.

After the election take a death picture flower cake. Jackal howling in derisive weirdness. Puppet strings never visible. *Meet the new bossy pants, same as the old pants bossy*.

Young adult Daniella and Marie he wrote to Mingy. Where is tomorrow going...reflections. Yes and then no, does it matter?

Before long three in the morning, numb as the dumb as if body snatchers have decided to go for overtime. Overt—his right knee seems breathe every now and again. Perhaps only exhale...which sounds fictional yet was fact. A moveable nose!

Invitations to New York City and the ragtime breadline rent shop bent bebop. They have turned it into a hypnotic song. He can't help but sing along ranting steps dance the poor idiot.

Another day, yet there was this.

## 40.40: Cromwell, Daniella's Head, and the Knife Dream

Flashback, dream while engaged in careless talk: the intruder he stabbed trying to enter his home. Knew the knife, it all seemed so perfectly practiced. He had woken distracted and filled with thoughts of Daniella and desire.

There it was, another birthday and banana memories—the little monster girl with rising teeth, *look at my nose*, competed with pulled groin whiskey dick things and thongs he had not wanted to consider.

She quotes Colossians Two. He wonders...listens to *Way Down in the Hole*. Emma considers the hard grub.

He is going for the fourteen hundred peso almond cake. Happy birthday, **Mary Wohlwend**. Calvary whim swim him, listening as IA the VG slays the piano rendition in a hood so good, her voice.

There was a Rump Parliament—Cromwell his own self, a so-called Roundhead. He sees the Daniella head cut out in his mind, cannot concentrate on Oliver. Perhaps doesn't want to instinctively, knowing how many pages this manuscript already overloads.

But still, to even try to weigh **"Rich a rd mall or y"**: Interstate Seventy-Five, first victim against quasi ritzy Bella Vista Mall Sarasota frisk vision strobe light and surrounding streets, is to blow one's own mind.

*Take me with you to the Mini Apple...*

No.

## 40.60: Drastic Day, Dream of Vomiting Girl

Weather or not, it felt like some sort of drastic day, all devoid of meaning, movement.

He sat down to write down...yet felt drunken although he had been sober since...since he could not recall. A while, as it was only a while wherein the at-last dream he stood before a little girl, skinny, perhaps ten or twelve, and embraced her tears as she started vomiting a light colored fluid over his left shoulder.

It was the middle of the road as in the Pretenders song, possibly in the thirties in Manhattan—Grand Central—who knows. Someone spoke and he held her nearer, dearer, as to him it was the child **Say or See**. And while he leaned down, knees bent to breathe alongside her pain, he could feel the grown Say or See pulling off his hat, which he did not want, wished removed, for not having styled in the manner he would want to be seen through.

And so he stood and crossed the avenue of yellow taxis and fat women sprawled across the asphalt open-legged in baggy pants and he wondered at the weirdness, then awoke before he could reach the north side of that ninth or tenth avenue where his fan seemed to sound out some sort of bizarre down-under squeal. Yet as he fixed his squint to see what it was saying, he realized it was coming from the side window of his bedchamber—some men at work, nothing Australian about it.

He had gone to bed hungry and quickly twisted up some coffee and tasted some more of the almond cake, perhaps thinking of Mary or Andi or even Andi's mother in premonitory celebration...then settled back to sleep after placing the stray cot mattress over those side windows to press against the noise.

## Editorial Notes:

**Coronado/Corona Anagram**: The narrator engages in conspiratorial wordplay linking the Coronado Island Marriott (site of filmed pornography in a lawsuit) to COVID-19 through anagrams and phonetic associations, suggesting hidden connections between moral corruption, sexual exploitation, and pandemic as forms of spiritual warfare.

**The Lord as Gangster**: A recurring theological critique—the narrator sees divine violence (floods, plagues, genocides) in the Old Testament as evidence that if God exists, He operates with mob-like ruthlessness. Faith is validated not by goodness but by raw power and survival outcomes.

**Aileen Wuornos Reframing**: The narrator reinterprets the executed serial killer as a woman defending herself after repeated sexual assault, arguing that once violated, all subsequent defensive violence becomes justified self-protection. Her reaction to sentencing is read as justified rage against illogic and injustice.

**Dystopian Political Fantasy**: The narrator projects an apocalyptic America where truth collapses entirely, Trump is lynched, the Kardashians rule, and BLACKPINK writes the national anthem—a satirical collapse into total cultural incoherence and celebrity autocracy.

**Say or See (Daniella)**: A recurring dream figure, possibly muse or lost love, who appears as both child and adult. The narrator's fixation on her is intertwined with themes of protection, desire, and unresolved grief. The vomiting child in the dream may symbolize innocence corrupted or the narrator's inability to save or heal.

**Cromwell and Decapitation**: Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector and regicide, functions as historical mirror for revolutionary violence and the cyclical nature of power. The narrator struggles to remember him fully, suggesting history itself is fragmenting or being forgotten in the narrator's deteriorating consciousness.

**Fourth of July / Four Jew Lie**: Paranoid anagram linking American independence to anti-Semitic conspiracy, consistent with the narrator's schizophrenic pattern-finding in language, dates, and cultural symbols.

*Chapter 28 captures the narrator's descent into anagram-driven paranoia, theological cynicism, and dream-blurred memory, where pornography lawsuits, pandemic wordplay, and historical figures blend into a fragmented meditation on faith, violence, and the collapse of meaning.*
