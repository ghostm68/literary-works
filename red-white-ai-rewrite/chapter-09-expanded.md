# Chapter Nine (Expanded)

---

Two Jews walk into the Democratic Caucus. One says: *No condom, psycho-socialism.* And the other apologizes for switching from lubricant Republican, but will pay your squadron of telemaze phone marketeers, TV add-on.

**Demo-crack.** Both have smoked eight hours straight. Bug-eyed **No Condom** (gaunt face, wild eyes like a cornered animal, sweat beading on his forehead, fingers trembling from the cocaine) has also done a few lines. But **the Apology** on the other elbow (softer features, morphine-glazed eyes half-lidded, false smile plastered on like a mask) has greased in morphine, giving himself a queer air of *I'm doing this all for you. Here, let me kiss somebody.*

**Demo-high.** Neither want to mention: is it really Israel? Benny? Moss? Or anything too ethnic in terms of the J-word. One seems down to fly into fight. The other, not so much—only casual, as if he has studied Mrs. Kennedy taking over in Spanish, to the delight of the *speak-to-me-spic-in-your-spicorama* sound, and can't way-wait to try out hisself on the hussy-reporter-filled crowd.

**Demo-Dinkinstein** is where it was headed. Frankenstein. It was nearly as bad as you cannot imagine. I was ready to vote for *Beheaded!*

Or like in the Dom Rep with the glitch, when they could have let it go, but no—*We wanna go for it, full plátano, next month.* Hell, we might remove Sunday from the calendar!

So the incumbent won, as if this was going to surprise nobody, nowhere. Peek-a-news. But even so, he thin-thinks: *I told you so.* Landslide.

*Ho, Grandma loved a sailor who sailed the seven seas.*

Son, Sony, Sonny—it's the United States of *Am I Crazy?*—so it needs to be put, pointed out.

Now then, vack-tack-tavern, back to story: Astoria Hotel, or Queens Borough. Oh, Burroughs. *When me, you fly, I am the wings.*

Sings as things in rings as flings in brings the burden of Chapter Nine, thumbing still—as was Eight—the pros and cons of hitch-cell-phone riding. High king.

Keyboard before it again begins.

Well then, there then now. Thumb-typing a few pages really is like marriage after a few months. He is thinking, knowing he should be grateful, but hot dog—he still can't change money at a fair rate without being hounded.

As writer, his journey has been made harder by the adherence to a sort of cult of self. And while he has attempted to explain or elaborate on parts of this here, there is much more that could be wroted. The *what-you-know-slash-in-front-of-you* philosophy, not to mention the need or desire to stand away from the hack formulas you will find everywhere else. They work, sure, but it felt to him that this was the manner in which to style, to carve out his latest creation.

In any case, back to the story, as it were.

The Jews were pissed—not that this was unusual. For wouldn't you be, if the women you held in marriage handed out horny looks at the likes of the writer?

He got up that afternoon, in the middle of Chapter Nine, very prepared to make flight arrangements to see how the works were going in India.

*Would you like an oxygen tank and industrial-strength air-freshener spray with your hotel room?* For some reason, it was still entirely polluted—yes, even with the people all gone. He figured some of them left their engines running.

Of course, as it happened, nothing could be done that particular day, as various nefarious groups attacked. Some of them, he surmised, must have been the Heebs, for it was what he had been writing down in his notes for *Red White*, a novel in progress.

Getting up, he felt it: the strange sensation of not being as he had been—or, as the elite press call it, *climate change*.

He had been dealing with climate change since the pee wars. Circa *érase una vez*, ahem, **Lola**.

An undiluted Mexican soap that washed well with him and his lifelong friend **Miss G** (petite, dark-haired, eyes like polished obsidian, voice like honey over gravel)—no relation to **Mister G, the Weather Man** on Eleven. Pix, pix, pix. He did not win.

No wine. All whine. Some weirdo trying to tell toilet stories within his head, and it weren't even Chinese women pee. See? PC. Picsy. As he tried to dream. And to not dream is to die—except in meth labs, where the chef needs to be wide awake. One could scream, but what is the point?

No joint. All menthol, cigarette, coffee. *We are turning on the water like a theater piece*—meaning: blow you down, bowl discomfort, despite the fact you didn't eat. Double-barrel action. Let's see how long we can keep pretending a colon is a car trunk. *Open,* says **Amy** (round face, dimples, cheerful voice that belied the cruelty of her words).

Any ol' fool anagram doorway analysis.

He wasn't doing anything Army, so it's fair game. Hmm. Should we park the toilet-paper truck nearby?

Of course, sometimes *turning on the water* was turned—or translayed—as bringing in semen. Or, as you will Instagram recall: *Pee is stored in the balls.*

The worst time was after recording his lullaby duet, wherein he was so thrilled, only to be killed by the *make-a-butthole-suffer-sure* surfers: *If everybody had an ocean.*

That time, he pressed on to gain the third take, which has since overtaken the others as a favorite. Yet to have to find ways around one's own body without reason—well, what it is, it, Johnny? *Nobody told me there'd be days like these.*

This time, he pretty much gave up, not wanting to grind against the idiocy compounded by an assault with strangers at the mall—not to mention the electricity power cut. It seemed to him to have certain segments miss a few news programs until the government-friendly novelas came on the air.

Or maybe some fanatic was intent on annotation, for footnotes in the encyclopedia version of *Red White*: *We gotta stop him before we lose the trail. Grab him by the tail. He's with One-Eyed Lou. Yes, the umbilical cord, long gone. But time, gentlemen, as you know, does not exist.*

In reality, he understood: some people were furious. Or, as the spokeswoman for Lancôme stated: *Well, some people don't even want you to exist.*

The *Anal Love TV* ad crossed his mind: support group circle for Santa Claus and the like.

Ex-is-T. T is for Texas. Poor white-trash boys cheer him on, still horrified by their girls giving it up raw-dog to beaners and coons. *Oh, come on, Frankie, relax. Where's your team spirit?* Yeah, he was honorary Texan. Mister Ghost Connections promised to not write about no lynch mob in them parts, as one good turn deserved another—even if silence had been equated with death. *Details, Princess Orgasm. You gotta understand how it feral-feels like a federal infraction to have your girl's pussy invaded by inni-minni-minnie-Moe-Green immigrants, and have to stand there like, yeah, whatever.*

Now, despite living in the age of sound bites out of context, to weigh the writing—well, noby-nobody-Moby would be able to find any dick-hint of antipathy. Only facts. Well, yes, some are imagined, but it is after all a novel.

Ahem. *Full Metal*: *There is no racial bigotry* jacket *here. Yes, here you are all equally worthless.*

No heroin. He was not trying to hide. Freely, he would admit a dislike of, say, the fat in general—but even therein one would find an exception. The point is: mostly, people go along in groups, with or without the valuable resource of segregation. And it is proven, time and again, throughout history.

The natural state—the beauty of racism—needs to be embraced. Otherwise, it will strangle us all with that impossible race to "equality."

Never was. Never will be. Not in the jungle. Not on the asphalt of Joplin, Missouri.

To say otherwise, especially in economic terms, is to lie.

As for the kicking kikes—well, beats me. As you might agree: bacon.

Is that it? Does it come down to pork?

The argument might be sound enough, yet it would leave the Muslim maniacs in the same boat.

Jesus cast the demon into a pig, but come on—it was *one pig*, unless there was a pig apocalypse with only a demonized swine left to swipe his prepaid penis card within the few remaining female piglets.

Hmm. What will happen to India? Will there be some Kali-infused high-caste member left to build up Bollywood?

Next novel idea: British secret agents (trench coats, steely eyes, crisp accents, colonial arrogance barely concealed beneath professional detachment) gather at global points to track down the last Hindu (haggard, skeletal, eyes wild with desperation and lust, hands trembling as he violates another corpse in a New Delhi morgue) who has been trying to get as many women pregnant as possible—even dead women, when he can't find live ones.

*Ma'am, do we castrate or terminate?*

*Both,* she says (sharp-featured British commander, graying hair pulled back tight, eyes cold as Thames fog) with a seriousness that leaves only room to raise an eyebrow.

*Both, you fools. The national museum needs its artifacts, and I'd like to have a look at those family jewels myself. Besides, left alive, he could write a tell-all, go on the tele, and record a podcast. No, no. Both. And good riddance.*

*So good to feel like an empire again.*

He did not make love to his wife that night. He raged against the ass-jam Jews and governments and societies intent on distraction, as he ravaged her. And although it felt good for a few hours, after, he was left with the bitter taste of not having given her his best.

A reflection of an earlier girl (spring skirt, tan boots, brown hair catching sunlight, face serene as a Madonna) smelling a flower on full turn in front of him, as he crossed the avenue so as not to run-on-ruin her nature vibe.

He felt: to make love was to go all the way into heaven and hold on to a lightness in the clouds as the stars shone alongside the moon, with the sun invisible on the other side of the divide. Yes, to make love required all of the self and none of the bullshit, which would in turn make it simply hollow—or that common procreation of subhuman species from some forced missionary position. Babies later groomed to work the corporate world order in a vicious circle, never-ending, no-way-out roundabout.

Perhaps he had to wait for the next chapter to make love with the etiquette and respect a woman deserved—not that some bitches should not be tied down and spanked until they pee their last drop, mind you.

Two Jews walk into the porn industry. *Did you read the book?* **Tied Down and Spanked**, spread out into a dozen movies. *Tied Down and Spanked One*. *Tied Down and Spanked: Double or Nothing*. *Tied Down and Spanked When the Doorbell Rang (Here's Three's Company)*. *Tied Down and Spanked Four Your Consideration*. *Tied Down and Spanked: Live at Five*.

Fee-fi-fo-fum. I smell smoke in the auditorium.

Half-Chinese **Tilly Meg** (almond eyes, sharp cheekbones, petite frame, perpetually anxious expression) looks as if holding a breath for the answer in another movie—

A sequel, in fact—

Before the question comes—it never goes away—the answer.
