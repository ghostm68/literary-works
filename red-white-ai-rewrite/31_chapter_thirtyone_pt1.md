# Chapter 31: Chapter Thirty-One

## April, T.S. Eliot, and Two Laurens

To look away from here and glimpse the start of that April—oh **T.S. Eliot**—now a lot of you were saved from tell jobs. Oh, it seems such a distance. Where are his stolen binoculars and the penis-sized lighter with the crosses?

A heart-shaped mirror. He wanted to write a story or a song about **two Laurens**.

Yet he had stayed awake too long, wanting to early out. The aisle he found a line as Russian ration day as the snow sprinkled white over **Pinsk walkways**.

*You can't get in without a mask*, as if the impromptu doorman was **spic Spicorama** telling the writer something...something new.

*These masks they only reflect all our inner disguises...tel or tell or cell the truth and you ain't got far to go...no.*

Walking away, he lamented the jacket choice and checking in on the second choice for shopping found another long line and returned to switch costumes.

Going with the costume, the face mask felt heavy and warm as the air conditioning was down or off for some reason.

He stood behind a pregnant woman, but by the time he got in she weren't pregnant no more.

The hour that seemed to drag on like a blunt with more cigar than weed.

## American Thighs, Trump in Home Alone, and Two Kopeks

At least there was one woman that entertained him for reminding him of Miss Goo Avower and perhaps **Miss Rob All My Wine**.

A short romper as if mini-skirt with back exposed and bra label seemingly pulled out on purpose—sure, a bit chubby with what **AC/DC** termed **American thighs**.

Pause, he ate like an American that night.

Then said to himself, *Oh look, Trump was giving directions in Home Alone TV replay, so perhaps this will be like Xmas*.

Still, a nice distraction, and when fin finally he reached the frozen chickens she was there grabbing a couple and they stood so near he actually prayed to the witch.

*Number nine, number nine*, she responded with the number forty-eight.

Later realized that the mask gives one a type of isolation wherein if one can hold on, pretense and posers drop out like inner-city high school kids before graduation and one is left momentarily feeling like one's self—or perhaps it was only him and his fueled-up-by-research affection for Miss Goo Avower.

Hard to say. In the dream they spoke, something about her past, a new agreement, and the haunting request to send her **two kopeks**.

In other words, a fraction of a cent...scent...what could it mean? He pondered and pounded through various codes like English secret agent attempting to play German games.

## Hesse, Elsa, Central Park Tents, and Bill

**Hesse the finance minister found dead—total war railroad tracks.**

Thomas, **Elsa** in a pretzel out for almond milk—panicked, *let me shoe you some of my shoes*, but all he saw was the teenager still visible in her eyes as if Swedes had found a way to stop time.

All the talk of angels yet she is a real heavenly being.

Bouncing from the scenes, he gazed at the tents adorning Central Park and now there was no doubt **Bill** had been let in to handle the eastern section.

Kopeks...possibly **Brooke**, at turns both brunetter and blonder.

Yet Miss Goo Avower had mentioned wanting two dogs although he could not see how they could help with art history or interior design.

Areas of study. He counted the money, joked, *Are you also working as a doctor after you make these drops?* The messenger laughed, *Yeah, it looks like we are all doctors*. He signed and sighed.

## LA Mayor, Camilla, Prince Charles, and the Hindus in Michigan

Meanwhile the Mayor of Los Angeles became building manager for rent payments as **Camilla** demanded to see her **Price**—it was a close call and they had to release the Price from isolation to avoid scandal.

The hurry to clean and clear any traces of hanky-panky took a team of dedicated and trained professionals. *Now remember, Price always with the face turned down and that half squint eye droop so she won't suspect.*

It had to be as awkward as Andi pleading with the writer, *Well what about the Hindus in Michigan?* Oh, to be young and full of love, hope, charity. He ran away like **Charles Bukowski** and began to dig.

Some situations even he could not face while expecting at any time little teeny bopper girls dripping ice cream to sneak peak into his hole.
