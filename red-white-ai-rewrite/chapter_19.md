# Chapter Nineteen

episode three, after not allowing him a monuts peace at that knock knock pace no face serial killers minutes...even the freaking phone cop any - three LA rumania...real maniacs for wasting time - 

*Los Angeles as Rumania—the Hollywood hills transposed onto Transylvanian geography, the movie industry as vampiric enterprise draining blood and money from willing victims. Three LA: the trinity of the city (Downtown, Westside, Valley), or three instances of Los Angeles stacked like transparencies—the real city, the filmed city, the imagined city. The knock knock pace: door-to-door salesmen, police raids, serial killers in slasher films always knocking before entering. No face because faces don't matter in LA—only bodies, only the surface the camera reads.*

a while back sure, but it is vivid as ten pesos ice cream ten pesitos...

*Ten pesos ice cream from a carrito on Sunset Boulevard, or in Koreatown where the paletas man pushes his cart past the KBBQ restaurants. Ten pesitos—diminutive, the small currency of memory, but vivid as brain freeze, as the sugar rush that outlasts the melting.*

besides high profile types began to tell whoever was goofy fool enough to full listen, hey no newspaper today, mister you know who has caught the illness ...

*The high-profile types: actors, politicians, the people whose faces sell magazines. "You know who"—the celebrity who cannot be named, the president whose illness becomes state secret, the public figure whose body is public property. The president's personal life is archaeological site, every sneeze a headline, every cough a crisis. His marriage, her medication, their late-night phone calls—all excavated, analyzed, monetized. To be president is to surrender privacy, to have one's prostate exams discussed on cable news, one's bedroom monitored by the Secret Service standing outside the door. The illness "caught" like a baseball, like a fish, like blame.*

hollywood politics one and the game argues; should we say we have it here or would we flying colors...

*Hollywood and politics as one game—the Reagan trajectory, the Trump show, the celebrity as politician as celebrity. Should we admit the virus is here, in Los Angeles, or lie with flying colors? To pass with flying colors, or to fly the flag, to wave the banner of denial.*

no escape that was a title no exit...

*"No Escape," the 1994 Ray Liotta film, or "No Exit" (Huis Clos), Sartre's one-act where hell is other people locked in a room forever. No exit from Los Angeles, from fame, from the body of the public figure who cannot even shit in private.*

still, wondering where he might be, he settled in to view the referred to korean drama -

*The Korean drama—K-drama as cultural export, South Korea's soft power penetrating American streaming queues. He settles in, wondering where he is (geographically, existentially, in the plot), Los Angeles dissolving into Seoul, the Pacific shrinking to the width of a laptop screen. Korean drama: the 16-episode arc, the chaebols and the poor girls, the romantic rectangles, the product placement, the inevitable Noble Idiocy trope, the tragic backstories involving orphanages and dead mothers.*

sweetly fleshed out a character to be executed by possession truck voodoo...

*The character sweetly developed—likable, three-dimensional, given quirks and a tragic past—then executed by "possession truck voodoo." (The "truck of doom" or "truck of death": a K-drama cliché where a major character is suddenly killed by being hit by a vehicle, often a truck, appearing from nowhere just when happiness seems possible. The trope has become so ubiquitous it's memed and parodied. The truck is possessed—driven by fate, by plot necessity, by the writers' need to manufacture tragedy. It's voodoo because it's magical thinking, narrative witchcraft: the character must die, so the truck materializes. The truck is the Voodoo doll of Korean screenwriting, the pin stuck through the script, the curse that cannot be lifted because the drama needs its emotional climax and the actor's contract is ending.)*

*Voodoo itself—Haitian Vodou, the loa riding the possessed, Baron Samedi at the crossroads, Papa Legba opening the gates. But here, after voodoo, comes witchcraft—the European strain, the bruja and the witch's sabbath, the spell and the familiar. Witchcraft as control system: the writer mentions the witch throughout, the woman who holds his erections hostage, who commands his desire. This is not metaphor—this is the belief system of the obsessed, the logic of the addicted. She has hexed him. He cannot perform without summoning her image. This is love or curse, the line dissolved.*

but here is the point, as good yes except i saw it coming half a mile away that journey to get the next episode with viewers more invested...

*The critique embedded in the watching: good craft, yes, but predictable. The truck was visible half a mile down the road (literal and metaphorical). The journey to the next episode—Netflix autoplay, the algorithm feeding addiction, viewers more invested than stockholders, emotional equity accumulating.*

a plot trick twist, not to critic only to create an understanding of him his writing against technique...

*He explains: not criticism for its own sake, but to illuminate his method—writing AGAINST technique, against the Korean drama's inevitable truck, against the plot machinery. His prose is the anti-truck, the swerve, the refusal to execute the character on schedule.*

it works and always will but how many soap operas can one stand to see?

*The soap opera as form—endless, regenerating, the characters resurrected season after season, the amnesia and the evil twin and the who-shot-JR. How many? The question is existential. How many Korean dramas? How many presidential scandals? How many times can the witch possess him before the possession is just routine?*

boy meets girl, girl goes to coachella.

*The plot reduced to its essence. Coachella—the music festival in Indio, California, 127 miles east of Los Angeles in the Colorado Desert. Once a music event, now an Instagram event. Coachella is no longer known for its lineup but for its aesthetic: flower crowns, fringe, influencers in the VIP section, celebrities in branded tents. Coachella is where music goes to become content, where girl goes to become image. The festival as pilgrimage site, but the god being worshipped is visibility. Boy meets girl; girl goes to Coachella; girl becomes photograph; boy becomes obsolete.*

he had beans poetry rice platter recently which dulls the sense of hummingbird humour here for in fact stillness always beauty stays like a witch or goddess that is to say, poems mostly require a restraint opposite to this freewheel spin which for some nose stuffed reason a few rally out of context -

*Beans, poetry, rice—Korean food, the banchan and the bap, or just poverty cuisine, the diet of the broke writer. The platter dulls the hummingbird humor—the rapid-fire jokes slow down, the metabolism of wit crashes. Stillness as beauty: the witch or goddess (same category) frozen in iconography. The witch stays. The goddess stays. The girl goes to Coachella and disappears into the feed. Poems require restraint—the opposite of this freewheel spin, this chapter-long run-on sentence. "Nose stuffed reason"—congestion as explanation, the cold that clouds thought, or the coke-stuffed nose, the reason inhaled.*

contessa he wrote no contest who could argue or justify anything against the raging mob of idiocy...

*Contessa—Italian nobility, or the feminine of conte (count), or just the word he wrote meaning "no contest," nolo contendere, the plea that admits no guilt but accepts punishment. Who could argue against the mob? The mob is always right by virtue of volume. The mob on Twitter, the mob in the K-drama comment section, the mob of voters who elect the president whose prostate becomes public.*

as they shut down groovy parts of the world, he smiled what a plan...of course we might have done as much when pollution got out of control still with going out of business souls by the hundreds well there will be plenty of room to save the planet...

*The shutdowns—COVID lockdowns closing cities. "Groovy parts": Haight-Ashbury, Greenwich Village, Los Angeles, Seoul, all the groovy parts sealed. "What a plan"—the conspiracy or the pragmatism. The writer as eco-fascist, or eco-realist: pollution solved by pandemic, population control via virus, "going out of business souls"—liquidation sale on human life. The planet saved by depopulation, the Thanos logic, the utilitarian calculus.*

but first coffee, no wait he meant to call in option leather for the presidents jacket had been compromised we all surmised after australian doctor trump...

*Coffee first, always, but wait—business interrupts. The president's leather jacket compromised (stained? bugged? worn by someone else?). "Australian doctor trump"—Trump's doctor, Harold Bornstein, or Ronny Jackson, or some Australian physician, or "trump" as verb (to surpass, to fabricate). The president's body as contested site: his height, his weight, his cognitive test (person woman man camera TV). The jacket as synecdoche—the president is his wardrobe, the office is the costume.*

worst agent ever, always with defection in his dream of samara yet it did so look alike his be hookers farm the punks sold cold now nothing to hold therein does the math a few suvs and mirror of whatever goes at it jelly with castration attempt well my husband is flying in from costa rica at ten tonight...

*The worst agent—CIA, literary agent, real estate agent, all incompetent. "Defection in his dream of Samara"—Samara (the girl from The Ring crawling from the TV, or Samara, Russia, or just the dream of defection, of escape, of switching sides). "His be hookers farm"—possessive pronoun chaos, the farm of hookers he owns or wants to be. Russia enters here: the prostitutes of Moscow, St. Petersburg, the sex workers in the hotel bars, the FSB honeypots, the kompromat tapes. Russian prostitution as statecraft, as intelligence gathering. The president (any president, every president) with hookers in the Moscow Ritz, the alleged pee tape, the blackmail that may or may not exist. "The punks sold cold"—punk rock commodified, or punks (young men, rent boys) sold into cold climates, Russian winters. "Nothing to hold"—no leverage, no evidence, no body to embrace. "Does the math"—calculates the cost, the risk, the payout. SUVs and mirrors and jelly and castration—the fever dream of espionage. "My husband is flying in from Costa Rica at ten tonight"—the wife's alibi, the husband's arrival, the deadline that ends the affair, the plane landing as countdown.*

as if he could give a flying fuck over overt lying bully types!

*The writer's disgust synthesized. Flying fuck—the Americanism for total indifference. Overt lying bully types: Trump, Putin, any president, any leader, the high-profile types who started this chapter. The public figure as bully, the president as liar, and the writer—in Los Angeles, watching Korean drama, thinking about witchcraft and hookers and trucks possessed by voodoo—gives no flying fuck. Or gives one, just one, thrown like a Frisbee, like a fuck frisbeed across the Pacific from LA to Seoul to Moscow, landing nowhere, mattering not at all.*
