# Chapter Twenty

we are, after all, professionals -

There was a plan, not exactly a master plan but a vague outline.

The writer positioned himself to dedicate his future efforts to editing. Example, Whitman.

If only Pound could tell him straight what the terms of his deal with old Walt were...

*Trade winds between leaves—Whitman breath, Pound scalpel.*

Well, first things thirst; an attempt to punctuate and period the work in progress for the sake of the slow witted or soaked in chemicals - them that might stumble upon these scribblings...

It was contrary to his Plathian quest of the piston in motion - no allusion to Detroit - and yet it would save himself or an editor a few rounds of runaround -

*Motion, then incision. Engine, then suture.*

Of course, to record the lines of now at this juncture knowing how uneven it would or will be even for his ardent readers dear because the present is only so presented via his wife or muse yet red white instead of worship yearned, turned out a glance at the critical point in modern history which he wished had been wroted down slash up about the time the other indians were exterminated into reservation hotel - Roach is the last bit of a marijuana joint and also the family familay insect and this latter type has or had once upon a time its own lodge where according to the ad to segue from the other chapter they would check in and never check out - casino exceptions noted.

There is writing of that history, but it is none of it naked or even bikini as there was hardly free verse much less a beatnik chorus.

*History prefers uniforms; poetry prefers skin.*

Check it out - True stories - two stories - as the planet spun its spin at the Ides of March the hindus took to drinking moo cow pee as a means of natural cure or some type of darkening magic if you consider as he had that urine does have certain properties and yet to say such a thing well most of us stuck to the tea...Secondly, of all things pork butt was sold out at at least one retail provider of such an item! Yes an exclammation mark, wouldn't you? Followed by a question mark, nowadays they use the ask me anything gimmick -

He had decided to only engage in self interviews...

There were reports that the greediest among the species stocked up on selected supplies only to put said options up for sale at hundreds of dollars in the mark up range. 

A pack of toilet paper, sure, five hundred dollars.

Fights broke out and ambulances arrived at the battle call. 

In any case to escape this runaround, there was the matter of style. check, two a gain in profit to be able to afford as much Kleenex as he might require. 

Oh sweet Kimberly hyphen Clark - 

People only drink body fluid in moments of extreme passion or perhaps certain types of porn (oh how he hated the pee in the mouth hurling indeed as much as he loved the Chinese girls peeing in their no seat squat well anyway) and if they think the end is nigh.

Although he can look back with satisfaction now at the time he was concerned over an outflow of information and he wondered if the caste system creatures had been tipped off...

Beyond that, he pondered, if true and so, how to eliminate that segment of the species regardless of profit. 

Don't get him wrong, it was always africa he was after, but since none of the parties could agree - some of them too busy employing their own type of modern slave techniques on that continent - well India and Pakistan would have to suffice. 

Yeah, not even the argument over the greater variety of wildlife on the dark continent could rally a unification in vision. 

Five eyes all looking at different Paul Delvaux paintings...

He consoled himself with the slippery fact that there might be time yet to bull dozer the place with full a blown ebola breeze.

Look, we have the satellites, why the hell not use them? 

Always an excuse...

*Remote control morality—orbital decisions, terrestrial graves.*

On the other hand, meaning left, his erections suffered more and more as the days passed whenever he strayed from the witch and so the witch had become prelude to any attraction involving a blood filled boner. 

Damn, he was a good writer, but to have to deal with that detail well it was like not being able to paragraph without her passion.

Some spell! 

Still he braved on, half erect inside ms goo avower with the spirit of the witchcraft holding the full throttle until it was for the witch -

Even his wife folded up her leg and heeled herself during a few minutes of extra horny for his hump and then the cuddle slump.

Yes the fact is not even Elsa could take it and took to Swedish pancakes right there on the cast iron skillet.

If not the heat then we eat! 

Another exclammation period point, not only for the clever turn but also the fact that dream women were at long last in his dreams -

His dreams were a favorite subject of his writing overtly or in clandestine inserts of course when folks are losing it over the end of the world (also a U2 song or even REM if you are "older" or by some miracle listen to AM radio) dreams tend to fade out quicker overtaken by the "current" or often times in his case the throbbing erection at the thought of the witch which turned without mercy to a  drip from some diminished reservoir when he happened to long for other women.

There must be some way out of here, he thought along the the lines of all along the witchtower...

Moreover, this book itself was only him practicing the notes of his profession as the novel of record - he insisted - had to be the book of the great art which had started under another title at an earlier, perhaps too early a time. 

Of course that examination probe was into his own inner space and the desire and love of others prevented him from pouring the words required but now to have written a gen - don't say it, don't speak itn't fucking jinx it, oh sighs yes to have written or wroted from the blood already printed well it was possibly the liberation he needed to go into endgame, his own that is to clarify. 

Orgy of death, even the recently graduated angela despaired while maintaining a sense of fashion -

Yes, Angela, he rushed to whisper to her on the inconsistent transmisison of spirituality from a German film he had envisioned yes, everybody dies, momma and poppa too and me and you yet not before the end to be lightly casual over such intense matters.

Shot out of a cannon the raming remains of Hunter ese Thompson go gonzo -

The gondolas really cost too much that year ...

He sat on the dogana's steps, gonads rattled by Anyelina that jizz in the pants squirt -

He could sense something of her within, a hunger and yet how to tell?

Upon his lawyers advice, having drawn up the paper work, he proceeded to coordinate the wedding with miss goo avower previously known as little knife necklace -

Do you, Goo Avower, take this hard on made erect by witch to have and to hold when the spell weakens or otherwise wisdom in flaccid or in function in coffee frenzy and in insomnia till koreans do you part?

Mule appears with daddy mule to protest,

and it would be a kind gesture to dedicate this book to my daughter -

pay the ticket - take the ride -

nothing to fake, like a good meal he had only ate at eight without thought to any specific TO...

further song lyrics crowded his thoughts and clouded his response shrouded in well it sounds like a possible good idea but as I have ever always maintained dedication is a serious confession of truth and faith and it's not the fat that stops me or the recent exhibitinism  or pill popping episodes because my affection is unwavering no it's that it needs to be right for her and myself as a published author ahem 

he clears his thought throat in the new age of virus panic disco definition vision by golly I'm a professional ! three times over plus punctuation. 

professionals, we are after all.
