# Chapter Twenty-One

Given the fact, well the elusive fact since truth is subjective, that Faviola might still have been involved with her husband and that his tattoo was temporary even if the made in Germany marker claimed permanent - he proceeded with the divorce and new marriage...

Of course every action reflects itself in some zoo sort of reaction even stillness...

You caint do this no you caint do it i mean the interplay with scarlet was so darn cute - cut cut - and you realize now there is next to no chance of getting FM airplay -

he weighed, setly, marilyn manson got me covered - it would be all right.

that night the fight reclected itself back in his lost room's home where he found himself purr pouring a pepsi cola for a pregnant woman, but familay family kept getting in the way a few yards from touchdown the grass moist with expectations and the thrown in the face leave me alone mix as he resettled for a second take while galvan waited he was tackled memories of engleberts mothers nails clawing at his underarms clogged his nose somehow until the whole struggle awoke him -

*The dream as replay, the room lost then found, moist grass of sleep.*

it was i am sorry misses walker a girl, quad lyric phrenic boy, who what where when and why whims out the window you know now how it is on sundays after saturday night special shoots his you know who on me...

inka went into the ocean while another witch he could not divorce for being dedicated muse spoke of colours...

ours aint to reason why or cry hours to do or die, 

he thought yeah but i still enjoy flooring it that proverbial pedal to metal...

the meal vanished, two episodes to ending of the curse, eight so good and that pinkie twisted death brought him all the way back to his black mother magic woman memory press finger hold pain lesson regained devil as law,

yet, before we yay, how to keep a promise or seven perfectly as one seeps into the aforementioned soil of only one?

what kind of marriage would that be, mailer i perhaps have over stated told him the writer is very much like the actor...

hmm, given the circumstances well as long as the word polygamy doesnt newspaper -

suspected schizophrenic, visual borderline pedophile rock star, and unrepentant polygamist writer with ties to the underworld and amature propaganda distributor of unkown spy agencies has reportedly married in  secret at a gas station in london where despite the obvious danger he chain smoked in an attempt to fog the ceremony from at least two witches from his satanic coven...

barking news, once they write it up, there is no breaking out.

At this point in our tale, it is safe to say that at least Putin will be in power another sixteen years or as the Russians call it "forever".

One  could hardly ask for a greater wedding gift.  2033 said the word count of the chapter as he typed.

Stability. such an important element...Despite the obvious too much tits and hips he had wanted it for hannah montana - 

who knows, perhaps it was the horse...

whatever, the sold world was riding overpopulation and pollution's extreme and stability in the form of a plague could help both counts.

now then his medical license granted him access to the secret instructions courriered to selected hospitals and clinics...

he had gone to an imaginary medical school yet how does one go against a printed diploma and a white suit? 

mostly he massaged society women in his free time without ever thinking higher ups would take him seriously...

yet, there it was, along with several boxes of testing kits and pamphlets all seemingly long ago prepared for mass extetmination...

dear md, the following form will be returned to us at our utah facility without being seen by the patient. the nurse, however, we allow at your discretion - please note all symptoms are required except in obvious cases --- simply mark in the check point of the elected individual, couple, or family (perhaps you are familiar with the declassified sections of the guidebook red white if so familay haha). we thank you for your cooperation in maintaining a strict record of these eliminations on our way to survival in the  14-23-15. regards, V.

He wanted to write back that hey man he was the writer but the envelope clearly stated exterminate contents with careful prejudice.

knowing the gravitas of certain orders even his own cotton candy on it all, he burned the letter and practiced his diagnostic approach.

it zeems you arr a little congested, mark the bitch down on the mailing card no need to pull out a new kit - 

a runny nose, oh but she always pay right up once with a blow job type of thing not in the classified section...

how long on government relief, aha quarantine with lethal injection i mean of course anti bacterial solution...

Now, nurse, don't forget to give out green star card to our regulars and replace them white card star after a few weeks -

cards were checked at selected stations across the city where guards could on their own hand out new ones or less so a family familay of four might only have two cards -

*Documents determining breath; cards as rations of existence.*

really a wet dream for control freak institutions everywhere...

## Epilogue: On Nocturnal Emissions

The phrase "wet dream" appears here not as punchline but as physiological fact, the body's overflow mechanism—seminal vesicles emptying during REM sleep when arousal peaks and voluntary control dissolves. Nocturnal emission, clinically termed, occurs in approximately 83% of men at some point in their lives, typically beginning in adolescence and continuing intermittently through adulthood, frequency varying with sexual activity and testosterone levels.

What remains largely unspoken, relegated to whispers and medical footnotes, is that women experience analogous phenomena. Nocturnal orgasms—sleep orgasms, "dreamgasms" in colloquial parlance—occur in approximately 37% to 85% of women depending on the study, involving genital engorgement, vaginal lubrication, rhythmic pelvic contractions, and subjective reports of orgasm upon waking. The physiological mechanisms mirror male emissions: REM sleep increases blood flow to genital tissues; dream content (not always overtly sexual) can trigger arousal; the absence of conscious inhibition allows the autonomic nervous system to complete the orgasmic reflex arc.

Research by Kinsey (1953), Wells (1986), and more recent studies using sleep laboratory monitoring confirm these events occur across genders, yet cultural discourse frames nocturnal emission as exclusively male—a linguistic erasure that renders female sexual autonomy, even in sleep, invisible. The body, regardless of gender, rehearses desire in dreams, discharges tension, maintains vasculature, tests the plumbing.

In this chapter, "wet dream" functions as metaphor—control fantasies of institutions, erotic power of bureaucracy—but also as reminder: the body subverts control even in sleep. The witch may hold his erections hostage while waking, but in dreams, emission occurs without permission, without narrative, without her. The involuntary is the ungovernable.

And so the pregnant woman in the dream, the Pepsi poured, the grass moist with expectation—the chapter circles back to its opening: he awoke. The dream ended. The emission, if it happened, happened outside the text, in the body reading this, in the physiology of sleep shared by all mammals capable of dreaming. The wet dream is democratic. The wet dream is equal opportunity. The wet dream is one thing institutions cannot ration with color-coded cards.
