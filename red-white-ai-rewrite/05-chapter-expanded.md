# Chapter Five: The Square-Faced Alien and Other Transmissions

*An AI-expanded version preserving the finely tuned weirdness*

---

Near or next to those days, it had to have been for he retained some vague memory of that squared faced alien from his dream which at the time he started to juxtapose with the now dead Kirk Douglas...

The temporal displacement was getting worse. "Near or next to those days" suggested a mind losing its grip on chronology, on the basic architecture of memory that kept experience organized. The squared-faced alien had emerged from sleep like a geometric nightmare, all hard angles and impossible symmetries, bearing an uncomfortable resemblance to Kirk Douglas in his prime—that particular brand of American masculinity carved from granite and determination. But Douglas was dead now, his death another marker in the endless parade of endings that defined contemporary existence.

The alien's face haunted him not because it was otherworldly, but because it was so recognizably earthly, so specifically Hollywood. As if his subconscious could only process the extraterrestrial through the lens of the entertainment industry, as if even his dreams had been colonized by the image-makers.

Like the Rabbi in days of old, these aliens knew more than we common folk could imagine...

The comparison revealed his relationship to the unknown—not scientific curiosity but religious awe tinged with suspicion. Rabbis as keepers of esoteric knowledge, aliens as their cosmic equivalent, both possessing wisdom too dangerous or complex for ordinary minds to handle. The spelling error ("comon" instead of "common") suggested haste, urgency, thoughts moving faster than fingers could capture them.

If one was wise enough well one might pick up hints might have picked up collected hints from the entertainment franchises which had gone through the looking glass as it were...

The grammar fractured under the weight of revelation, clauses piling up like debris after an explosion. Entertainment franchises as delivery systems for hidden truth, science fiction as documentary, popular culture as encrypted intelligence. "Through the looking glass"—Carroll's phrase twisted to suggest not whimsy but genuine dimensional breach, reality inverted until fiction became fact and fact became increasingly fictional.

Inter galactic album covers, de classified materials, and subtle hints dropped from those in a position to perhaps know...

The typo ("a;bum" instead of "album") suggested neural misfiring, synapses sparking in unexpected directions. Album covers as star maps, declassified documents as breadcrumbs, insider knowledge distributed through channels designed to look like entertainment. Those "in a position to know"—government officials, entertainment executives, alien collaborators?—dropping hints with the casualness of someone commenting on the weather.

It is easy enough to imagine, of course, but some things are too terrible to be true... Kafka knew, sure he did and tried to burn the future he had written in report language before his time was done...

Kafka as prophet rather than absurdist, his nightmares not metaphorical but literally prophetic. The attempt to burn his manuscripts transformed from artistic anxiety into cosmic responsibility—the knowledge that some futures should never be written into existence. "Report language"—bureaucratic prose as incantation, administrative documents as spells that conjure the realities they describe.

Undone, all our books are published in heaven copyright held in the nine circles of hell...

Dante's cosmology collapsed into modern intellectual property law, creativity subject to both divine inspiration and demonic ownership. The vertical axis of medieval theology become a corporate hierarchy, with writers as indentured servants to forces they could neither see nor comprehend. Heaven as publisher, Hell as legal department—a contemporary theology that explained why good books so often emerged from suffering.

He borrows from the all in but this being wsb day well you caint fake it, daddy long legs...

William S. Burroughs Day—February 5th, his birthday—when the influence of the master cut-up artist became impossible to ignore or resist. "Daddy Long Legs" not the spider or the children's story but Burroughs himself, reaching across time and space with extended limbs to manipulate reality through word-virus techniques. "Caint fake it"—authentic weirdness required genuine madness, couldn't be manufactured or simulated.

Shakes itself, singing text wroted through the whisper of cemetery minds...

The text achieving independent existence, self-generating, self-modifying, "wroted" through voices of the dead who had learned to speak in frequencies only the living could barely detect. Cemetery minds—not the decomposed brains of corpses but the collective unconscious of all who had passed beyond, still transmitting on wavelengths that required special sensitivity to receive.

Buried in the encryption burning if not typed...

Information as fire, consuming itself if not given material form through typing. Encryption both protection and prison, meaning locked away even from its creator unless translated through the mechanical act of keystroke and screen-glow. The urgency of transcription before the vision burned away like morning mist.

Earning the ticket somehow, most likely through lust—

The golden ticket to whatever ride this was becoming, admission earned not through virtue or wisdom but through base desire. Lust as currency in transactions with forces that demanded payment in corrupted innocence, in the surrender of whatever purity might have remained.

Lickety split suddenly he felt he could jollify...

The archaic verb emerging unbidden—to jollify, to make merry, to transform sorrow into celebration through sheer linguistic force. The speed of the transformation ("lickety split") suggested either manic episode or authentic transcendence, consciousness shifting gears without warning.

They will be jelly, well let them eat cake...

Marie Antoinette's famous last words (though she never actually said them) twisted through contemporary slang—"jelly" meaning jealous, but also suggesting the physical consistency of envy, something wobbly and insubstantial. The royal dismissal of popular hunger applied to creative success, the artist's fantasy of making others jealous through his achievements.

Like if not lust then having irked a power holding friend into requesting admittance so as not to have to deal with the writer's woe for a while...

The alternative path to transcendence—not through personal corruption but through annoying someone important enough to have you removed from ordinary reality simply to get you out of their hair. "Writer's woe" as occupational hazard so tedious that powerful friends would arrange supernatural intervention just for peace and quiet.

The clancy brothers kick bob dylan out of the pup...

Historical incident becoming mythological template—Dylan's early folk scene rejection, traditional Irish musicians showing the door to the future of American music. "The pup" reducing sacred venues to diminutives, making legends petty, showing how the revolutionary is always first ejected by the establishment it will eventually replace.

Miles from anywhere he had ever been, sliding door space ship trace of hip uniform jumpsuit he couldn't say exactly it was not meant to be remembered for even the day did everything to keep him at a distance from his thoughts, but like google had once upon hounded him, well it was the brain that would not die... that afternoon.

The abduction narrative filtered through contemporary paranoia, sliding doors replacing traditional beaming technology, hip uniforms suggesting aliens who'd studied human fashion but missed some essential element. Memory suppression as intentional design feature, the day itself conspiring to prevent coherent recollection. Google as previous hunter, search algorithms having stalked him before aliens took over the job. "The brain that would not die"—1950s B-movie title describing his own consciousness, too stubborn to succumb to prescribed amnesia.

The large company corporation monopoly places do these things and the crowd sits there agape as gina tattooed herself well how the heck did they know this or that...

Corporate surveillance normalized to the point of public spectacle, privacy violations as entertainment, the crowd "agape" both shocked and mouth-breathing stupid. Gina—identity unknown but actions specific—tattooing herself while somehow corporate entities demonstrated impossible knowledge of personal details. The fragmented syntax suggesting information overload, too many surveillance streams to process coherently.

Answer before the question...

The fundamental breakdown of linear causality, responses preceding inquiries, effects anticipating causes. In a surveillance state sophisticated enough, questions become unnecessary because behavior patterns make answers predictable. The conversation already concluded before it began.

Inter galactic speed of light no sound transmission even the weather can turn on a dime...

Communication beyond the constraints of physics, information traveling faster than light specifically because it had abandoned sound, abandoned all physical media. Weather as mood, as metaphor, as actual atmospheric condition—all equally subject to instant reversal without warning or explanation.

Crime? not if you can pay the lawyers...

The eternal equation of justice and wealth, illegality as a luxury good available only to those who couldn't afford it. Lawyers as reality-distortion field generators, capable of transforming crime into legal precedent through sufficient application of billable hours.

It was a robotic face, a reconstruction made to have the look of inflexible authority, square as far as beatnik or beatific as pluto is from earth...

The alien's face described in terms that collapsed distance and philosophy, "square" meaning both geometric and anti-beatnik, conformist in the most literal sense. The gap between "beatific" and the alien's expression measured in astronomical units, spiritual transcendence as remote as the dwarf planet, authority achieved through deliberate elimination of anything approaching grace or spontaneity.

Third stone from the fun burn sun... honey i'm home? no, pinky there'll be nobody home...

Jimi Hendrix's "Third Stone from the Sun" corrupted through domesticity and cartoon references, cosmic perspective reduced to suburban anxiety. "Fun burn sun" suggesting both solar energy and the exhaustion that follows pleasure. The domestic call ("honey i'm home") answered by Pinky from "Pinky and the Brain," childhood cartoon wisdom announcing the essential emptiness waiting at journey's end.

Well, maybe facebook will remind you that you are possibly homeless in your own apartment but here is a one bed room barghain...

Social media algorithms achieving uncanny accuracy in identifying personal displacement, homelessness as psychological condition rather than merely economic. The misspelling "barghain" suggesting either accent or deteriorating literacy, possibly both, the cheap deal that solves nothing while creating new problems.

Barghain, that's how he talked sort of high brow brit but his lips never moved his mouth never opened and every7thing said went through telepathy...

The alien's communication style described through class markers—"high brow brit" suggesting education and superiority—but delivered through impossible means. The typo "every7thing" indicating either technological interference or consciousness fragmentation, normal spelling corrupted by otherworldly influence.

Two time zones implanted on each side of his nose yet nearly imperceptible...

Temporal displacement made visible through facial modification, time itself subject to surgical intervention. Time zones not as geographical conveniences but as actual implanted chronometers, allowing simultaneous existence in multiple temporal frameworks. The subtlety of the modification suggesting advanced technology disguised as minor cosmetic enhancement.

He turned when the writer tried to stare and then followed the bee line he directed suddenly finding himself awake at one eastern standard time....

The moment of recognition and subsequent transportation, the alien aware of being observed and responding by relocating the observer through space-time. "Bee line" as navigation method, direct path ignoring obstacles, consciousness following geometric shortest distance between two points regardless of intervening reality.
