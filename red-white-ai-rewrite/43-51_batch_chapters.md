## Chapter 43: Cruel Silence, Tokyo Dream, Contact Lenses

The night curved in a cruel silence, he lingered around himself torn in twenty directions. Hesitating at the keyboard, his attempted poetics demanding their right to remain silent just like the evening. Tears of an undistinguished teasing extinguished themselves in a vague sorrow down his right eye.

Hunger is or might be defined in various ways and this need he had suspected since the previous Friday when a faint throb of pain thrust upon his right middle finger. No cause, after the interval, it floated further right ringing the next fingers until pink and seemingly vanishing into a dream.

Where Tokyo was he? The Capital Grille manning the maned statue Olwyn leaned over, Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer with IA the VG and sister both seahorsed tattooed arms, and after the hound barked why in the dog cursed rain of Big Pine Key as Emma and Daniella held on to a white hen operative with red beak perhaps for eggs...begs the question are they the Russian bones of the last czar, comet NEOWISE now visible except where you are.

Finally a dream seeing himself asleep, chewing from going to bed hungry, wire of memory braces detach he delivers himself to bathroom only to find the last four digits and she is trying to get through a wall which he claws away at revealing two layers and they step through now steeped in streets of city where walking she tries to clean her **contact lenses** and he holds out his hand luckily as they slip from her to him a friendly fright he awakes with the glimmer of bubble blue still shining in his mind two cupcakes coffee and sleep until late evening.

## Chapter 44: Taylor at Jones Beach, Baby Witches, Belfast

Taylor at the beach that were Manhattan, he paraphrases *the boneheads blew it up*, turn to *Easy Rider* before, *we blew it*. Blue and white sure how long before it is red and white the title question.

Seeing himself divine passed out under the mescaline sun Jones Beach skin crimsoned, he thought we should all be so carefree.

The Alienist, having read the book and part of the sequel...yes, but it does not stand alone he thought as jealous bitches bit at the air of mockery.

So much politics too much poll italics not enough TikTok even as the **baby witches** make the international news arena.

Time zone impaired or dead he imagines himself in Belfast Ms. Gromley's love arm freckled in the fantasy where Emma sayeth no hen a cock and nakedness drools alongside that canine hexed downpour.

West LA fadeaway, Jesus watching Helen in soft porn pose for artist when he wanted to Glenda yet feared busting her hips.

## Chapter 45: Branch Davidians, Timothy McVeigh, Guns of Brixton

Suspected of stockpiling weapons and ammunition...that is what the history books spell out when explaining why the ATF got into a standoff with the **Branch Davidians** after trying to serve a warrant for arrest.

**Timothy of C Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Mechanized Infantry** found it so horrid that he blew a hole that killed 168 folks in the **Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building** on anniversary date in Oklahoma not the musical but if you want a track how about oh **the guns of Brixton**...

*When the law break in / How you gonna go? / Shot down on the pavement / Or waiting in death row / You can crush us / You can bruise us / But you'd have to answer to / Oh, the guns of Brixton*

McVeigh was honorably discharged in 1991 and had received the Bronze Star Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon.

Please note it is commonly dismissed with the title "Waco siege" instead of "Branch Davidian massacre".

Seventeen children killed and forty-eight assault rifles found...two point eight per child. He does not understand it, he would not think twice of having twice that number to protect his own children.

TM was executed on 11 June 2001 and denied military burial despite his previous spotless service record, yes 93 days before the "never forget" September erm, siege or massacre.

One needs to understand that patriotism is more than one thing, he sees that man as a **patriot** even within the logical condemnation of terrorism.

## Chapter 46: Mescaline Sun, Siberia Burning, India Land Grab

Did he say the mescaline sun...trimethoxyphenethylamine...like peyote cactus juice in rays...we can't have him getting high from the sun! By jings, and it rained for two days.

The sun strikes the usual chords, by ten thirty he is stoned having edited the line to hashish sun in his imagination. It crumbles over his head in tan bits and bitter dust.

Now then, they yes worldwide conspiracy easy to fact check have been engaged in constant seeding of stories hinting at power plant recording engineer era to measure reaction or maybe something more sinister.

He huffs and puffs, disappointed at a world that is willing to put up with that sort of thing while **Siberia is burning**.

The plan is in place, plain as day in red and white: the charade of the democrats can no longer be covered up otherwise we would have Hillary trying again, **India is taking up land** that could be used to ease the Chinese burden among other things, and the planet requires a very serious overhaul.

## Chapter 47: Moby Dick, Herman Melville Killed Kennedy

November 14 Moby Dick 1851. American date publication by Harpers & Brothers New York. Five thousand eight hundred and forty-five weeks previous to the mystery month in question.

*"It is not down in any map; true places never are."*

They don't call it secret service for nuthin! 6 Kislev 5724.

He rises and washes the ink from his dream, that bacon Swiss cheese burger sure was a scream, the details fade we went to the moon and we are going to Mars ah yes he remembers now, **Herman Melville (Gansevoort) killed President Kennedy**, he sighs, or the whale.

## Chapter 48: Space X, Aleksandra, Nikki Haley Drag, Holocaust Math

Dressed up in anti-laser clothing and shoes, he walked away from the neverending data pouring out of the nineteen sixties. Over thirty countries sent coal furniture, diamonds, metal squishers, and even erotic artifacts. England that year, held the great exhibition in Hyde Park.

The New York Times opened up shop, he was told by some Belgian undercover detectives as word came from the present that **Space X** had returned.

He splashes down, landing atop of Aleksandra and later thinking my oh my Dakota sure did remind him of Miss Goo Avower in the homewrecker scene season two.

Shay pulls all-nighters at the sixty room Quality Inn South Carolina he asked **Nikki Haley** even if part of him thinks she is only **John Kerry in drag**.

A headline said those kids killed Miss Majors over ten mere dollar greenbacks and that there was film of her fighting them off even biting one hand.

Imagine that exclamation point, yes work camps, they wanted production especially when the Russians dug in, even brought in whores for the men as motivation, yes the census won't add up, not in Europe, not at that time.

## Chapter 49: Population Math, Poland Numbers, Holocaust Skepticism

Notes in case of required or requested elaboration on one subject.

Twelve million, the population of Canada, which is twice the size of Europe, stood in 1945. There are claims that twenty percent of Poland vanished during the war with numbers counted from 36 million down to 25 in 1946 wherein a post-war pogrom took place somehow.

In contrast Russian numbers rose by two million despite all conflicts. Note history spells their casualty as sixteen million! If the first of these sets of numbers are factual, it would mean half of that country gone in terms of humans.

Here is where his belief in that part of history wavers. Although he understands there was an attempt to diminish certain sections of society in order to bring forth a stronger healthier world, he cannot find the truth to sing along to.

That is, if one weighs the historical line from say 1938 one finds **seven hundred and fifty thousand people would have necessarily been executed every year** until 1945 and this evaluates both start and end not on November 38 or April 45 but the entire year yes silly but not as ludicrous as counting from 1933 as some insist on doing.

**Two thousand plus persons every day...eighty-five or so every hour...**

## Chapter 50: Naked Dream, Three Infants, Bulgakov 50, T-Rex Attack

The dream catches him naked, vulnerable...She is lounging with three children...infants...Aliens from the land of childhood that can only communicate with mothers or well-versed nurses.

They sit together, his bare left foot gently perched upon her bare right foot. Her smile reminds him momentarily of Brooke or perhaps Rachel. He takes a moment to play with the babies, there are two boys and a girl.

Waiting to board the airplane with the Russian, they sit next to each other then suddenly he is thrown into a tumble of forced fumble navigated by bullies one with a plastic square next to his nose the other intent on a pissing contest yet he races back to her heart in thunder of desperate sky only to find himself in a ditch surrounded by prehistoric animals as a larger fiercer creature fills the lightning clouds with dark foreboding gloom a **Godzilla** alike in the jot notebook he recently purchased that reads scream for T-Rex and in the scene he shouts that one long shout that only knows she is a long ways away and this ancient monster is about to have him as a snack.

Fifty is where Bulgakov lived...we pause now to entertain more modern methods. Whoa wait shouldn't them last two chapters be the end of him...it seems he has developed some sort of immunity to weird hit songs, virtual democratic fundraisers, and detour stories in the press.

## Chapter 51: Shopping for Pants, IBM Towers, Fight Club, Magda's Six Children

Seemingly shopping for pants, there are stacks of slacks in large circle at the center of some store, perhaps a mall. The jeans feel like prewashed, what was that ancient phrase, hmm stone washed.

Sauntering away from the eager to please retail sales person he pauses at some point beyond finding a massive series of information gathering machines as in the elderly **IBM tower systems** all connected possibly capable of being trained on one single brain.

Awake to Aleksandra watching **Fight Club**. Subsequent to concern as IA the VG traversed herself from vacation land to home.

She traced his steps from beach to Kamakura on the **seventy-fifth anniversary of the explosion**. That was how the world used to end.

He made the connection in the bunker as **Magda put the six children to sleep**. Under the White House.

Yes, even Nixon questioned *what is the matter with the Jews, Bob*.

He believes once upon a tome or time there was a conspiracy but after 1945 another conspiracy to cover up the first has got us all baffled.

One-Eyed Lou missed the open stove for cleaning for the third time in two months. Then stormed even in turning it off that it was off. If off is on what how who when oh why **Case 39** flashes on the Fox Classics screen kid in the oven kicking and screaming.

## Editorial Notes:

**Branch Davidians / Timothy McVeigh**: The narrator frames the Waco siege as government massacre and McVeigh as patriot, defending Second Amendment rights through domestic terrorism—provocative reversal of mainstream narrative.

**Holocaust Math Skepticism (Chapters 48-49)**: The narrator questions Holocaust death toll logistics, calculating 2,000+ deaths per day, 85 per hour as implausible, expressing Holocaust denial through "just asking questions" rhetoric.

**Magda Goebbels**: Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' wife who poisoned her six children in Hitler's bunker, April 1945. Narrator invokes this as parallel to contemporary political conspiracy.

**Case 39 (2009)**: Horror film where social worker discovers foster child is demonic. One-Eyed Lou's gas stove incidents parallel the film's oven scene, suggesting demonic possession.

**Nikki Haley = John Kerry in Drag**: Transphobic conspiracy that female politicians are secretly men, common in far-right circles.

*Chapters 43-51 escalate through Branch Davidian martyrdom, Timothy McVeigh as patriot, Holocaust denial math, Magda Goebbels' child murders, One-Eyed Lou's possessed stove attempts, and the narrator's deepening Holocaust skepticism framed as intellectual inquiry.*
