# Chapter Eighteen

## Preface: The Poem as News That Stays Nude

Ezra Pound wrote that "literature is news that stays news." In Chapter Eighteen, the aphorism mutates: *poetry is news that stays nude*—unclothed fact, the raw flesh of language exposed without the editorial fig leaf. This chapter arrives in two movements: first, a prose passage that reads like a livestream of consciousness interrupted by breaking news alerts, brand names, and the ghosts of Instagram models; second, a poem crystallizing the chaos into couplets and tercets, form as emergency shelter from the storm.

*Fashion as metaphor for survival. Prada and Fendi as currency that doesn't diminish. The bell tower at the crossroads—time and choice converging. This is the chapter where the sentence breaks into the poem, where the paragraph surrenders to the line break, where prose admits it was verse all along, just wearing punctuation as a disguise.*

A bell tower and the crossroads of your miles away from his in his backyard. Backyard. sparrow jay owl cat stray climb The out all of the care about what I a self-inflicted catholic guilt judgement wound intensity of pain? 

*The senses speaking water: I am. Descartes in liquid form—"I flow, therefore I am." The Department of Shots Fired as bureaucracy, violence as paperwork. "Upon you wore"—you wore it, bore it, swore it. When Burroughs flies, he IS the wing—not on it, not piloting it, but becoming the anatomy of flight itself. Oak Bridge Parkway, real or imagined, the site where reports flow into change, change into constancy. A woman's husband dead from bee—anaphylaxis or murder by apian proxy, the mystery buzzing like tinnitus, like the hive mind. "At least one gunshot wound"—the euphemism of police reports, the bureaucratic hedge against certainty. Let this not become blood—the plea against coagulation, against hardening into fact.*

*Bitcoin as the drink, the new wine, cryptocurrency as communion. Stealing Paris and London—Napoleon, Hitler, or just a tourist with klepto tendencies. Nicky (whoever she is) ripping pages from mom's magazines—Brooke Shields, perhaps, or any Brooke, the one puff on the bell like opium, like a tolling for thee. Rachel as arrival, more space, the bedroom walls calling, alive. The Doors (Jim Morrison's band, or literal doors) during this uncontainable night—the darkness that cannot be held, only entered. Fifteen jets—a squadron, or the New York Jets in some alternate timeline. Modeling as verb and noun, I ring (engage, encircle, telephone) my cock (rooster, penis, the gun's hammer). Flow to the rushing flower—deflowering as river, menstruation as current.*

*New York and wine. Old enough to understand: the age of consent, the age of reason, the age of Instagram. When Instagram was just Explore, before the algorithm, before the influencer economy. Fashion in the big virus economy—COVID capitalism, the mini pleated skirt as asset class, Amanda's anniversary kiss as transaction. "What a fucking sound there"—the theremin of sex, the audio of arousal. Bell tower at the crossroads: choose your direction while time strikes. Sparrow jay owl cat—the avian and feline witnesses, the strays climbing out of all care. Catholic guilt as self-inflicted wound, stigmata via superego. "Well maybe now you can imagine mine"—the writer's pain offered as exchange rate.*

well maybe now you can imagine mine - he juxtaposes speaking not to girls but the ungrounded intruders not a johnson in the crowd -Pain? 

*"Not a johnson in the crowd"—no penises (johnsons), no Presidents Johnson (Lyndon or Andrew), no Samuel Johnson (the dictionary man). The ungrounded intruders—those without ground, without earth, aliens or angels or influencers floating free of context.*

If what Prada meant Fendi, items that don't diminish in value what pound said poetry is news that stays nude I located the suspect, sperm the pages to stick on Quiet magazine familay family fiends for no friend who has developed a massive passion. 

*If Prada means Fendi—if luxury brands are fungible, interchangeable, the designer label as variable in an equation. "Items that don't diminish in value"—the handbag as Bitcoin, the poem as hedge fund. Pound's dictum revised: poetry is news that stays NUDE, not news. The news disrobes, the fact exposes itself. "I located the suspect, sperm"—forensic evidence, or the suspect IS sperm, the criminal always male, always seminal. Pages stick with semen, with the glue of arousal, on Quiet magazine (a real publication, or the magazine of silence). Family becomes familay—the corpse of kinship—becomes fiends, the family as addicts, as demons. "No friend who has developed a massive passion"—passion as tumor, love as growth.*

well these posers tell each other let's pretend to be her - masked ball in bali stations of the cross empty church poet all the holy water gone and yet the ancient gods are respected while the witches are expected to just kidding row in if you know or even don't what he perfectly meant here now meet the poem of chapter eighteen:

*Posers pretending to be her—influencer culture as identity theft, Instagram as masked ball. Bali as party island and Hindu sacred ground, the stations of the cross transplanted to the tropics. Empty church, the poet alone, holy water evaporated. The ancient gods (Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma) respected while the witches are expected to—what? Expected to just kidding. The sentence breaks. "Row in"—row the boat, join the crew, or "row" as fight. "If you know or even don't"—knowledge as optional, understanding as elective. What he perfectly meant: the meaning is perfect even if incomprehensible.*

### The Poem of Chapter Eighteen

ink word work in words like wine  
*The labor of language, ink as vintage, the word as fermentation*

white sofa red love seat rose pink  
*The furniture of desire, the color spectrum from innocence to lust to aftermath*

poison tightly ropes a lament  
*Poison as bondage, the lament tied up, grief restrained by toxicity*

what he meant  
*The irreducible minimum—intention*

weight of eyes waiting  
*The gaze as gravity, vision as burden, the audience as oppression*

when steps asphalt concrete  
*When footsteps become pavement, when walking hardens into infrastructure*

indoors like the street  
*The privacy that isn't, the home as public space, surveillance as architecture*

worthless privacy  
*The devaluation of solitude, the privacy that buys nothing*

inner light stutters a flicker  
*The soul as faulty bulb, enlightenment as electrical problem*

women stitch a tattoo sea  
*Women as seamstresses of the dermis, the ocean as body art, waves as needlework*

vessel at waves he saves her  
*The boat, the body, the container—he rescues her from the waves or at the moment of waves (orgasm, grief, oscillation)*

awakes himself in foreign worry  
*The self as alarm clock, consciousness as anxiety, foreign as in unfamiliar or abroad*

a fast woe mourning black he wore  
*Fasting and speed, woe and mourning, the black suit as uniform of grief*

hardly ever practiced the story  
*The narrative unrehearsed, the tale untold, the life unlived in draft*

much less the score  
*The music even more neglected, the debt unpaid, the accounting incomplete*

up for the gin-a type  
*Ready for gin, or the vagina-type, the alcohol and the anatomy*

let down he cannot  
*Unable to disappoint, or unable to be lowered, stuck at altitude*

comment commit  
*To remark or to bind oneself, the comment as commitment, the commit as comment*

hearing a single narrative's hype  
*The propaganda of one story, the marketing of singularity*

mind thought breathing a knot  
*The mind, thought, breathing—all tangled, all tied, all impossible to untie*

yet heroin still as her crotch her tit  
*Heroin as stillness, as narcotic peace, equated with female anatomy—the breast and groin as drug*

wine like words in work word  
*The circle completes: wine returns, words return, the work is the word*

pink rose seat love crimson settee white  
*The colors reverse, the furniture rearranges, the love seat now crimson, deeper*

lament ropes burden tightly poison horde  
*Lament and ropes and burden and poison multiply—the horde of suffering*

equality he never met the fight  
*He never encountered equality in battle, or he failed to meet the fight for equality*

wanting a yes of nothing whored.  
*Desiring affirmation of void, the yes that is nothing, the nothing prostituted*

## Epilogue: The Sentence Becomes the Line

Chapter Eighteen is a hinge. The prose—that torrential, punctuation-resistant flood—condenses into verse. The sprawl contracts. The run-on becomes the couplet. 

*This is the moment when the writer admits he's been writing poetry all along, that the novel is just an excuse for lineation, that narrative is the scaffolding the poem uses to reach the rooftop and then kicks away.*

The poem itself is a mirror: it presents, then reverses. Ink/word/work becomes wine, then wine/word/work becomes ink. White sofa becomes crimson settee. The poison that ropes the lament becomes the poison horde. *The poem is a palindrome of suffering.*

"Equality he never met the fight"—this is the confession. The writer admits he's been a spectator, a voyeur, a commentator. He's watched the fight for equality from the white sofa, the rose-pink love seat, *never entering the ring*. And what does he want instead? "A yes of nothing whored"—affirmation of emptiness, the approval of void, the consent of the abyss.

*Prada and Fendi don't diminish in value. Poetry is news that stays nude. The witch controls his erections. The Instagram economy has replaced the virus economy or become it. The bell rings. The crossroads wait.*

This is the chapter where form rescues content, where the poem arrives as emergency services to the scene of the prose accident. The lament is roped tightly. The poison is a horde. The yes is nothing, and nothing is whored.

*He meant what he meant, perfectly, whether you know or don't.*
