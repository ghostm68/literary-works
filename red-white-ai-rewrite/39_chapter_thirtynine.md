# Chapter 39: Chapter Thirty-Nine

## Boko Haram, Liz Taylor, and the Daily Black Holocaust Squares

Is it to incite anger, anguish, or mob mentality?

Boko H wipes out a snitch village—nobody blinks. An elephant eats explosives but it is not a "thing."

**Intermission**: The fact, as he has learned over and over again, is that many more than a few celebrities are extremely nice, well-meaning, and willing to go the extra mile for certain causes. Example: **Liz Taylor**—yes, perhaps not the blueprint for the rest, yet a glowing example of compassion. That is to say, some of them truly intend to make the world a better place and are not in it to save their own skin in the public eye. Of course, others obviously are going through the motions or worse, trying to gain the good opinion of the crowd. They forget the crowd is crazy, a hurry over to the next craze—hoi polloi, who cares about history?

Still, the so-called stars rush to an imaginary starting gate.

Sometimes it seems like a race—perhaps the wrong word to employ—but yes, a desperate reaching for the visible impression, impact, which will what? Make heads nod in silent yesses or force the dormant criminal elements in otherwise middle-class comforts to say, *Hell yeah, it is our time to lynch.*

Of course, these tables, as the justice system betrays, have already been turned.

If memory serves, **Howard Hughes** lived through one such war and it marked him thereafter in negative terms against what were then termed Negroes...or so it seemed to him...as the dreaded word **backlash** gargled in the mouth of many already fed up with affirmative action and holier-than-thou Hollywood.

He proposes a game show with death penalty:

### THE DAILY BLACK HOLOCAUST SQUARES

No, not only niggers—spics or even Lebanese can be in the category. But how? We give them a spotlight eternal, national TV, and they can choose electric chair, hanging, lethal injection, or even vehicular manslaughter. We are not dictators.

## Autumn Graduates, Paimon, and the Witch's Speed Seed

Look here, **Autumn** graduated—it was the best part of his day. She posted a gown with a lit cigar, *like a boss*. He celebrated the occasion by not only liking the picture but also many of the comments. *Link in bio* is not actually...*link in HTML* is more like it.

Oh, to get away from butchering the world and back to poetry. It is there, he has felt it—with every thought of her, a line or start.

Digress with callback: obviously he can't figure out how that could happen in heaven—i.e., rebellion by the beau-ideal angel—yet in a similar conundrum, what sense would it make to petition a demon in place of common prayer? Sure, the anxious types, yet the position stands on its own, no?

A disturbance in the force field, uneven sky. He awoke with the name **Paimon** resounding. Not expecting guests, he tried to fix similarities: *pay moan*, et al. He recalled fictional horse *pie oh my*.

He pondered without resolution as **Clapton** wondered who else he could kill to escape the grasp of odd ailments. It had been some years since Bruce, but Baker's death did not offer the same extension. Two-thirds of **Cream** ready gone. Aha, like his testicle fluid that long hot day.

There was a guest—the witch calmly telling him she had not cheated, merely selected one of her many boy vessels to carry his speed seed into her. *Pain moi*, prolly a French fry. He sighed without the collective exhaling.

Is that what it is? What it was? He did not doubt it, but by jings, what a gyp—oh wait, is that racist? Quick, play some Gypsy Kings...oh oh oh, volare.

## William Steele Sessions, Kobe Lookalike, and Bachelor Bait

Reports were out before he awoke: **William Steele Sessions** dead. Not known to dress in drag officially—the transgender battle was rising. Someone had, it seemed to him, placed a wager...over what and how much was not certain, not to him. But the much-talked-about *Bachelor* from the once cool ABC had cast a COVID—he means mean—**Kobe lookalike** as the lead.

Give the widow something to stroke to in the evenings.

With Americans and especially American intelligence, one could not be certain of the plan. It was a usual bait-and-switch move by now to plant a similar face in a viewable space.

*He will be so loved, everyone will be getting Bryant spasms.*

She will either shoot the TV or run down to Mexico for a hot taco orgy. Sometimes something has to give.

**Is your vibrator depressing you? Tired of having to hold it with your hands?** Come to Red Lion Inns where our beds feature multiple satisfaction devices mounted right in the middle of each mattress.

## True Blood, Ikea Mirror, and Cold Fish

Birds chirp. He dreamt downloading a set of images, very postmodern internet scene—sort of like his Adobe Air to deploy once upon a time website for offline viewing. The pictures in a blur, then some sort of flashback into *True Blood*.

He had cut his left hand middle finger on a shard of mirror—damned **Ikea** was still getting kicks in on the sly. The Dutch girl erased all thoughts of Sam Merlotte and his concern over daughters and lovers, and then as the semen started to speak, Autumn smiled, for she knew also that he could not be certain if it was IA the VG or Eeline or even the poodle.

Meanwhile **Lizzy** made him look at sushi as if to say, *It is not all about tofu.*

Later, he reflected: *cold fish*. Had she seen it? Unsure of how the day would turn out, he typed his scene and as he did, *Shaved Fish* came to mind, which was a record with interesting art.

## Lennon, Miles Davis, and Chapman's Fast

**Lennon** once mentioned he had the self-same feeling with Yoko as he had had with Paul. In one video he placed several people—one of them **Miles Davis**—it seemed to him the seed that led on that awful day in December.

Nobody might agree, yet the jazzy cat was shot ten years right before that song was recorded—79, 69—making in his view the retroactive mix-up more than possible. He needs to fact-check the dates on this theory.

**\*\*\*The video was pulled from the *Imagine* film (recorded 71, released December 72). Note: Lennon shot 80, Chapman tried, sentenced, jailed 81, and went on a 26-day fast in 82. He has had ten parole reviews—the eleventh due in August of 2020.**

He wants to write a premonition, but there was too much yelling and some noise in the hours before he finally regained himself to settle into sleep, yet he senses something is about to happen, to give. Hopefully it will be nothing more than love, yet he would settle for music.

What was playing then? 2010, airplane crashes and a couple of volcanoes as Mailer and I finished off **JD Salinger**.

**Peter Steele** too—*Rap music is bad poetry by folks that cannot sing*—he forgot to mention, in some cases, play an instrument. **William Steele Sessions**...hmm. Well, part of that song plays on a UFO sighting of one night at nine in the evening on Friday, 23 August 1974. Note: only officially released in 1984.

The data swirls. He shits, showers, shaves. Something is there but his instinct is clouded. Perhaps he should only be expecting rain.

## Misbehaviour, Hannah Arendt, and Judenrat

He was not expecting a master class in **show do not tell**, yet there it was in *Misbehaviour*. Double K, prolly his favorite movie—*London Boulevard* for that shopping sequence.

It was Sunday. **Yemen** rising in social media, the burned-down Wendy's hushed—perhaps because you can only revolution so much before pausing to fill in the blank. Imaginary arguments swirled to his surprise as if anxious for release, and then there was **Hannah Arendt**.

*Nazi whore*, read the note. She had only pointed out the **Judenrat** aspect while revealing **Eichmann** to be a mediocre man following orders.

He breathed deeply knowing the Jews were ahead of him with deportation news already in place before he awoke. But it is like she said: *You spent this mob money on four plane tickets just to get a girl message.* Something is true and they cannot face that fact.

Of course, looking at the display of wounds at the trial of one man as if he were the entire Reich sums up the delusion. Or: *Yes, you have a point, but don't deny it is a dictatorship sailing right over drowning Palestinians.*

In later waves, Lauren wore camouflage, yet the imaginary arguments pressed on in spirit as if drama itself was determined to present conflict.

## Hijo de Pai y Mai, Devil's Greatest Trick, and Rory Gallagher

Plastic dream. Back in triple K, the narrow kitchen, an English-style pack of smokes, possibly labeled **Ammon** in silver letters. Six in the morning—he is her, and although some thought it was *Coyote*, it turned out to be *Here*, this tome work in progress.

She would have loved all this thinking, thought, speaking—*speak to me spic in your Spicorama*.

Oh yes, PS: they have this saying, **"hijo de pai y mai"**—perhaps a disguised, even to themselves, invocation of that fallen angel, sure not as popular as *hijo de puta*, yet possibly worth the note.

As is film quote: **"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist."**

Some ideas arrive so timely it is tempting to categorize them as proof. He sure could deposit a theory downgrading the religious to misuse the word story or stories, and yet there is that awful slippery proof, not to mention his own upbringing.

A question of perhaps equal weight in the worry of right and wrong: **Why isn't Rory Gallagher a real rock star?** All the makings and a good enough voice. Hmm, he looked—wow, sound yeah, but a bit too much somehow, as if preprogrammed, and then the similarity to **Jimmy Page**—well, **Led Zep** was well ahead, you would say. Song writing like **Billy Squier** briefly learned, but he could also not be Zeppelin. *Highlander*—only one.

All this made him feel pretty excellent over his casual attitude over practice and playing. He knew it before: top priority, you could have it all and yet be overlooked. Sure, he too was somewhat overlooked, but it was a different time and certain songs would rock even if not listened to.

He listened to Bowie and it stayed with him a while, as Autumn had earlier that day. Certain songs simply kept getting better with time.

He traded stocks and prepared to watch double K in *Anna Karenina* as an American with several citizenship credentials was sentenced for spying in Russia.

Idaho or Jordan, that dream...these tears weighing the answer before the question. Eighteen months is all one of the killers will get given his age—rage still, he reminds himself, technically a child...yet to have to repeat it anywhere, especially to someone that loved her. One of them got near two years detention—is like sticking another knife at her side.

## Poem: Dog Eating Baby

*dog eating baby  
no longer a handsome hound  
symptoms of a no knock warrant  
fourniere's gangrene penis  
one news item over the line  
yet is it self injected or administered  
left harlot's ghost at gonorrhoea  
statues later attacked  
herself skin and bone  
seasoned meat in freezer  
parisians pointing to a dead zone episode  
narrowing pain to neighbor or uncle anagram  
she knew intimate heidegger and quoted kant  
imagine intellect before cable television coup  
the state a sickness if one speaks  
everyday a stage is pulled out  
no director or prop visible seen  
every night death in a shout  
no ear to listen be you slave or queen  
bijou beaujolais blow job belarus  
flash drive spy blues  
rory gallagher no muse  
a comic went by that name those shoes  
no don rickles you understand  
something other or else to command  
commended we recommended a hand  
after summer the touch of autumn  
ought haute so hot ninety fahrenheit sum  
degree in biting master lips hum  
we only used to fear blindness  
in the so called good ol days of mess  
hall capone door ness  
catholic church box confess  
glove spar of prayers unsaid  
in strange hats the demon bed  
blackstar warning twenty six teen  
took us three years in between  
bowie the great i am  
cannot take a bow or jam  
damn*

## Editorial Notes:

**Daily Black Holocaust Squares**: Game show proposal where minorities choose their execution method on live TV, framed as "freedom of choice"—a satirical inversion of victim agency.

**Paimon**: One of the Kings of Hell in demonology, commanding 200 legions. Often depicted riding a dromedary, associated with knowledge, arts, and sciences.

**Clapton and Cream Deaths**: Jack Bruce died 2014, Ginger Baker died 2019. Narrator suggests Clapton benefits from bandmates' deaths, extending his own life.

**William Steele Sessions**: FBI Director 1987-1993, fired by Bill Clinton. His death connects to transgender themes and "Steele" dossier conspiracies.

**Kobe Lookalike on The Bachelor**: Post-Kobe Bryant's death (Jan 2020), the narrator imagines casting a lookalike to sexually exploit his widow Vanessa—darkly cynical media conspiracy.

**Shaved Fish**: 1975 John Lennon compilation album with stark, minimalist cover art.

**Miles Davis UFO 1974**: Miles Davis claimed to see a UFO in 1974. The narrator links this to Lennon's assassination (1980) via "retroactive mix-up."

**Hannah Arendt / Judenrat**: Arendt's *Eichmann in Jerusalem* (1963) controversially discussed Jewish councils (Judenrat) cooperating with Nazis. She was accused of blaming victims, called "Nazi whore."

**Hijo de Pai y Mai**: Spanish wordplay—"son of father and mother" sounds like "Paimon" (demon), suggesting demonic parentage hidden in common phrases.

**Greatest Trick Quote**: From *The Usual Suspects* (1995), Verbal Kint quoting Baudelaire about the devil's invisibility.

**Rory Gallagher**: Irish blues-rock guitarist, highly respected but never achieved Led Zeppelin-level fame despite comparable talent.

**Blackstar 2016**: David Bowie's final album, released two days before his death in 2016 ("twenty six teen"). Seen as prophetic death announcement.

*Chapter 39 spirals through celebrity activism hypocrisy, demonic invocations (Paimon), Lennon assassination conspiracies, Hannah Arendt controversies, and a fragmented poem mourning Bowie while invoking Autumn, ending with the narrator's existential exhaustion: "damn."*
