# Chapter Twenty-Five

Not a soul to tell our troubles to and when it's twelve o'clock we climb the stair -we never knock for nobody there...

*"Ain't We Got Fun" (1921)—Roaring Twenties anthem, the song of economic collapse sung with a grin.*

Although, he still sensed some sort of residue fragrance which might be described like a mixture of milkdog bone biscuit and faded leather, the listerine and face lotion went a good way into masking the canine mayhem which the witch had bitched out his way.

Way oh way, no way, he thought to himself and yet unable to verbalize his agony to another, much less ms goo avower, he carried on secure in the strength that he could pretend it did not happen or in the worst case scenario call it a cigar -

*Clinton's cigar as precedent for unspeakable acts.*

That day Ms goo avower, as she had over the weekend, continued sporting a white blazer which she was certain would make her ethnicity seem a shade less white than your average toilet.

She took selfies and talked with a couple of her fans as the writer worked hard to avoid news and infiltration from others...

SHe leaned into his nearness and sighed, that - that - last night - it was -

Yes, he blushed for a moment in bliss as they kissed  until she continued,  Is that - are those hairs stuck on your cheeks?

He rubbed one side of his face nearly feeling the texture of something sliding yet holding on by means of the very cover up lotion -

At a loss for words, he blurted out nose hairs in question form -

And I could swear - what type of toothpaste is that - is that new - I could swear it was like alpo -

Alpo, what do you mean miss goo? I don't have Swiss toothpaste -

Not the alps, Alpo the dog food -

*The witch's revenge: dog on mouth, evidence on face.*

His silence told her what he could not say -

She didn't, OH MY FUCKING GOD, she declared in a sudden southern drawl rather distanced from her outskirt London talk and with a gasp added SHE DID -

He repeated, she did, I didn't even it see it coming and then she posted a picture in the hangman rider deck tarot posture reversed wearing hardly nothing and a white hat oh the inhumanity.

She embraced him then as he muttered something about understanding if she wanted to get a divorce for although cigars tasted worse to a kiss than dog chow he weighed who would want to be with me after that mutt put his pork in my mouth?

It was then the witch appeared, glowing brighter than a Russian model on her way back home after a month of foreign casting calls -

He squinted, yeah but I see it cost you a pimple right on the nose that you still have not been able to sweat out -

I will have my way with you, she communicated via telepathy -

Who? Who are you talking to? Miss Goo Avower questioned - 

You know, he said with manhattan pursed lips -

She dared to come even while we are together -

I suppose she figures we won't be together much more -

No, honey - let's not even go there, let's get clean and then you can play with me and my boots I swear sometimes I think you love my boots more than you love me -

He grinned, but then remembered, you know she has three more dogs - well four, really, but i dont think charlie can get it up no more-

Wait, are you saying you gave in to her?

No, still once in a while it's like, you know, he said now in a slower breath.

I know, but you can't let it get to you - otherwise she will pull us apart and use you as her plaything..

She pulled him into her self with a hold secure as a drum machine's beat and  beckoned him to be everything he had promised to her.

He said no words, but it was understood. A contract in the silence of matrimony.

*Marriage vows as non-verbal binding, the contract signed in silence.*

After some seconds, she stood back, shaved the regretful hairs from him with the edge of her blazers lapel and smiled, I knew  that this relationship was not going to be easy and that's not even considering those other bitches trying to turn your head around, trying to have what is mine -

Yes, miss goo avower, but I can't go back on my word or especially my dedication even for the fact of our love and the boots -

No, I get it, but there has to be what we wanted, I know I'm not as pretty as some of them or as popular but it's up to you to tell them that I am your girl.

You are - look - even without the boots - you are all the trite things people say when they they try to get poetic over a lover and being a writer I can't say them words in that order - I can only demonstrate it by being here with you entirely, wholly, fully, completely, without reservation, without lies - like all the way just like that just like this - a stupid little sun that rises only to warm you up high in the sky where all the heavens can hound me with the bark which growls look at that fool -

*The writer's love confession: I cannot use the clichés, so I become them.*

Really, you have made me the happiest woman in the world.

Hmm, you and the witch's dog.
