The law made prohibition, as in one child per - 

Fa then here major that minor quirk left the land with a lack of girl as the households gravitated to bring up robot boys -

Beijing once upon a time Peking, he sits not entirely satisfied with day or previous chapter atempt. 

The Astro Creep 2000 isp echo distraction which was preceeded by the speak to me spic in your vacant spicorama while assassination attempts slid by unseen - every moment wasted is a no return ticket to the grave -

*White Zombie's Astro-Creep: 2000 (1995), Rob Zombie's industrial metal assault.*

He raved within, not that it mattered to any one two three pin down wrestling excited commentator but the widow Zhen - he decided ardently deserved a greater effort on his part and since writing was the keenest of his triple threats well, there he was -

Typing - hopefully neither devil man nor dominican mayhem in his head breathing the nearly destroyed inspiration of thought - 

He fought, of course, she must have fought harder -

How, we know not - yet early on she was inducted into what some cliche inclined circles term the world's ol de st profession -

Flirt seen or virginity toyed with - we do not know - 

It might be like Russians with buckwheat -

The boy kneeded an operation after the embed action well before sonya left osaka for dubai connection minsk rail model home -

He wanted to have some buckwheat or better yet he wanted to fuck wet continue his honeymoon - 

Ms goo avower declared she needed two books not one if he was going to desk -

And he was going where nobody had filled in the timeline that is one day born in the Qing Empire as the nation lost its balance to heavenly opium with that plastic white smoke filling the air while invaders fractured the basic structure of the land.

True story, trusting in the stories drunkenly stated while she served in concubine capacity, her desire or perhaps let us call it lust which would have naturally revolted against thrusting penis and the like turned to sailing...tuned in to what was then a viable option which we term pirate -

*Ching Shih's origin: sold into prostitution, married pirate captain Zheng Yi, inherited his fleet upon his death, commanded 1800+ ships and 80,000 pirates.*

Somalia, possibly the last of these...Hey writer, ever notice how the darkies cannot stay away from the ocean even at the risk of drowning well something must have happened in their psyche after gunpowder trade slave travel -

So, as he was saying, she took her race to sea without mercy except for the strict rule of chopping up into pieces any one in her service that happened to force himself upon a captive- hey these are my captives hey i am the captain ho now bow low before i cut off your dumbass head for disrespecting her and so on until the entire coastal area was in shock with terror -

*Her code: death penalty for rape of captives, strict rules governing conduct. The Red Flag Fleet as disciplined military operation.*

it's like that - he will have you know without one doubt after certain illustrations, a person need only present a hint of greeting to be heard or even an envoy -

it's her and suddenly they head for the hills or hand themselves over to her mercy -

Envy not, to be feared with such feeling must leave one unable to cast a true reflection in the mirror -

it requires vanquishing any trace of one's own innocence and even what one might have been  indeed a type of blindness with even the third eye focused on the nova express phrase inflexible authority -

mirror mirror on the wall who was the baddest bitch of them all - she - shih - ching shih -

Very few have achieved it...Ghengis Khan, Alexander, Hitler...and her,

*The conquerors' pantheon: Genghis, Alexander, Hitler, Ching Shih—all architects of terror, all builders of empires on bones.*

I speculate, the term ka ching as in the cash register sound is derived from her renown.

They must have shit their pants like the Germans at the mere mention of her arrival - 

days, months, years and years her rampage went on with a fierce determination one might only translate as a redneck's relationship to duct tape -

Now then since this part of the story is fact, he leaves the narration (instead of making a major plot development as intended with a two sided play between hedy lamarr and hollywood which would have been brilliant given the boat angle - gown glow at louie bee mayer she wanted more and got it debut groovy then wifi code seed scramble signal shop lift talk show et cetera) to carry on with his mess as it were - - -

*Hedy Lamarr: 1940s film star and inventor of frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology (basis for WiFi, Bluetooth). The parallel: Ching Shih and Hedy, both beautiful, both brilliant, both underestimated.*

However, it would be a horrid thing to omit how her prowess at command and conquer could not even be defeated by imperial forces or international fighters who happened to be there in the party of this piece of china now belongs to us and we won't give our citizens this fine drug but you yellow monkeys might as well get hooked on it go ahead yes the united kingdom took hong kong until hong kong started thinking we are not chinese...

He told you China is an ongoing fight, well, this was another hundred year war...

Wear the Heston film some days in Peking to get a view from cinema - - -

*55 Days at Peking (1963), Charlton Heston in the Boxer Rebellion, Hollywood's imperial fantasy.*

As always happens, the downfall arrived - yet it came with a twist, that is to say on her terms -

There was one item of kneeling which could not be agreed upon until she pushed the envelope by dragging in seventeen women and children as the equilizers -

here you go, your highness, these are some my slaves none of em can read or write so you can have your way with them now can we get on with it all right all right if you hold the ceremony then I will take that fool and his sperm in the bonds of matrimony all the while thinking I am getting away with murder pure murder perhaps she could not have held back a quiet giggle at the scene, wouldn't you? 

yet, one could also postulate her imagined giggle also as chagrin...even while holding the upper hand -

With her experience and the inherent fear within the freak she married (for who would not be afraid of a woman that decapitated anyone that crossed her wrong ) it must have been child's play to get that puppy trained - - -

Sit, roll over, beethoven...Fetch my silk et al...

In the wink of an eye, it was all over of course and she moved on victorious not to mention with her vault of plundered riches surely servants slave eunochs and assorted others among these  - - -

It is not said, but sadly, that lost moment of pride from pride itself had to be what finally did her in - her death - to always remember having to have bent knee even in the guise of a ceremony was unbearable after basically having been the queen of the chinese seas.

The chinese high seas wherein even the fish were high with opium and spilled human blood -

What nostalgia it must hold for this new generation of radioactive fins...

garbage like landmines gag the unsuspecting depths in plastic poison pollution - - -

sol sole sick world still see how a little girl made herself a title sure lady ala macbeth but isn't that - to defend her as he should - what every single nation on earth has done yes what she did only in large format to level the "other" or invade until it is only us no them?

*Macbeth's Lady as template; empire as scaled piracy.*

Yes it is, which is why marx the k noted of that people opium meaning religion  wherein I disagree as it is essential to some type of order and hope for the many or more but his point is sharp as the hypocrisy underlined say in an ernest tubb tune saturday sinner sunday saint of course not all of them no they ain't but you ask around and you will find the judgement is an easy call to fall on or if y'all so gung ho on not going to hell why not hero up into the hereafter huh well a sin sure we see the reasoning of that seasoning but how is it holy to rake out in a fake shout manifest destiny or some such in dollar wet rust? 

*Marx: "Religion is the opium of the people." Ernest Tubb: country singer, Saturday sinner/Sunday saint hypocrisy.*

She made money and then she made so much money she had what is known as power which was enough to allow her to peacefully walk away from it all into the pages of perhaps hard to find history (since our nationalistic isolationist mind set however global the pretense only gives head to its own echoes)

except within this mess of a novel which was actually based on a quasi clever quest - - -

questions?

*Ching Shih retired peacefully, ran a gambling house, died at 69 in her bed—one of history's only pirates to escape the noose and die of old age.*
