# Chapter Six (Expanded)

---

It was pronounced with a hard sea, *Ciara*—like the K, or the start of chaos. I now pronounce you man and storm, hitting the Kingdom and Emerald Isle as the high-flying flu dethroned the lives of—well, they said it was more than SARS did dine.

Devoid of sleep, he felt the nap required extensions, like a nappy-headed rest in peace, Don Ho, who-bust-I-must-he-lust, which brought him to sexual dream sequences and the desire for more bed time, the chime of the pornesque chapter. How far was he from original intention? Should that be plural?

As dozens died, followed by hundreds, and the natural state of racism inflicted its unique brand of *don't touch me, don't fucking touch me, you slimy Chinese scum-sucking sons of snakes*, could be heard from Minnesota to Malibu—even as the atomic-glowing Japs, divided Koreans, orange Vietnamese no-knees Cambodians, and even conquered Filipinos all exclaimed, *We are not Chinese!*

Of course, there was the exception of Thailand, elbows on thighs. My, how he enjoyed seeing the girls in Beijing pee. Bangkok: the soldier played out a pre-programmed American mass shooting right there, all over the place, rode into Irony Terminal Twenty-One. Clear the way for the Oscars, but the vegan hunger could not be FedEx'd—not fed. A fucking hamburger and fries, they cried, they wept.

**She** used to work at Target—two kids, now Popeye's Chicken. Could be one of those Rexona girls. *Rexona no te abandona*, splish-splash. Speak to me, spic, in your spicorama. Category subsection, sure. But most of those veggies are pure chemical—remember: *Soylent Green is people*.

Point is the heading within amateur clips: she slips it in, and he can neither sigh nor use sensual definitions—well, it don't look like no cock unless we cunt-count Carlos. Punt, fountain pen gloss. **Bianca** wears a cross, pale blonde with ice-blue eyes that reflect the fluorescent supermarket lights like twin moons over a frozen tundra.

Avenue dream: the cat peed like shadows through light, then in between. Hypnotized meetings. Some girl showed him her power, and he could only wonder at the silky white sticky fluid that had flooded his zipper.

Still, risk kept rising—not so much, but enough to penetrate a profit. *Buy me drugs.* He liked the period of tome-time, the start of geno—don't say it, don't jinx it—by Jolly, just side-slide through, except for the ongoing attempt at arguments from **One-Eyed Lou**, a grizzled character with a patchy beard and skin like cracked leather, and the misguided feeling that time was for wasting like a half-smoked Camel. Hey, Kim Hee, kiss me. Best picture: KKK Oreo chorale. He hated seeing **Park** (short black bob, sharp cheekbones, stern dark eyes that hid a volcanic rage beneath) so mad, get killed, and would most like worry about her demise in the art-reflects-life vice versa et cetera, vroom.

We are in the middle of the middle of six. Three stabbed in Maldives. Image, imagine that. We are going to the middle of the middle six, mister mystery. *Pillow of Death*, aha, 1945, proves his point twice more. Nice, ice, mice in the lab. Keelin fell as Sinn Féin refused to kneel.

It was a quick note to six, but it seemed the book wanted to be wroted-writ-hit-pause. When he pressed the playback: Ackerman, woman, private, somewhere, sometime—he felt lime-lime-like-like a historian bringing everybody Kerouac into the scene with a live-love camphor in his jeans. No, not beans, not even greens. He gave in to Lipton soup. Those fucking after-parties are murder on the stomach. Or, if you prefer: belly.

Hang it all, call the deli: turkey cheese on wheat. I mean, it's almost vegetarian. All most. But really, what are they gonna do with all the anima-animals? Not lime-lime-like they could drive an Uber or anything. Oh, you mean the geno—don't say it, don't jinx—Bronx gimmick side-slide is to pave the way for otherwise meat-giving mammals and such? Hmm, maybe even bring back the Dino-Flin-final-stone-bone of blue dinosaur? Will ma any analyze azure T. rex? Bang a hex-gong. What was that song? Oh yes: *Stop in the Name of Love*—before you miss out on the combination lottery. Africa: Ebola, gnarly. Asia: co-rona. Well, it's a million-to-one, but at this price, I could stay at this five-star hotel, now half-price, lime-lime desperate VPN-corp torpedo iPhub for years to come. If not cum. Told-man-old-man down the road screams: *It's soft, not dead! Don't look at me lime-lime-like I'm some China clown in need of disinfectant.* Jess in the shower. Live loves me most in her black name hair. Same dream. To be continued.

## Notes for Chapter Six, Part Two (Finally Not Thumb-Typed, That Is, Back at the Station)

### Headquarters Report Six – October 2022

He imagines, even for a historian, it would be a task of difficult measure to give meaning to events as they pass—or, as it were, events past. Past pants. At the time, he tried to make **J Brand** jeans a seventies thing, like Jordache, but **she** (sharp-eyed, skeptical, with a model's gaunt frame and an MBA's calculated refusal of the obvious) kept trying to dismiss the tried-and-true formula of the pretty model for a more universal look. And I told her: all right, maybe university.

The game was Senet, back in the ancient evenings when a full-grown man was turned into a two-hundred-pound mouse. The dog pulled at his fat Korean wife's blouse. Everybody coughed. Labs throughout the state of California were working overtime to keep **B. Sanders** alive. Well, he almost got hard with that **Ariana Granite** (soft features, eyes like polished amber, lips perpetually parted as if mid-thought)—*It's soft, not dead*.

Soft as cotton crotches. What else is there to do but read *Red and White*? Why would these women film themselves having sex with a beauty product? Maybe it was the name: Rex, Rexo, **Rexona**. Maybe it was **Carlos**—he could not make heads or tails of it.

The Senet piece moved via telepathy. The giant mouse could not find a hiding place except for the grasslands.

*Dictate the number of the account to me.*

**Jessica** appeared—Garcia—at the supermarket and murdered **Bianca**. *So you think you can just up and play house-bank with my husband?*

He danced. **Rexona Woman** (tan skin, athletic thighs, dark nipples barely visible through her white tank top) put-placed the camera on top of her television in the bedroom. Ironic, for all televisions were by nature recording devices, but still she undressed and rubbed, reaching and teaching the world the wonder of deodorant. Well, not spray. Roll-on. She did not squirt like some, yet it added to the weirdness of the impossible catalogue of porn warehoused throughout the Internet.

The epidemic was getting serious about then, and when things get serious, people go on the tele. Boob tube, if you recall. Face mask giveaway for riders of the Tube in London. Another type.

**Bianca's** death (pale blonde, fingers severed, blood pooling around discount yogurt on aisle seven) did not seem to have an impact on him—or perhaps **Jessica's** pout (olive skin, full lips stained with Bianca's DNA, eyes wide with post-homicidal euphoria) made it so.

Coven of the count and counting.

*Why, I was getting used to you not being here,* he said to **Faviola** (caramel complexion, long dark hair ironed straight, a beauty mark above her lip like a painted period), noticing **Scarlet** had straightened her hair and swayed with a swagger usually reserved for the owner.

Red ball bliss. Back home, something smelled like piss. What a headache. Could it be a cold? **Zenyrt** freaking out, not to mention **Sonya's** returning lip sore (pale Russian skin, cracked at the edges, herpes blossoms erupting like tiny volcanoes).

We will pour on the makeup. Hell, we are Japanese, and if we could crawl out from under two atomic bombs, we can deal with this Russian casting call. Period costume.

So-called world leaders went into a secure landline-call frenzy: *Are you sure this is not a cell?*

No, but the **Bing Ping** lied. He'd been out shaking hands for the camera and pointing at medical equipment—yes, with a mask on—as if to say, *None of us are safe*.

*I swear it's not a wireless connection.* All right. Well, it seems that, for fuck's sake, we finally put out that protest fire in Hong Kong. That is why we are the Empire that is going to lead the world on the future—not like those French faggots. Why, they might as well bend over on the Champs-Élysées for any stinker-erection with a yellow vest.

Our baby is out of the incubation period. Every baby needs a name. **Cortana Twenty?** *What the fuck, are we Microsoft?*

**Cobit One?** Nah, it can't sound like no cryptocurrency.

**COVID-19.** Hmm. Yes. Sounds like the mangled basketball-player saint-man. This will go over well. Very well. People will be solemn, stupefied.

*Just for that, I am going to get you that vintage Nintendo you wanted. With GoldenEye.*

**Popeye.** Putin eats spinach, weeps at the *Moscow Times* story where they glued his picture in the elevator and people said, *What the hell?*

The writer had the same reaction, but over the male acting category at the Spirit Awards. *You don't understand—it could have been a clean sweep.*

Madam, I'm Adam. The palindrome: neetenin divoc, **COVID-19**.

The Jews working with the Chinese. Germans shit their pants: *We are going to need a new successor.*

1945. **Lon Chaney** (gaunt face, hollow cheeks, eyes like a haunted marionette) actually had no idea himself he was killing all the Kincaid people.

*Pillow of Death*: Here you go, blondie. Let's see how quickly this cyanide will work on a canine.

In spirit, **Angela** sent one of her dogs, and he was frightened, remembering the ride-or-die motto. Not to mention **Andi's** extremely tight pants (Scandinavian thighs encased in denim so restrictive it seemed vacuum-sealed, each muscle fiber outlined like anatomical illustration).

Of course, it was so long ago—like a dream that echoes at noon, way after waking.

**Kim Hee** (sharp Korean features, high cheekbones, small dark eyes that glinted with mischief and malice) wanked his wicked warrior, and he warned her, *Not so wildly, please,* as those days from two years before flooded his memory.

He had dreamed, nearly at the time when the Mossad and the NSA held that *here-we-go* party, because *this is better than the War on Terror and drugs combined—why, we could take anyone down for a cough or a sneeze. A little pepper in the air. Abracadabra. Two weeks mandatory quarantine.*

Those make-believe Russian girls, **AV** and **NF** (both with platinum blonde hair, surgically enhanced lips, and dead eyes trained by years of camming), tugging so hard at his genitals he awoke fearing a snap in the mechanism. Kiwi-peach Snapple. Six eyelids, Camel. Lux-flux, a gift of love against the jealousy—however, he could not fight. Too much light. The sun. How sweetly dark it felt to him in Asia.

There, in South Korea, as he neared ejaculation—should that be plural?—he could see them: the row of quarantine structures. Workers in green and white, wearing masks, gloves, goggles. Some of them, ear plugs.

He was happy he'd volunteered to go to Wuhan at the start, even if he had not imagined Seoul as his destination.

After being drained by **Kim** and her demons, he fingered through the porn pods for *girls in Beijing peeing*. You see, it had been years since any type of seat could be settled on, and basically there were only cubicles with a hole to aim at, whereupon they squatted. And when the quality was goodly—well, it made him jollify.

He rejoiced in thinking that soon there'd be much more—yes, many more—pure-blood Chinese women to watch as they peed. How beautiful they were, with those sharp yet gentle, feline-like pubic hairs.

Stares too long. Kim Hee gets the vise-grip.

*Please don't! Last time my dick was bent and I couldn't get the batter out!*

It's an awful thing to have to worry about your penis in the middle of a geno—don't say it, don't fucking mention it—side-slide over Charles Darwin married his cousin.

Cuisine, cousin. The Chevrolet Corvair. Cobain song: *In Bloom*, *Lithium*, *Smells Like*—nineteen, COVID, knee, did, vow, oy vey.

## Chapter Six #3

*What are you going to do? Kill me?* **Bianca** had buzzed out against **Jessica's** jealousy (olive-skinned, dark-eyed, hair pulled back so tight it stretched her face into a mask of rage).

Often, the thought of murder is not installed until the very moment of the action.

She'd been a skinny, overlooked child until late in high school and the college years, where men made so many advances it was only natural for her to charge at the retreating writer—too shy to even give her the pair of earrings he'd set aside one day.

Those days, to speak of killing a woman was nearly the norm, and therefore, even if the original package had not come pre-installed with homicide, she was now in a position to strike at her target without restraint.

Her olive skin glowed with dazzling blood splatterings, drying like a post-modern abstract creation.

Cutting off a couple of **Bianca's** fingers (pale, manicured, the nails painted pale pink—now severed stumps leaking arterial spray), she flung them at the customer service area, saying, *And anybody else will get the same, I swear.*

Exclamation point.

---

As Irony would have it, and as much as he tried, there was no viable or visible manner in which to detain his fantasy. Should that also be—yes, you guessed it—plural? Fantasies. They turned, they tuned in to some frequency far beyond his control. All the while pledging a vow of marriage, imagining the pregnancy, and in some cases, even the childrens. Now, yes, that should not be plural, but there you have it.

For Valentine's Day, he visited South Africa, and one of the marginalized white farmers (sunburned face, eyes the color of faded denim, khaki shorts and boots caked in red dust) started telling him about **FGM**, which came up at the sight of the numbers the writer had penned on his left wrist: *6136*—oh, that, yes, initials. **Faviola.**

An eerie flashback crawled against his eyelids: that day when both she and **Anyelina** (another Hernandez woman, fuller-figured, darker-skinned, nails also painted that same flat white-out white) painted their nails white—a flat, white-out white—which he mentioned to the first lady. *How do you say that in Spanish?* **Corrector.** *No, there's another word, isn't there?* **Liquid Paper,** she said it with that dropped-D tuning sound he had heard before. *Yes, that is it, but that is English.*

The conversation trailed away, and he daydreamed then, until running into **Anyelina**, as if to remind him that Hernandez women are here to stay.

Static stomach. **One-Eyed Lou** and the neighbor's castration attempt, number two hundred and counting.

Even the memory of some unsavory situations is enough to make a man vomit, figuratively speaking.

The farmer spewed out the words so quick he felt dizzy: *You see, they call it FGM—it's female genital mutilation. Of course, with these black bitches, if you don't get that out of the way, well, they will stay in bed the whole week, haunting their own clitorises, hunting down that orgasm. I've seen it for myself. Hell, was even tempted to cut my own daughter. You know, say, you got any kids?*

The childrens. Hmm. He hated that question, for the answer could not be expressed without some type of elaborate story next to it.

*Well, no. Or not exactly. But there are a few I consider mine to such an extent as to include them in my estate, my will, when the time comes.*

He remained silent. Breathing. There were no virus quarantine stations in Johannesburg—only the lone Ebola clinic down the street from the Free Male Circumcision joint, which now boasted the sign: *If your wife was strong enough to give up her clit, why aren't you man enough to chop away the foreskin?*

Then, suddenly—perhaps thinking someone should know, in case there is need to have him serve as a witness—the writer rattled off the names of all the girls he counted as his own: the Dutch, the Americans, the Korean, the Swedes, and a couple of others thrown in spur-of-the-moment, like dead fingers at the supermarket counter.

**Jessica** had got away with it, but that is one of the perks of working at the bank.

*We will say she sank into the knife. It was always a matter of time with that type of woman. Half model, half dentist. Looked too much like her sister to have her own identity. Your Honor, we ask to submit her social media profiles as Exhibit A.*

Eyeballs pop out throughout the courtroom. *Order! Order!* The judge pushes the bailiff—both of them baffled. *Nobody move!* It was too late. Squished eyeballs on the floor contrast the wax.

A fiasco. A mistrial.

He loved her all the same, but wondered if something in him was under some sort of spell. Where was his feeling for **Bianca**? She had got a bit heavy below the belt. Could it be—no way to be certain. Fat worked for some girls, and he had learned with the founding muse of this narrative that beauty is a lot more than meets the eye—no pun intended.

Excusing himself for a smoke, he phoned **Brooke** (tall, auburn-haired, eyes like sea glass, voice with a Midwestern flatness that belied her sharp wit). *I'm in South Africa, and this dude looks just like Bill.* But all she could talk about was **Rachel**.

A subject to be continued beyond this section.

*How does he do it?* he says, matter-of-factly. *You have to catch them while they are sucking the nectar.*

Nectar. The sucking. Are they? You will ask, too. However, as always, he will point out the facts—fast, like a psychotic traffic light. A lot of people, the bully kind, unkind, they want this concentration on, say, ashes. But it's the cigarette which burns.

He recalls imposed arguments over things like plants or plates, meanwhile the entire society draining itself. That was an awful time. Not to mention the geno—don't say it, don't hex it—side of elections back then. Millions spent for nothing but the façade of democracy, for the handful to get their payday. Millions that could have been straight-up given to the people, the schools, the school lunches which don't exist there, the hospitals, the clinics which most folks cannot afford—or even anything remotely resembling progress. Millions saved in one step: decree-dance. *We are postponing elections in order to be fair, civil, and decent.*

They act like they are the United States, which can afford such folly, and half the fancy cars on the road are financed on pipe dreams, credit-card impossibilities. Not even for a worldwide life-threatening virus did anybody think, *Hey, we are going the wrong way.*

It was dark. It slipped out. It slid into the anus. *No!* cried **Scarlet** (straight black hair now, Asian features, narrow hips, acne scars like craters on the moon). *No, no, no!*

He rubbed her acne face gently, but instead of seeing her, he saw the **witch from Bali** (wrinkled brown skin, one milky eye, teeth filed to points) blink at him and smirk.

He sighed. She hugged him with an understanding embrace, but then started: *Why did you leave my gift with Faviola? You still want her, don't you? Even after all this time?*

*It's only been a couple of years,* he responded. *And some days it only feels like minutes ago—well, minus the countless gone Asians and Hindus.*

*Will you take me to see the Pizza Hut in India?*

How could he tell her he was now involved in a prostitution ring to make the investment pay off? Perhaps it would be best if we visit Moscow, as planned.

The witch's monkey moved through shadows, shifting from no costume to some sort of Cossack get-up, kicking at his imagination. The witch was not only a witch but a drug. Like Salvador Dalí, she too was drugs.

He rubbed his forehead to rid himself of the witchcraft, only to encounter a **Korean woman** (wide face, thin lips, eyes that held him accountable across dimensions) that claimed marriage rights over her virginity, given to him in the middle of a dream.

*Yes,* he squirmed like a coward, *but it was a dream.*

The court was back in session. A stenographer in a bellhop uniform scraped the remaining eyeball fluid from the otherwise perfectly waxed floor.

A case of sex. A sex case. *But wait a minute,* inquired the judge (bald, jowled, resembling a bulldog in judicial robes). *Is oral sex equivalent to mouth virginity?*

Uproar from the Koreans: *Of course! It's like a giant chewing cum!*

*I need to examine previous cases before a verdict can be grasped.* The judge shook his head, and his own eyes seemed to be on the verge of making exit before he could stand or pound his wood hammer.

*And you—supposedly a law-abiding writer—*

*Allegedly, Your Honor. There's varying interpretations on my books.*

*All right. You, with the long hair—*

*Yes, sir.*

*What have you to add to all this?*

*I was writing Chapter Six, and the next thing I know, well, here we are. But I insist it was a dream, and my ride-or-die team can attest to the fact.*

*Is that so?*

*Yes. Angela and Andi. In fact, there was a sleepover, but I didn't have pajamas because I could not get my TS number from the Telegraph when they had Agent Provocateur silk, and I couldn't sleep—not naked, you know—not with that big dog sniffing around. I'm certain you are familiar with the Doberman scene in The Kids in the Hall portfolio. Well, this was not so many long days after the dream in question—*

*I am going to hold you in contempt until you give me a straight answer.*

*What answer? Nobody wants to be a dog's bitch, as it were. And, well, I got nothing against having another Korean wife, but a lot of people look at them like they are Chinese. I mean, one day she was coughing, and the next thing I know, so am I—suddenly like, is it the flu? Is it the government flu? Did Macron finally grow a pair of balls and powder the briefing before it got to me? Not to mention, is it coro—*

*Court's adjourned! I won't have that talk near my bench! Strike the word 'coro'—well, the prefix—from the record, and instruct the jury to disregard the last few minutes. And you! Why did you say it? You almost said it! Are you trying to jinx it, to nix it? Haven't you read the report? Don't say it!*

*But sir, I wroted the report. It's the other word. Not the name. I mean, the G-word. I should know. Sure, I forget here and there—wouldn't you, with thousands of pages of ammunition manuscripts?*

*Approach the bench.*

The writer nears. The man in the black robe grins sideways. *Big fan. Oh, that Brim. With that King Kong rewrite. I tell you, son, if you want, I will put the whole proceedings in lockdown, and we can have a drink. Or wait—yes, heroin. There must be some in the impound. The narcotics division always makes an attempt to leave some from their take. And I've got a pole set up in my chambers. Yeah, the new secretary—she's been taking sliding-dance lessons. Oh, son, we need to speak of many things.*

It was then that **Gina Hoyt** (sharp features, nose pierced on both sides, dark eyes that saw through bullshit like X-ray vision) pierced both sides of her nose and, during the distraction, hustled the writer away up north.

She turned to him halfway: *This is way more intense than the story you wanted to write about the woman putting out a lit Marlboro in the eye of the groupie trying to flirt with Willy DeVille, isn't it?*

*I suppose it is,* he said, still sad to have missed her at the theatre, way back before doomsday virus alerts and makeshift concentration camps aptly named *quarantine sectors*, when she played that Steinbeck: *Of Mice and Men*.

Then, suddenly, he feared the end. It had been partly Steinbeck—the influence for writing—that California wavy mix of culture and casualty.

*You know,* he added, *some people you love such a long time that they become a part of your life.*

He was composing a song, a blues, a lament, a new language in the face of the end times.

*I think you are one of those people.*

Miles above the state line, at some empty neon gasoline distillery/dispenser—

**Jessica** got into the driver's seat while she was paying for the fuel, the re-fuel. Silently, the murderess sent the wheels upon the opposite direction with only the words: *We are going to see what the deal is with the Noxzema Girl.*

**Gina** hitchhiked in a sort of slow-motion chase to reclaim the writer and see if he would finish that song.
