# Chapter 39.2: Chapter Thirty-Nine Point Two

## Rifle Dream, Mick Jagger Carried Out, Zombie Plane

Rifle dream, a crowd—he had one too. Know exactly how to use the thing too.

A strange transmission...the kind that interrupts itself waking and then proceeds to continue at return dream like a ticket that needs to be punched in.

Yet all too swift, streaming by speed of rapid eye movement—a couple days later only recall **Mick Jagger** being carried out. The scene in near flashback at the sight of *Doom and Gloom* video.

Dream last night: zombie plane, drunk insane swamp dance. Years ago in the ageless hotel he is waiting on a friend, the corpse bones of decomposed cat littered the hallway and so he calls him a pal. One good turn deserving always loyalty.

Leaves the hot day with a lot on his mind, fluff interview. He is more into ice cream than trying to figure out what they mean. Two films, one worse than the other—still, they add to the list.

His partner mentioned ninety percent of them are a scam. Now to figure the ten.

## Ms. Goo Avower Returns, Anna Frank Indiana Jones

How and when, then **Ms. Goo Avower** returned with all the usual desire, yet it has become like Dylan and that uneasy trust. Is the relationship in rust or what to make of Anna Frank Indiana Jones and the stones?

Exactly...well, **Lily** said a child asked her for nudes, then the witch actually posted nudes. Obviously growing a tail, or wanting to—her backside is sorcery and can only fart magic.

Adapted from German, ahem: *No happy farts from sad asses.*

Ass milk, true story...he works overtime on the marmalade.

People are discovering **Nigeria** as if they could stop that little genocide.

## Negro Dream, El Hombre Invisible, Death Dwarf

Negro in dream—a pair of them on the staircase, air of masturbation, they are touching themselves. He steps aside, awakes amazed at the weirdness at the same o'clock as yesterday. Someone playing a practical yolk.

**El Hombre Invisible** said, *I don't like those faces*, seemingly he could see them.

*Death dwarf defines travel flesh.*

Unusual...he wonders if dark people dream more in the sunlight scenes...hard to make out in low light. Prolly so. Memory villain film **LF** wanking at the peep coin peek show.

FL hotel opening, thermal camera temperature, reporter in yellow fringe dress...workers appear like prisoners.

A girl in spandex shorts and tee walks a dog wearing one of those face masks—her, not the hound. Recalls the pup but not the woman.

Whisper of admired secret he does not pour pen over. He smiles, yet it is the last four digits that touches his hand—he returns with irony in a liquid sanitizer and receipt.

The love is gone, yet curiosity remains.

## Kristen as Diana, Joyce Statue, Gardel's Cigarettes

**Kristen** cast as **Diana** felt as if a message. Meaning if that **James Joyce statue** standing in Italy means...what, what does it mean, sideways on a bridge next to above-water boats?

Some few gathered to protect beloved statues because you can see yourself in them—why folks bring cigarettes to **Gardel** or glasses to Lennon in South America.

Of course, seeing the *it takes one to know one* might be the real reason some are toppled.

*Poet attacked in dreams reads National Enquirer headline: WHAT WORLD WAR THREE? WHY WE CAN KILL TWENTY HINDUS IN A DAY WITHOUT MISSING OUR RICE, the Chinese smirk.*

Borders. **Autumn** pressed down on his desire—such weight, such wait.

## Arnold's Muse, Mini Bar Mistake, Yemen

Wait, Arnold's muse complains: *Sure I sold sugar cocaine, but my daughter sucks state trooper cock now, why not thank me for this service?* The mini bar mistake—they said *mini died*, not *many*.

Editor: *We will run with many, amp up the body count.*

The long pizza day—can't figure out the first time he had a pie. There was pain as he left Ms. Goo Avower, but it was physical, not spiritual.

Manhunt in Belfast. *Nothing has been the same since that godforsaken ride is the thing.*

As opposed to *Ham let*—not the play, yet perhaps it is part of the play.

The day as long as driving over unpaved roads. How is it that it takes extremes to notice...streams the movie, still feeling her, failing to understand *inderstand einderstand*.

So is back to multiple orgasm honeymoon? Well no, he won't be treated like that—they have vibrators for that sort of thing. Deletes the picture praise, removes the app.

Wonders about **N26**, gets an account, calls—on hold one hour divided by several calls. Then of course they are Democrats or at clinging to the pretense...no way to have this weird name card numbered telephone many sixes.

Taxi bus laxative—how many folks can shit on **Yemen** at the same time? Now fashionable—meanwhile it has been years.

News from twenty-fifteen fiction returns for a bird's eye view. There is a drowsy flutter surrounding him. He has to wait for two more verdicts and some time before he can see how the deconstruction will conclude, but how he wishes it were with her. Well, one her to be exact, not this or that.

Perhaps he is, yet doubts—suspicion proves more or too much to carry.

## Tofu Incident, Flint Michigan, N-Word Permission

Having lost his man card in the tofu incident, Lizzy's old man took off his shirt and sailed the waves, but once you have that taste there is no going back—a point of no return, might as well go to Sugartaco where the perks are impossible if you happen to work behind the counter and order those never-fill-up-anyone vegan dishes.

Dateline **Flint, Michigan**—ass hanging out of pants, darkie overhears white boy at Macy's: *It's just some niggers.* N-word permission to jump jive and wail—now law DACA caca, beating the shit outta ye, yelling *Don't touch me*—same word but as a POC I can, until stopped by the cop.

Cooperate or else. Sure seems like he is trapped in the time period. Exclamation mark echo news—the needs of others far from entertaining, sure, yet if only a few paragraphs are good enough to manuscript, well, it might yet make a couple of books.

Fantasy double worry...all right, maybe three books given chapter 36.

It is late across the ocean and the next day beyond those shores. They drool over data tidbits stolen in mom or moments of distraction, based on false perceptions in the intention of reflecting an intrusion at privacy in the phrase *reality television*.

Yet as the dead man sang: *I don't have a gun*—memoria, you see, caused mistakes far miles away from his knowledge, coming as you are to pen but never were in the pencil distance.

**Palm.**

## Pretty Hercules Dream, Murder He Says

Pretty other **Hercules** in dream like an old pal, 1920s maybe—ten, *he's me pal*. What a smile, yet as silly moreover than you would have expected—*Have you see the piggies, pig man Pygmalion, no mail?* A banquet suddenly with the old bag, she is chewing meat and everything else on the table as if Roman Emperor time. We saunter down to fried chicken, she bites, says, *No I don't like that*, and from the look of it without taste I agree, then start awaking.

**Murder**, he says, **and my name's Marie**.

---

## Chloe, Co-Workers, Lost Manuscript Pages

Lost in the day, a day lost—first worried in thought that he was thinking **Chloe**, then over her bad luck with co-workers: well, first the *I wanna be Black* rimmed glasses perfume script, then the *I like the anagram of my name* game with TV girlfriend reportedly. Not to mention a live book Face look.

Love knows no limit...like a counterspy.

Finally the lyric to simmer wind, ahem, summer. Simply could not listen, he is not there—nobody home. A no-brainer: **Brian pin dick, it's my bed**.

Seethe and sweat through the sad farce and hose water delivery, loud voice, sharp women maids.

**Darfur** and all the dandruff gone from Yemen scalps after the most intense bombing, as if smirking at social media: *What lives matter? The master needs lives.*

Living for his books, he again attempted to narrow the spaces, but leaving notes on Twitter is far from safe. He figured no one, given the low-level activity, would intrude, but rude will have its way.

From several manuscripts therein of 2017 through then present 2020, one "skipped" from pg 66 to 99—the film script adaptation—and it seemed some early sections were gone. Gaps from where? **Inkrealm Twitter hacked???**

Why...indeed. What got him really wild was a centric eye design with collage which he considered good enough for a cover and the illustration of the book as screen with page-turning as words type and pip plays out scenes, perhaps in split screen—an innovation from the pioneer himself.

Lastly, the quote from **AN** is without the adjacent presidents and shovel, making it weird in an out-of-context *what could this mean?*

That not part of brim but playground if you will. He thought to retweet anew the manuscript as he holds it unedited, but the work involved would be more than a submission to publisher.

Still, then how to explain this in the case of someone including publisher that the search function functionality is not all there or wacky or whatever...names home makes himself look unprofessional after all that work and dedication.

All that waiting, the great unmasking.

This was perhaps or arguably foreshadowed by ABC when they interrupted a link, thus making the annotation void in terms of corroboration. *Take my word it was there* ain't scientific.

*All summer long...it lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me.*

Perhaps all together it was too powerful for the posers to handle. Imposters...they want it a certain way, that is to say not there.

## Stone Mountain, Rachel Weisz, Yemaya

He decides to follow his first path and continue deleting everything not related to work at hand, yet he has so much in between the recent addition and the trial notes stretching back to February seventeen.

A noise from the backyard makes him stand to understand what type of intrusion now stopped his writing thought. Rattle of lick lock and key...oh the memories of next door, *Under My Thumb* battle—same name moved out, replaced with fat ass **Elida** dada mada hadda be the hurry up porch living control.

You don't want to know and more importantly I don't want to tell. Or show. *Don't let them see us, don't tell them what we are doing*...cowards cannot face your own human dogs.

Same word—Burroughs correction on the Macy's beat down: it was unprovoked.

The new republic provokes him—**Stone Mountain** and the president tries to party in massacre town to mixed results. Enthusiasm is waning...it seems, even from Pence: *Am I part of The Apprentice or only in the commercials?* Same with Putin, but worse.

It might be the heat. He eats, peeks at that Moscow scene from *Shadow Recruit*. The fateful words: *No longer an analyst, my boy—you are operational.*

Syracuse, not Brooke but **Rachel**—he considers that **double K** is greater than he reckoned. Seen that movie a couple of times without putting it together that it was her. Underrated actors and that magic. Not them—the character so through and through that it is true.

Contrary to these notes, maybe where the balance is unbalanced by included outtakes and sketches.

Hmm, the blonde Beyoncé honorary everywoman replied to My Chemical Romance and she nearly had it but went into a drowning obscurity worse than the no-bell voice of his generation—my partner insists, *erm, growl, not voice*.

A matter of choice as Hank flexed—*two skinny girls, still champeen*.

A close call, but as far he read, only he had put placed **Yemaya** in poetic stanza before this dancing in five-inch heels shiksa played it out for imaginary movement.

BTW, *inly oy vey*—only one example of obs cure. Dashiki, surly surely not the homo cuz.

*All we need is African fashion instead of Givenchy.*

The Oscars already booked it—she can present and sing, everybody boat I mean vote. Ten songs like a concert, it will be the best bull Oscars yet—ordinary beats now redux. *What if we Wimbledon it?* Yeah yeah, dashiki catering by a Native American Indian restaurant. Three of them in fifty states.

*When we genocide, there ain't much left over—not like the shit pants German might as well be the rabbis' best friend.*

Don't say it, don't jinx it—aw, lookit, the Doberman is barking.

## Lily the Neo-Nazi, Autumn's Pure Blood, Lizzy and Miss Coulton

The witch looks at her backside constantly before a photoshoot and presses down against any possible spontaneous growth during the session.

**Lily**, now entirely neo-Nazi, enjoys great success and even abandons her pets for hours at a time.

*Heil*, the photographer whispers in secret knowing, and she glows with the remnants of the writer's seed and the ghosts of a great defeat that never surrendered.

*Sieg heil*, she inhales and exhales.

*Breathing is free*—opening line of haunted story.

Joyce's portrait eye...the joy after midnight.

**Autumn** said, *How cute is my pure blood*—he paraphrases to segue from salute.

She is wearing of all things little knife necklace in under the chains. He wants to write twenty different notes, yet his own attention was involved in earlier missives—he feels the miss.

Always a mix-up anyway, why worry? Well, as stereo stated before, multiplicity, and to be safe or as safe as that distance will allow.

A few ideas converge, crash: the parking lot victims downtown, a Bruce *My Son Fights Fire* Springsteen song, himself setting flame on **One-Eyed Lou's** sit machine which turned out to be an enjoyable moment, maybe because the mass was on with *Jesus the Seducer*—impossible to resist, guitar strum music so bad the Lord would ask, *Harps, don't you have harps?*—one of the two Coopers now sitting like Elmore Leonard, apple instead of typewriter ad previously on Capone, and wondering if or not to make further **Lizzy** mention as she stood with **Miss Coulton** as if sensing the word play: *Tulsa con is mo*...green, dammit.

One thirty in the morning—it was only a dream note. Same thing happens when he pints an ice cream.

He dreams these packages two—one of them kept awake to hear that they is coming, then later, no, it will be tomorrow.

Mini moet **Eline** takes forever. *Freed me, feed me, Frida*—the witch, now in German Mexican sayeth Clash, *te quiero*, Spanish bombs. But why does he think it a possible tail in his tale? Why not a fin? *Do you know how much time I spend in the water, bla bla, she love the ocean*—not *we done four already* Zep but the unzipped salt. All right, it could be a fin.

Finished with her photoshoot and still hypnotized from awful music and cheap costume changes, **Lily** was nearly abducted by the dog on the street trick.

## Editorial Notes:

**Mick Jagger Carried Out**: Dream premonition of Jagger's death or collapse, linked to "Doom and Gloom" (2012 Stones song about apocalypse).

**Anna Frank Indiana Jones**: Conflation of Anne Frank (Holocaust victim) with Indiana Jones adventure fantasy—trivializing genocide through pop culture.

**Nigeria Genocide**: Refers to Boko Haram killings and Fulani-Christian conflicts—narrator cynically notes Western discovery is too late.

**El Hombre Invisible**: "The Invisible Man"—recurring figure who can see hidden demons/faces the narrator cannot.

**Death Dwarf Defines Travel Flesh**: Cryptic phrase possibly invoking Tyrion Lannister or demonic dwarf mythology.

**Gardel's Cigarettes / Lennon's Glasses**: Carlos Gardel (tango singer) buried in Buenos Aires—fans leave cigarettes. Lennon memorial in Cuba—fans leave glasses. Rituals of devotion to artistic martyrs.

**N26**: German mobile bank, associated with tech surveillance and "many sixes" (666)—demonic numerology.

**Flint, Michigan / N-Word Incident**: Real 2020 viral incident—white teen said "niggers," Black man assaulted him at Macy's, arrested despite provocation. Narrator explores "N-word permission" for POC.

**Inkrealm Twitter Hacked**: Narrator's paranoia that his manuscript (stored on Twitter as notes) was hacked, pages 66-99 missing—possibly self-sabotage or real theft.

**Stone Mountain**: Georgia monument to Confederate generals, site of KKK rallies and Trump's attempted Tulsa rally (June 2020).

**Rachel Weisz / Double K**: Actress in multiple Keira Knightley-adjacent roles—narrator realizes he's conflated them.

**Yemaya**: Yoruba orisha (goddess) of the ocean, motherhood, and life. Narrator claims to have invoked her poetically before it became fashionable.

**Lily the Neo-Nazi**: Lily (Dutch muse) fully embraces fascism, photographer whispers "Heil," she glows with the writer's "seed"—suggesting sexual magic and Nazi occultism.

**Autumn's Pure Blood**: Autumn posts about her dog's "pure blood" (purebred), narrator reads it as white supremacist dog whistle, celebrates her "knife necklace."

**One-Eyed Lou's Sit Machine**: The witch's "sit machine" (vibrator or furniture?) set on fire during Catholic mass—sacramental arson as sexual liberation.

*Chapter 39.2 fragments through paranoid Twitter hacking, manuscript theft, Flint racial violence, neo-Nazi muses, Yemaya invocations, Stone Mountain rallies, and the narrator's obsessive tracking of Autumn, Lily, and Lizzy through social media while Yemen burns and manuscript pages disappear into the digital void.*
