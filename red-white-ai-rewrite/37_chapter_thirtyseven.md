# Chapter 37: Chapter Thirty-Seven

## Marie, Holland, and the Old Bag

Marie...he had gone to Holland, holding a dream of little tits, still too quick to jot, not so much hot.

Heavenly devilish **IA the VG**—well, why not another vow?

Now that Ms. Goo Avower seemed entirely removed from his imagination...

Imagine one picture sending him straight through a thousand hearts, mindless of reminders or remainders.

Was she the vaulted **beau ideal**?

Not *eye deal* pronounced three syllables: *e-dee-ahl*.

What love was all love true love soul mates never die.

An old bag pushing thirty but still his sweetheart muse—he paused so many times that something within wiggled and exploded.

The desire reminding him of how he first started truly to detest certain family members—remembers the *mux mix up lux* seemingly picked up by others like racing baton still distracting.

He gave way. He had to save any sense of honor or hope, then trained his thoughts to look the other way from all those women girls, and even now when he recalls one of them it is like some surprise from somebody else's life—not that it protected or enriched any of them.

Himself **Lucifer** jumping out of those memories to spite the thieves of time disguised in proximity.

Down into the still drifting now freefall—except this time he dreamt of her all through the night. He felt her as if again regained part of himself.

Idea run at arm soul firing at itself.

Taxing the page turning campfire vampire against this love, this love part of immortality.

Things he cannot tell her—wouldn't know how to begin or end a chapter more convoluted than thirty-six.

Yes, the old bag was to him one of the most beautiful visions he could have conjured.

## Radio Interview, JK, and Trans-formative Wounds

All the emotions, not to mention sperm overload. The partner steps in with radio interview—

Thank you, Miami Blue Alec, but how can you not have enough pull to pill the question or at least ask it without requiring response, a rhetorical turn and onward.

He cannot defend his partner. It is how the whole thing came crashing down—that quip over the disgraced producer not being so bad, taken out of context in soundbyte hell. It is also exactly how the associated rumor press label sticks. Perhaps you cannot defend anyone no more.

Fingers chopped off—flashback indeed, nobody kisses us.

**Daniel refuses to stand up for JK**, even...so.

He dislikes the caricature classification.

The **trans-formative** wounds, those white-hating words, kneeling or knot.

Stomach gut—was it the witch all along in a mask, he did anagram ask.

Time zone impaired yet bath in same time.

Side kick sensation—what is symbol or sign and what is wishfill thinking.

**Gentlemen Genet**: *If we behave like those on the other side, then we are the other side. Instead of changing the world, all we'll achieve is a reflection of the one we want to destroy.*

Still, everyone is compelled to make a statement.

Drew the flag, watched *Rick and Morty*, his wife headline.

*Did she did they, we are the...no way...*

Memory of last recorded track plays back. As if it weren't his, a far-away thing like horse track racing results, voodoo zip.

*Stop looking at my dick.*

## Demonology: Seir and the Hierarchies of Hell

Under the well-known names there comes hierarchy:

**Circle One Angels** that used to be the **Seraphim, the Cherubim and Thrones** as in royalty.

Example: **Seir** (sometimes Seire, Seere, or Sear)—**Prince of Hell** with six and twenty legions of lesser demons under his control. Indifferent to the nature of evil, he is able to visit any location and is depicted riding a **winged horse**...as if the irony of having kept his angelic side is reflected upon his carriage.

Certain texts list seventy or so—now imagine the numbers, since each has his own squadron.

In some tomes the major dude devils are mentioned by their counterparts, like **Berith** as opposed to **Saint Barnabas**...feast day **11 June**...eerily near to actual date of writing.

## Black Lives Matter, Hotel California, and Hindu Self-Sabotage

Hunger turns. He feels autumn smile in conquest, although shared by at least a dozen.

How many wives, lonely wives, cinematic news arrives—mantra **Black Lives Matter**, yet the sperm all white, so white he cannot leave. It is **Hotel California**, all these years to only now recognize the voice.

Her tits are not like the dream, or as vein as Isabel, and she is taller than the rest...(

*Hindus decide the way to avert geno—oh don't say don't jinx it—decide geno destruction is to stick cell phone charger into urethral meatus.*

One is caught, questioned, put into jail alongside the pigeon.) Digress, dress, dive into current waves.

Of course, he would give it all to **Marie**, but that choice needs to be made after he is free of aforementioned relative, perhaps plural. **Gaap** was his first inclinario select to here type, but only a **Duke** if memory serves, not a **Prince**.

## Sonya, Aleksandra, and Roses in Ireland

**Sonya** and the hotness mirrored line like ESP as **Aleksandra** pink sky showed after a couple of hopefully rest-filled days.

See here travel, he thought train yet it was clouds...for a too much minute stuck on a political poster in the street. Like a remembrance attempting to overthrow the present.

**Hoses banned in Ireland**...he had not seen roses in so long that when Isabel caressed with curved lips it was rather a thrill.

Of course the music video disturbed him, but flowers and their petals made him still.

**Marie**, especially—*just like normal people line*—*it doesn't feel like this with others*...indeed.

## Editorial Notes:

**IA the VG**: Likely "I Am the Very Good" or a name/title—another muse figure appearing in Holland alongside Marie.

**Beau Ideal**: The perfect type or model, especially of a person. The narrator questions whether Marie (or any woman) can truly embody the romantic ideal.

**Old Bag Pushing Thirty**: The narrator's conflicted affection—"old bag" is derogatory slang for an older woman, yet he finds her beautiful, suggesting his misogyny coexists with genuine romantic longing.

**Lucifer as Self**: The narrator identifies himself with the fallen angel, suggesting his exile from grace, family, and moral order is a form of divine rebellion.

**JK Controversy**: Likely refers to **J.K. Rowling** and the transgender controversy. Daniel Radcliffe publicly disagreed with Rowling's statements, and the narrator frames this as betrayal and censorship.

**Trans-formative Wounds**: Pun on "transgender" and "transformative"—the narrator sees identity politics as literal and metaphorical wounding.

**Gentlemen Genet Quote**: From Jean Genet, French novelist, playwright, and political activist. The quote warns against becoming the oppressor in the act of resisting oppression.

**Seir / Demonology**: The narrator researches fallen angels and princes of Hell, particularly those associated with winged horses, tying back to his "Horse Struck Down by Lightning" obsessions.

**Berith / Saint Barnabas**: Demon Berith is sometimes opposed to Saint Barnabas (Feast Day June 11). The narrator notes this is near the date of his writing, suggesting synchronicity or prophetic timing.

**Black Lives Matter / White Sperm**: The narrator cynically observes that despite BLM activism, his sexual fantasies remain focused on white women, or that racial protest is undermined by interracial sexual dynamics.

**Hotel California**: The Eagles' 1976 song about being trapped in luxury and decadence. The narrator finally "recognizes the voice" after years—possibly suggesting he's been trapped in his own psychological purgatory all along.

**Hindu Urethral Self-Sabotage**: Absurdist escalation—Hindus, facing genocide, resort to bizarre self-harm (inserting phone chargers into urethras) as resistance or desperation.

**Gaap (Duke of Hell)**: One of the 72 demons in the *Ars Goetia*, a Duke (not Prince) commanding 66 legions. Associated with philosophy, liberal sciences, and making men invisible.

**Hoses/Roses Pun**: "Hoses banned in Ireland" = "Roses" banned—possibly referencing Irish water restrictions or a hallucinatory typo.

*Chapter 37 fractures between romantic devotion to Marie, demonological research, JK Rowling controversies, BLM cynicism, and the narrator's ongoing genocidal fantasies, all framed by his Luciferian self-identification and longing for impossible love.*
