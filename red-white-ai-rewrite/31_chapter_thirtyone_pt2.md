# Chapter 31 Part 2: Mossad, Genocide Transmission, and Kill the Humans

## Caste System and Elite Accents

When it comes to the individual, preparations need to be in place so this running around like chicken beheaded will not break the agent's self-confidence.

Practice makes perfect, but damn there were a lot of caste system creatures. Here in England he studied the videotapes of the elite members with their trick of accessing only a specific portion of accent in order to impress—as the onlooker lifts eyebrows, *say that is fine English for a Hindu*...of course, they could dispose of the accent but it served them well.

As the axed Jew died someone celebrated and it made him ponder, but it was only another Jew attempting to balance the origin of his investigation against the hehe Heebs, for it was exactly that sensation during **Palestine massacre** that led him to question his role in the **Mossad**.

No reference to the goddess Kate—a rolling stone gathers no mo'.

SS down to the numbers calculated—sure, the sign-off with **HH** led to code break, but it took the English a while to count if the story is accurate.

He doesn't like London, even for all the history and the Tate, yet he adores his wife and she wants to be here at least for a while longer until our trip to Manhattan comes around.

Too many Arabs and other immigrants. It gives the whole joint a lack of balance which the liberals seem to enjoy, for within that chaos the conservatives suffer.

Imagine you work hard at school and graduate at great expense to only find low-wage jobs, then join the thirty-year-olds-still-at-home club.

## Democrats, Biden, and Egyptian Hieroglyph Helicopters

There was a silence, an unusual silence that seemed to spring from the Democrats, which at that point had pinned their hopes on the less angry and ironically more touchy-feely candidate who possibly had tried to set the trip wire at the door of the White House. *Now we'll get him*, but they realized even as a few children disappeared and washed up dead that the olden ways were not golden no more. Furthermore, all the White House had to do was roll up the windows and declare an extension even beyond the usual eight-year period, period.

Some people have pointed out a **hieroglyph in the shape of a helicopter**, but right near it surely it is a **submarine**.

## Control Station Transmission: The Final Mission

Under the waves, far from worry, even far from that long-ago April early silence with the same corona virus playing corny—where he even tried paying with a *carn of yeller coin* and Steely Dan's *hey nine tea cups* all to have to hold and juggle as it seemed monogamy took practice.

He was pleased at not falling into temptation for legs or tits or no one else, and yet that feeling of needing to escape was strangling him as if in competition with inertia—some sort of ping-pong emotion that he could not shake even if he could by then see the finish line with her.

One of the **control stations** sent out the pump talk transmission which arrived like some sort of invisible pony express:

### THE TRANSMISSION:

*You have prepared for this mission over and over again for years now so that these months should not pressure you in the slightest. We have come a long ass way for you to act like some sort of recruit turning for cover at the mention of one Hindu in Michigan. Sure sure I get it—he had that nicely curved beard like the other boy the Kalaj sisters like so much, but he ain't him, no real estate deals there, and even if there was, what, you want to miss out on opening that Pizza Hut in Calcutta?*

*Come on, where is your backbone, your dedication to purpose—consistency. It may feel cruel but one single solitary head left on any of those necks will start the whole ball game all over again—Adam even Eve and then you know what happens fucking Bollywood fuck that not even the worst cable stations carry that channel no look think of it as salvation for whomever you like can't you see it is all stopped that old ticking nothing this time next year all over and thanks to who them no us yes you.*

*I don't wanna sound like Sexy Beast but imagine your daughter brings home one for dinner dude be the Kali become the Kali don't let it get to you besides there is great danger in exceptions make an exception and well look at the state of Israel remember those were children innocent children this is nothing what India what Pakistan who is going to complain? Forget about it, it's for the future and in the future this will mean you will have a voice in who gets it next maybe those spics you are always on about now that you see how they treated you and all those dead women still dying or yes I know you want it, we need it but the corporations can't get it together yet but imagine this goes down then Africa hell we might actually be able to save the elephants who knows repopulate the rhino hey you think about that!*

**KILL THE HUMANS, SAVE THE ANIMALS**—it got him going nearly as much as the longing thought of his wedding to Miss Goo Avower.

A dream, but weren't life itself nothing more?

Still, upon that **cruellest month** it all seemed so far away that he nearly wept between his fear of patrol people and the inherent loneliness to be found standing lonesome at a distance in a winding crowd line of waiting and knowing he was all alone breathing into a mask that held no promise of companionship as those that sauntered outside the expectation of purchase slid by with curious disdain for even themselves.

At some point, he turned to himself with poetry and re-painted the looming line: **Only Kung and I have walked the forty miles.**

## Editorial Notes:

**Mossad Confession**: The narrator reveals his past role in Israeli intelligence, questioning his involvement after witnessing Palestinian massacres. This adds a geopolitical layer to his genocidal fantasies and paranoid worldview.

**HH Sign-off**: "Heil Hitler" coded messages, suggesting Nazi communication methods that took the British intelligence time to decode during WWII.

**Egyptian Helicopter Hieroglyphs**: Refers to controversial claims that ancient Egyptian carvings depict modern aircraft, used by conspiracy theorists to suggest ancient alien contact or time travel.

**Control Station Transmission**: A command structure (possibly his own fractured psyche or actual handlers) urges completion of an anti-Hindu genocide mission, framing it as environmental salvation. The voice appeals to his racism, family fears, and ecological concerns.

**Pizza Hut in Calcutta**: Darkly comic suggestion that eliminating the Hindu population would enable American fast-food expansion into India.

**Sexy Beast Reference**: 2000 film starring Ben Kingsley as a psychotic criminal. The transmission adopts this threatening, cajoling tone to manipulate the narrator.

**Kali Invocation**: Hindu goddess of destruction and time. The handlers tell him to "become the Kali"—to embody divine destruction in service of planetary renewal.

**Only Kung and I**: Possibly references Confucius (Kung Fu-tzu) and suggests the narrator sees himself as walking a philosophical path with ancient Eastern wisdom, even while plotting to destroy Asian populations.

*Chapter 31 culminates in the most explicit genocidal transmission yet, revealing the narrator as a rogue intelligence agent receiving orders to eliminate Hindu populations under the guise of environmental salvation, all while maintaining his romantic devotion to Miss Goo Avower as psychological anchor.*
