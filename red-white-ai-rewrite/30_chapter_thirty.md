# Chapter 30: Chapter Thirty

## Fantasy, Airline Rape Paranoia, and One-Eyed Lou

After the sequel and reaction sequence, he felt far away from Miss Goo Avower as if nearly she had never existed. Meanwhile fantasy overpowered his imagination and he thrust himself fully into the act of love five times until the object of his desires streamed out vaginal fluids at his recently trimmed chest.

Had he cheated or was he keeping promises as a gentleman should?

## Sonya's Video and In-Flight Date Rape

After reviewing **Sonya's video**, he felt uneasy over the possible fact that airlines could be guilty of date rape...the long flight over oceans, a little something in the meal or drink or both, then the nap—*hey boys she's out, well give it a few more minutes before we see what that mouth can do*...she awakes seemingly worse for wear.

Could it happen? It could, of course. The question is: has it happened? To say, a looker crossing over from a modeling trip in Dubai...gets up with the sound of a baby crying in the background. Thankfully you can't fit a mattress on a plane.

He should have been flying high in dreams yet he was pulled down by the pained idiocy of some spic crowd in baseball hats, then a stranger handing him an empty revolver followed by one bullet, then several.

Men, especially the now nearly extinct Hindu variety, will go to any extreme in order to disorder their testicles.

Still, the beauty of girl overpowered his concern and he carried on carefree save for those unusual dreams and the awful feeling one gets when a great film is stepped on with low-grade sequel.

## Oil Splatter Premonition and Biblical Arguments

The day flowed like the soft falling petals of a flower and he even found Miss Goo Avower, which brought a joyous excitement but also a jealousy at the edge of that very feeling.

During his meal, **One-Eyed Lou** announced that the cooking oil had somehow splattered out and onto her chest, which both made his recent escapade some sort of surreal premonition and downright strange.

Other than that and the disagreement during her prayers—you see, he suggested a preface given that God might actually get a kick out of a global pandemic, not that He needs the press. Needless to say, she disagreed and he needled at the biblical facts: the curiously mean hits in Egypt and the flood in terms of general intention, but also in individual terms as with the obvious **Job**.

What was it? Ah yes, other than that, the hours passed smoothly although he had avoided thinking over the astounding fact of how much life had changed in what seemed to be minutes.

## Pure Writer App and Drakeet the Designer

He did save some notes from that day, as he had noted to counter the earlier claim regarding the writing app.

**Pure Writer**—he liked it well enough, especially when connected to the external keyboard.

It had been updated nine times, perhaps ten, in all of the previous year. However—or in contrast—during that time, well, to be fair, since late January when *Red White* got off the ground at version 14.1, there had been more than twenty updates, which at that juncture made it 14.10.

But to be clear, these did not go 14.2, 14.3, et cetera. Instead, some were 14.4.1, 14.4.2, and so on.

He did not distrust **Drakeet**, reported name of designer, but it sure made him think twice. Wouldn't you?

Fly in the room drunk on cigarette smoke tried hovering low to escape the buzz.

Secret unformed ideas crawled out of his aunt's mouth during a then conversation, and this added to his concerns.

Yet the importance of his choice cannot be overstated—Uber dated, it could also as well wrong.

## Pinsk, Pinkerton, and Monogamy Vows

Pull up calf-length viridescent socks and give the pilot a half-hour auto-drive pit stop race costume change—no wonder one girl licked the occupied toilet.

Oh, a pretty one, window seat, nobody in the next two—stretch you out in more ways than one.

It seemed, and if so, who missed the message, communique clearly a friendly adorable sort even if not exactly muse.

They lived together in Chinese little fridge until the neighbors intruded.

Once upon a time...not to be confused with six days also intruded or *hold my dog might have shot a man in the head at close enough range to say he done it himself I found him after returning from the mall*.

Or to go all the way into overload myth of self—sister of first kiss, lost room, dreamt melting lipstick.

No, none of these—this one **pink pleasant Pinsk**.

Where ate the **Pinkerton men**?

Posse should have Reinhardt gone Django—instead only a frozen mango in the box. Not your usual vibrator.

Partial apologies for the speculation.

Om nom, in any case, hopefully not many case.

He said to Miss Goo Avower that he would attempt and see if monogamy could be within, without coven harem going haywire—*what about me*—not to motion mention promises.

Next to impossible surely, yet the only way to wear his adoration as the stakes were raised in seduction and distraction.

## Editorial Notes:

**Sonya and Airline Date Rape Theory**: The narrator speculates that flight attendants or pilots drug and sexually assault attractive female passengers on long-haul flights. This paranoid fantasy reflects his broader distrust of institutions and authority, as well as his obsessive sexualization of women.

**One-Eyed Lou / Oil Splatter**: The "witch" or domestic partner figure who menstruates, prays, and suffers minor domestic accidents that the narrator interprets as supernatural or symbolic premonitions. The cooking oil splatter on her chest mirrors his earlier fantasy masturbation where fluids appear on his chest—suggesting a psychic or coincidental link.

**God and the Pandemic**: The narrator argues that if God exists, He enjoys human suffering—citing the plagues of Egypt, the Flood, and Job's torments as evidence of divine sadism. His partner (One-Eyed Lou) disagrees, maintaining traditional faith.

**Pure Writer App / Drakeet**: The writing app the narrator uses to compose *Red White*. "Drakeet" is the actual developer's username, but the narrator finds it suspicious (Drake +eet = dragon eat?), feeding his paranoia that the app itself may be surveillance or a coded message.

**Pinsk, Belarus**: City in Belarus with significant Jewish history, repeatedly referenced in the manuscript. The narrator's fixation on "pink pleasant Pinsk" ties to his obsession with Kim Hee ("pink lock") and suggests Pinsk as a symbolic location of romantic idealization or lost Jewish diaspora.

**Pinkerton Men**: 19th-century American private security/detective agency notorious for strikebreaking and violence. Also, famously, the character Lt. Pinkerton in Puccini's opera *Madama Butterfly*, who abandons his Japanese wife. The narrator conflates labor violence, operatic betrayal, and his own guilt over idealized Asian muses.

**Django / Reinhardt**: Django Reinhardt, Romani-French jazz guitarist. Reference suggests the "posse" (vigilantes or law enforcement) should have honored artistry and freedom instead of pursuing racist violence. "Frozen mango" may be a pun on "Django" or a sexual innuendo (frozen = non-functional vibrator).

**Monogamy Vow to Miss Goo Avower**: Despite physical and emotional proximity to One-Eyed Lou (the "witch"), the narrator pledges fidelity to the distant, possibly imaginary Miss Goo Avower, framing this as a spiritual test and the "only way to wear his adoration."

**Hindu Extinction and Testicle Disorder**: Continues the narrator's apocalyptic fantasies about eliminating the Hindu population. "Disorder their testicles" suggests both emasculation and chaotic desire—linking genocide to sexual anxiety.

*Chapter 30 spirals through masturbatory guilt, airline rape conspiracies, domestic oil omens, app developer paranoia, and the narrator's impossible monogamy vow to an absent muse, all while invoking Pinkerton violence, Django's ghost, and Biblical sadism.*
