# Chapter Twenty-Six

## Preface: Dracula by Cinema (and the WWII Afterimage)

When I first wrote this, I hadn't read Stoker. My Dracula was a reel: Browning's 1931, Herzog's pallor, Coppola's baroque blood, Langella's velvet, Hammer's technicolor bite—the shadow on a wall, history's blackout curtains. Only later did I find the lattice of diaries beneath the myth.

World War II sharpened the irony: regimes worshipping blood and soil while building assembly-line death; a Europe staking vampires while mechanizing vampirism. My working theory still holds: the world ended sometime between late 1944 and early 1945; everything since is replay and patchwork, a salvage edit. To get poetic—humanity is Dracula, waiting centuries only to find, as Dylan sang, no direction home.

Something else was in control, not him and so he waited. Often he would riot against the temporary lobotamy, but having gained more perspective he was more inclined to wait. 

An idea was forming along with jealousy.

*Bataan Death March, April 1942. The Philippines fall. The flag planted.*
