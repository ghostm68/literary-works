# Chapter 42 & 42.5: Chapters Forty-Two and Forty-Two Point Five

## Chapter 42: Gina Hoyt, Yellow Frogs, and Sperm-Drenched Keys

There were, he finds without specific finances, several **moe** mentions of **Ms. Hoyt**.

Moe? Right, **more**. Like the cigarette.

There was also one called **True** with a peace symbo shape filter. Symbo? Left out the Elle.

He stood there before the mirror with the same type of rash as in *The Great Clavicle*, thought of her. Had she gotten so wise that he could not tell?

At the no-tell hotel, South Carolina, the concierge explained that some guests unplugged everything at the feeling of paranoia. He put the hated mirror in his bathroom, with stealth.

Now how to steal into this chapter which should intend to begin to finish these notes.

Ah yes, more symbol perhaps than seduction—**Gina Hoyt** with piercings and tattoos pounded a stomp against the floorboards at the sight of yellow frogs, for if you must know they were her "thing". That it caused the witch thousands of miles away and distracted by the arrival of her birthday mother—for what else could she be, these being the birthday chapters?—caused her to slip slide off her fat bottom girl queen bicycle, leaving her with missing knee skin—ouch.

She bled, his head turning somewhere between Tokyo and Detroit as **Megan Shaw** with unnamed titties downed a fifth of peach mango Echo Falls.

Falls, falls, false—repetition of snippets has to be some sort of mind control which has woven itself into our post-modern times. Wavelength wars...glitch battles.

*Bitches wanna self-medicate with weed. I am bitches*, said the other Lauren as he inserted too many characters yet again. It is a big room but ain't that big.

*It's a small world after all*—an **Aleksandra** photo collage painting ended the day because he dreamed of her, or maybe because he spelled her name Alexandra instead in recent page.

He felt good, demonstrating admiration, love, or if you insist, lustful artistic desire. There was satisfaction.

Before, wherein the sounds floated ghost-like in silken gowns—meaning he won't say who or what—yet every so often another, mostly in this case the girl in the van, perhaps for worry, possibly for a wondrous type of creepy that might well be all his own.

In the exhale of satisfaction he drew the image happily.

## Sperm Dream: Keys Drenched

Then he dreamt, a thundering scene that made no sense to him as he awoke only several long minutes after rapid eye movement to actually feel rested, if a touch nervous.

He could see himself on a bed, a girl was there yet distant as if she could command from no nearness. The bed was in front of his old wooden desk which in the dream did not have the later addition of the wooden bookshelf. It was light, as if afternoon had only started to give way to dusk.

He felt himself awaking, a shot of **sperm awash on his right elbow**—too much to brush away all at once—and rising he turned to the head of the bed where the desk was to find **two sets of keys both drenched in sperm**.

He held these in his hands and ran the sink's faucet as he awoke, feeling surely that a wet dream was or had been in the works, yet it was only imagination—or yes, let us gather strength and venture into that realm beyond—well, what is beyond imagination? A different dimension.

He thought it over for a while, chewing stale bread and warm coffee as cigarettes, neither More or True, smoked away as he soaked yet again to escape the heat.

He lay again for a much longer time without anything seemingly worthwhile or captivating enough to haunt him as he got up in the early evening. Some sort of uninspiring conversation over investment with a man he could not or did not want to place in memory—the type maybe we all deal with along the lines of the day to get from point A to point B, or if buzzed, bee.

## Earthy Emma, One-Eyed Lou's Gas Burner Possession

**Earthy Emma** proclaims she believes in a litany of conspiracies, yet most often it is those near to us that make for such thought.

Proclaims? Center, center, sent her an eye...ay, proclaims the I, tho clams sang slang as money also in other thoughts.

Well, sure, the television...he fears watching it with a new theory that all the channels will come through at once, making the brain melt in a sensory overload, but presently there is no better way to distract **One-Eyed Lou**.

Somehow, the evening found him omnipresent—one war extinguished, one battle avoided—both by answer quickly and turning away, but also *Tomorrow Never Knows* on the headphones at the start of the feeling.

It was there, perhaps not even from her. Unable to capture his attention into derisive insults and verbal fighting, she—seemingly possessed by a contradiction in self-preservation—put the rice to heat after it was done twice, no reason, then after he turned off the gas switch left another burner go, which hopefully he found in time for it not be a drain.

**It was on purpose but he doubts it was her purpose.**

Some things one cannot know, maybe one should not know.

With the intended organization and moved mirror done, he felt satisfied even if hunger visited him moments after his meal.

The hours after midnight crawled in the way they still tend to in places where ambulances and fire trucks do not frequent the avenues, leaving the night sky to shine and feral cats to explore the slow-motion show of littered walkways.

Half an hour and some minutes extra to look up those notes and write these paragraphs, it felt longer to him as if he was not in speedy form or as well informed of his own jottings as he might be.

*Hive work dive honey, will there be anything to love?* Well, come on, cum-dripping keys of the white elbow writer—it has to be unique even in other dimensions, don't you concur?

Well, red-knee witch is thinking along the lines *some of us cannot live with our mortgage, I brought you into this world and I can take you out* mothers, yet she might not know of the Hoyt pound.

Things almighty strange or even stagnant can and will...

## Chapter 42.5: Times Square

**Tim ess quare...tea mess queer...Times Square.**

---

Half light and half haunted.

He lay upon his choice to rest away the wee hours, contemplating humanity's nefarious or even notorious arguments which tended to substantiate or even dubstep ideas as thin as starving children in Yemen, Lebanon, Venezuela, and points continental.

Yet what was his idea, here in these pages, here in the work in progress?

## Editorial Notes:

**Gina Hoyt / Yellow Frogs**: Gina's obsession with yellow frogs causes synchronistic events—witch falls off bicycle, loses knee skin. Yellow frogs = mating signal = sexual magic transmission.

**Sperm-Drenched Keys**: Dream where two sets of keys are covered in ejaculate—keys as access/control, sperm as creative/generative power, suggesting the narrator's writing unlocks dimensions via sexual energy.

**One-Eyed Lou Gas Burner Possession**: The witch, unable to provoke argument, is possessed by external force that causes her to leave gas burner on (attempted murder or accident?). Narrator: "It was on purpose but he doubts it was her purpose"—demonic agency acting through her.

**Hive Work Dive Honey**: Bee/hive metaphor—narrator as worker bee producing honey (manuscript) via pollination (muses). "Cum-dripping keys of the white elbow writer"—masturbatory/nocturnal creative process.

**Times Square Anagram**: Tim ess quare = tea mess queer = Times Square—linguistic collapse reflecting the narrator's disintegrating relationship with linear time and space.

*Chapters 42 & 42.5 spiral through Gina Hoyt's yellow frog magic, sperm-drenched key dreams, One-Eyed Lou's possessed gas burner arson attempt, and Times Square anagrams, all while the narrator questions whether Red White has any coherent "idea" beyond stream-of-consciousness documentation.*
