# Chapter Seventeen

## Preface: The Cut-Up Method as Oracle

Burroughs taught us that language, when dismembered and reassembled, speaks prophecies the linear mind cannot utter. The cut-up is not chaos—it is the randomness of the Tarot, the I Ching's hexagrams tumbling into meaning. Chapter Seventeen arrives pre-fragmented, a mosaic already shattered, daring the reader to find the face in the broken mirror. *Juliet in Rome becomes iOS—interface of the heart, operating system of desire.* This is not a chapter. This is a séance.

*The cities as verbs: Times Square attends you, Piccadilly conjugates your loneliness, Place de la Concorde becomes cangor—cancer and languor married in a portmanteau plague. You don't visit the Champs-Élysées; it wears you like a dress, a whore's costume stitched from tourist euros and the sweat of colonial memory.*

*Sinsemilla: the seedless marijuana, the sterile thought. Philadelphia as destination and punchline—you want to stroke, but the city of brotherly love offers only brothels of strangers on pleasant, relaxed flights to nowhere. Family becomes "familay"—the corpse of kinship laid out in state. The witch has a license to interfere because authority is always already deco—decorative, decadent, decaying.*

import such includes earn france whore can square ask in parenthesis w combat wore clash rock

figurine authority interfere internal feAr over wait tip invented seconds deco as matters slant philadelphia to make it over weight -

*The figurine of authority—small, porcelain, easily shattered. Internal fear capitalized mid-word because Fear is a proper noun now, a person, a place, a thing you can touch. Overweight Philadelphia, city of cheesesteaks and constitutional conventions, where liberty is a cracked bell and democracy a diet that doesn't work.*

in a name to long two names too long -

*What's in a name? Amen. A-men. The men who say amen. Song as echo, echo as sip, the sound mounting like a fountain. Muck becomes fuck in one letter's slide.*

glass etiquette shatters mad hatters grass ethiopia ladder ufo of united stations,

*Glass etiquette: the manners of the fragile, rules written in ice. The Mad Hatter's grass is Ethiopian—high-altitude weed, Rastafarian sacrament, the ladder Jacob climbed repurposed as a UFO launch site. United Stations, not Nations—we are stops on a transit line, platforms where trains of thought collide.*

nations gas tofu red dali elephant star wars true story he worried a while about being worn as a terrorist, executed order eye phone, blind to big picture brother, but others thought it too as honk horn thinking maketh so a mask - 

*The iPhone as executed order, the smartphone as firing squad. Big Brother is blind to the Big Picture because he's staring at a screen six inches from his face. "Honk horn thinking"—the brain as traffic jam, the mind as gridlock. Thinking makes it so, or maketh it sew—stitching reality from thoughts like Frankenstein's flesh.*

in other word z war it is backwards it is not cold or hot well hell down a plan plane in the current location of the agent off the reservation lodging for two table split personality we have a plan we swear yet still guessing at the endgame - 

*Z-War: the final alphabet conflict, Omega vs. Alpha. The war backwards—raw, the edible and the wounded. The agent off the reservation (Indian land, insanity, both) books lodging for two because even split personalities need accommodations. The plan is sworn to, but the endgame remains occult—hidden, mysterious, a Tarot card face-down.*

sports? third base nettles who is on first second base forget backwards go scrabble grab the anywhere most recently seen at obituary...

*Abbott and Costello as prophecy. Third base Nettles—the Yankees infielder or the plant that stings? Who's on First has died and been reborn as a Scrabble game where the tiles spell only epitaphs. "Most recently seen at obituary"—we are all last spotted in the death notices, brief and forgettable.*

the chess game a chest of threads he cannot knit total war -

war totals snatch catch giveaway vietnam -

*The chess game as hope chest filled with threads—potential tapestries never woven, strategies unstitched. Total war is war that totals everything, an accountant's apocalypse. Vietnam as giveaway—the jungle as game show prize, bodies as parting gifts.*

smoke screen thicker than the ball room orgy birch to birch shade each other genital gentle until no gentle man left right follow orders follow influenza social mafiA you see it and you dont ad lib the lid hid from the cover the coven leaf the leaves grease the light falling fall in all in like a joke all true yet said so no feral feeling not breaking break in gate water helicopter helios heels so what does he feel -

*The ballroom orgy as smoke screen, sex as distraction from the real obscenity. Birch trees shading each other, gentle genital contact until every gentleman is gone—drafted, dead, or degenerated. Follow orders, follow influenza—obedience as epidemic, disease as command structure. Social Mafia with a capital A for Alpha, for Omertà, for America. The coven's leaf greases the light—witchcraft as lubricant, illumination as slip and fall. Helios in heels, the sun god in drag. So what does he feel?*

nothing to be said oh see a red it thread in your head in my bed duty honor country 

*Nothing to be said, but see—the imperative to witness. A red thread (Ariadne's, the Red String of Fate, the scarlet letter) running from skull to mattress. Duty Honor Country: West Point's motto, the soldier's trinity, the excuse for every atrocity.*

which way thisaway kiss away rock and roll all night and party everyday back to the twenties hes my pal, ol sport cannot sort 

*KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid, or Knights In Satan's Service, or the band in greasepaint and platform boots. Rock and roll all night—the '70s as eternal present, the party that never ends but never satisfies. Back to the Twenties—the 1920s, the 2020s, Gatsby's "old sport," the past as pal you cannot sort (organize, understand, separate from present).*

spiro soiree death kids say oh well rip...

*Spiro Agnew's soirée, Nixon's attack dog hosting a party where death is the guest of honor. Kids say "oh well" and "RIP" with the same inflection—indifference as the final stage of grief.*

rip as in torn if i had a hammer and that there is the essence of the country surprise surprise cowboy to indian master to slave city to minority maidstone to mailer - 

*RIP: Rest In Peace or ripped apart. Pete Seeger's hammer becomes the tool of conquest: cowboy to Indian (genocide), master to slave (chattel), city to minority (gentrification), Maidstone to Mailer (Norman Mailer's 1970 film where he bit off Rip Torn's ear—art as literal bloodsport).*

say everything say nothing if you see something never four get the noise r us upstairs down stares- 

*"If you see something, say something"—Homeland Security's slogan weaponizing paranoia. "Never four get"—forget split into for-get, the act of acquiring forgetting. "Noise R Us"—Toys R Us bankruptcy as metaphor, childhood dead, only static remains. Upstairs, downstairs, down-stares: the class system as architecture, the servant and master eyeing each other on the staircase.*

or was he still snowed in at the overlook hotel motel holiday in cambodia - 

*The Overlook Hotel from The Shining, Jack Torrance typing "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" 10,000 times. Motel/hotel/Holiday Inn—transience as permanent condition. Dead Kennedys' "Holiday in Cambodia"—punk as political education, Pol Pot's killing fields as tourist destination for spoiled American brats.*

my country tis of thee free speech for liberal

sodomy lover abortion blue state blur suburb skateboard over tv overt commercial break breaking break in - 

*"My Country, 'Tis of Thee" sung to the tune of "God Save the Queen"—American anthem as British hand-me-down. Free speech for liberals only—the First Amendment as gated community. Sodomy, abortion, blue states: the Fox News fever dream. Skateboard over TV—youth culture as vandalism of mass media. Commercial break as breaking-and-entering, advertising as home invasion.*

other wise cast in the iso install lation 

*Otherwise cast: the actors not chosen, the lives not lived. Iso-installation: isolated, insulated, installed in solitary confinement. Lation as suffix and nation—the country of alone.*

elation excuse me he did drugs heard the voice of veronica lake drunk on moloch drink tell him to druid nike do it wagner drum 

*Elation as excuse—joy as alibi. Veronica Lake: 1940s film noir goddess with the peek-a-boo hairstyle, blonde hair covering one eye. Moloch: the Canaanite god demanding child sacrifice, the deity of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl." Druid Nike—ancient priesthood meets corporate swoosh. "Just do it" as Wagnerian leitmotif, consumer capitalism as Ring Cycle.*

dream capsule speed of light from amcient rome or gaul invented by egg egypt nazi blueprint spaceship 

*The dream capsule: pharmaceutical, architectural, temporal. Ancient Rome, Gaul, Egypt—history compressed into a pill. Nazi blueprint spaceship: Operation Paperclip, von Braun's V-2 rocket becoming NASA's Saturn V, the moon landing as victory for fascist engineering.*

pod arrived but he is two years old raised by dominican apes this shit is going to take decades - try monkey money try no fun funds -

*The pod person from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but he's two—Superman's origin as horror story. Raised by Dominican apes (Dominicans as primates, the casual racism of empire, the monastic Dominicans—Order of Preachers—as evolutionary dead end). "This shit is going to take decades"—parenting, therapy, decolonization, all on the same timeline. Monkey money: capital as feces, economics as excrement. No fun funds—austerity as aesthetic.*

aches the government - 

*The government aches. Not "the government makes him ache" but the government itself is in pain—the state as arthritic body, bureaucracy as chronic condition.*

god turns to satan hey lucifer get back here-

*Milton's Paradise Lost as sitcom. God and Satan as bickering roommates. "Get back here"—the Prodigal Son, the runaway, the rebel angel summoned like a dog.*

top agents stop their things from rings, twenty seven years back to age four - 

*Top agents—CIA, FBI, KGB, or celebrities, influencers, the famous. They stop their things from rings—prevent their possessions from forming circles, break the loop, interrupt the cycle. Twenty-seven back to four: the math of regression, therapy, reincarnation.*

fuck a duck maybe he is the devil...

*"Fuck a duck"—cartoon profanity, Daffy as sex object, bestiality as punchline. "Maybe he is the devil"—the agent, the writer, the reader. Uncertainty as damnation.*

no demon ever poetry demonstrated - no, then zarathustra wroted beyond good and elvis...

*"No demon ever poetry demonstrated"—demons do not prove through verse, or no demon has ever been poetic. Zarathustra: Nietzsche's prophet, the Persian sage, the man on the mountain. "Beyond Good and Evil" becomes "Beyond Good and Elvis"—the King as moral terminus, rock and roll as transvaluation of all values.*

(season four six million dollar man)

*Lee Majors as cyborg, the astronaut rebuilt by government contract. Season Four: 1976-77, America's Bicentennial and Carter's election. The Six Million Dollar Man as post-Vietnam prosthetic—we can rebuild him, make him better than he was, faster, stronger, more obedient.*

levis,  no belt twenty twenty three he glances at his wife, everybody else seems oiled oblivious to what tow hat is at stake as the remaiming imgdians revolt to scalp we the creators...

*Levi's with no belt—the uniform of the casual apocalypse, 2023 as perpetual Saturday. "Tow hat is at stake": what is at stake, or tow/toe, or tow-head (blonde child). "Remaimg imgdians"—remaining Indians, or imagined Indians, or IMG-Indians (image files of indigenous people, digital ghosts). They revolt to scalp "we the creators"—the Founding Fathers, the content creators, the demiurges of this simulation.*

reason like the sun might not return shine if we doan aztek kill the many or inca more...

*Aztec and Inca logic: the sun must be fed with human hearts or it will refuse to rise. "If we don't kill the many, or Inca more"—Inca as verb, empire as action. The human sacrifice is preventative maintenance, the genocide is HVAC for the cosmos.*

italy went all in two towns then entire country vision total twenty anything war get the somali rot sum cleared away from the tourist areas...

*Italy, March 2020: two towns (Codogno, Vo'), then Lombardy, then lockdown. "Vision total twenty anything war"—2020 vision, perfect sight into total war. Somalia as rot, as sum to be cleared—the African as arithmetic problem, ethnic cleansing as urban renewal, genocide as TripAdvisor optimization.*

stack coffin invited to fold in method instead of cut up burial at sea giovanni could taste africa in the fish platter at il rostorante bistro

*Stack coffins: mass graves, the economics of death. "Fold in method instead of cut up"—Burroughs' technique, but also body disposal: fold the corpse or dismember it. Burial at sea, the Mafia method, Bin Laden's end. Giovanni tastes Africa in the fish—Mediterranean cuisine as graveyard, the sea as cemetery, every meal a memorial.*

oh boy and the ball bounced oh boy in the bubble houses now plastic became scarce- 

*"Oh boy"—Buddy Holly's refrain, the verbal tic of excitement degraded into dread. The ball bounced—childhood game or stock market crash. Bubble houses: transparent suburbs, geodesic domes, the plastic fantastic giving way to scarcity.*

the scar of a plague not even vegas odd makers were wagering on covid nine tea...

*COVID-19 as "covid nine tea"—the virus as afternoon social, the pandemic as Earl Grey. Vegas oddsmakers caught off-guard—even professional gamblers couldn't bet on this black swan.*

inertia milk one narrative world order, well whatever they wanted so long as he club pubg could write and play no curry no spic to me respeak beak bird word we always wondered about the pigeons oh hell this one time yao can ass key odd couple the english ladies we digress is that arab wielding a dagger...

*Inertia milk—the dairy of paralysis, stagnation you can drink. "One narrative world order"—NWO as singular story, conspiracy as grammar. Club PUBG: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, the video game as social club, violence as leisure. "No curry no spic to me respeak"—the xenophobia of tongue, the palate as border patrol. Pigeons: rats with wings, or stool pigeons, or carrier pigeons bearing messages in wartime. Yao Ming (Chinese basketball star) becomes "Yao can ass key" (you can ask, he/she). The Odd Couple—Neil Simon's mismatched roommates. English ladies digressing. An Arab with a dagger—Orientalist panic, the terrorist as eternal specter.*

allah is one and all gangway stampede eloise peed he felt the inclination porn beige in binge view pussy stream like a bong hit billow over his pillow with the words to weeping willow -

*"Allah is one and all"—the Shahada remixed. Gangway, stampede: the Hajj crush, pilgrims trampled in Mecca. Eloise peed—the Plaza Hotel girl as incontinent, childhood as loss of control. "Inclination porn beige"—the color of arousal drained of saturation, desire in neutral tones. Binge-view pussy like Netflix, pornography as streaming service. Bong hit billowing, marijuana as pillow talk, "Weeping Willow" (the song, the tree) as soundtrack to stoned masturbation.*

he was in fact nothing save a love for women love for song love for narcotic high that kept diminishing in a world of melting mirrors.

*Here the cut-up clears. The sentence coheres. He is nothing but three loves: women, song, narcotic. The high diminishes—tolerance builds, dopamine receptors downregulate, the party ends in increments. Melting mirrors: Dalí clocks, the self liquefying, unable to reflect, Snow White's evil queen watching her face run like wax.*

every theory could or would meet the same conclusion, he comsidered.

*"Comsidered"—considered, but also "com" (with, together, completely) + "sidered" (from Latin sidereus, "of the stars"). Every theory, whether it could or would, ends at the same point—entropy, death, the heat death of the universe, or simply the realization that all explanations are provisional. He considered this with the stars watching, under the same conclusion: stellar and fatal.*

## Epilogue: The Oracle Closes

Chapter Seventeen refuses to be a chapter. It is a seizure, a glossolalia, a Pentecostal fire burning on the tongue. Burroughs cut up newspapers to reveal the hidden control mechanisms of language; here the language is *pre-cut*, arriving in shards, demanding assembly.

The reader becomes bricoleur—Claude Lévi-Strauss's handyman, making do with whatever's available. Juliet and Rome and iOS. Glass etiquette and Ethiopian ladders. The Six Million Dollar Man and Veronica Lake and COVID-19-tea. There is no plot, but there is pattern. There is no narrative, but there is rhythm.

*This is the chapter that writes itself, reading itself, eating itself ouroboros-style.* Every word is a trapdoor. Every line a tripwire. Walk carefully. Or don't. The text doesn't care. It has already moved on, cutting itself up, folding itself in, burying itself at sea where Giovanni tastes Africa in the fish and the sun decides whether to return based on how many we've killed today.

The scar of a plague. The mirror melting. The theory's conclusion.

*He considered.*
