# Red White - Chapter One (AI Expanded)

*An expanded rewrite that deepens the original's themes of pandemic paranoia, population control, and literary obsession*

## Chapter One - The Lockdown Prophecy

After the lockdown—though lockdown was merely the sanitized term they fed to the masses, like calling genocide "ethnic cleansing" or calling mass surveillance "homeland security"—what is now remembered in the classified files as the systematic extermination of Wuhan transpired without a hiccup. Without a goddamn hiccup. Hick town, nowhere, China, they called it in the briefings. A beta test site. Ground zero for what the suits in their climate-controlled bunkers euphemistically termed "demographic restructuring."

"We can't treat these people like cockroaches," some cried—the bleeding hearts, the ones who hadn't yet learned that empathy was a luxury the new world order couldn't afford. The Governor, his face a mask of bureaucratic satisfaction, pulled out a spray can from his briefcase like some twisted magician revealing his final trick. He squeezed some of the venom's contents into the sterile conference room air, watching it mist and settle like industrial snow. As he giggled—a sound that would haunt the nightmares of anyone with a functioning conscience—his laugh echoed off the marble walls of power.

The meetings had been held in rooms that didn't officially exist, in buildings whose blueprints had been burned decades ago. "No, look at the outrage," the advisors whispered, shuffling their classified folders like tarot cards of doom. "Even if they admitted it was a military error..." But admission was never the plan. Plausible deniability was the cornerstone of modern warfare. "Besides, not enough people fly due to economic reasons anyway—we are doing what we can with the boats, but this, oh this..." The voice trailed off into anticipatory hunger. "How juicy. Dozens of them every day. Why, in the second round we can easily start from scratch in India and Pakistan to boot—think of the real estate opportunities!"

The real estate opportunities. That's what they called mass graves in the corporate boardrooms.

The writer sat bent over his unholy trinity: coffee, cigarette, and keyboard—the modern writer's communion with chaos. It was at the edge of the lunar new year, that liminal space between death and rebirth, wherein two eerie trials in America attempted to annihilate the recent onslaught of royal abdication news. The trials were circus acts, designed to distract while the real show played out in laboratories and military compounds. Meanwhile, the Kremlin, always the master of dark humor, reminded the world that it was all a circus: "Here, comrade, look—two aging elephants have escaped and can be seen tusk-wild, traveling through the snow-packed streets."

Neither trial made sense, which was precisely the point. Confusion was the weapon, chaos the strategy. One could argue that the entertainment industry had always been based on a culture of exploitation, of consumption, of turning human souls into marketable commodities. In one trial, this was the obvious subtext. In the other, to prosecute tactics of international negotiations? Well, might as well throw everyone who ever held public office in the slammer. But that wasn't the real crime. The real crime was the systematic dismantling of human civilization, dressed up as public health policy.

Hammer judge headline punch—the words crashed through his consciousness like debris from an exploding media landscape. Penis-shaped chocolates and obstruction of justice, Spokane spooky Ukraine—nobody here had ever spoken of Ukraine before it became convenient, before it became another chess piece on the board of manufactured consent.

It started coming in fast and heavy, like a data stream from hell: a woman in London, a couple in Wisconsin, a family in Honduras. The images were perfect, too perfect. Hospital rooms and clinical equipment that looked right—sterile, professional, on the up and up. The images pre-recorded and pre-digested in the collective mindset for instant recognition, like a brand logo seared into the consumer unconscious.

Asian faces shielded with surgical masks, their humanity defeated by fabric and fear, reduced to livestock in the eyes of television audiences worldwide. The archetypal foreign threat, the yellow peril updated for the digital age. Defeating their own humanity as the world watched, transfixed by the pornography of suffering.

The roach struggles to reach any sort of exit, legs squirming in that universal dance of desperation. Every human becomes an insect when the boot comes down.

"Check in, but they don't check out." The writer muttered to himself, channeling the Eagles through a lens of apocalyptic irony. "Welcome to the Hotel California, Wuhan version."

He saw two lovely women sauntering under a single umbrella, their gift wrap left behind like evidence of a world that still believed in presents, in birthdays, in futures. The portrait painting still wet with space for the future—but what future? What space?

Others had decided that his own idea for population control—POP, he had termed it in his more lucid moments—had finally come to fruition. To behold him was to acquaint oneself with the awe of an agent entirely unaware of his own cover, a sleeper cell of one activated by forces he couldn't comprehend. The irony was exquisite: the writer, documenting the very conspiracy that had consumed his imagination, unaware that imagination and reality had merged into something far more terrifying than either alone.

Many had often cited his near addiction to filing reports, even when everyone at the Branch requested a stop—or at least a pause. The compulsion to document, to record, to bear witness, even when witnessing becomes complicity. But now the Cloud sector smiled at his determination and obviously enjoyed the picking apart of poems, stories, books from his dossier, which they kept in a gneiss structure about the size of an igloo with distinctive markings for each project. Art as intelligence, creativity as surveillance.

Of course, many of the staff hung around to download his music—which he presented without plan in measured doses to the public—a kind of sonic breadcrumb trail that attracted the attention of the pencil and button pushers, the bureaucrats of the apocalypse. One thing leads to another, as the song goes.

Another virus. Always another virus. The cycle of fear and control, refined to an art form.

## Chapter One Second Draft - The Apolitical Lie

*[An attempt to remove the political venom, but politics had already infected everything]*

He saw two lovely women sauntering under a single umbrella, their shared shelter a small rebellion against the coming storm. His gift wrap left behind—not abandoned, but transformed into something else, something that could no longer be contained by ribbons and paper. The portrait painting still wet with space for the future, brushstrokes of possibility bleeding into the uncertain canvas of tomorrow.

In the artistic rendition, there was no cover, no pretense. Three women from a portrait note, their names like incantations against the darkness:

Montserrat. Isabel. Licelot.

With more luck than talent, he had captured the setting he wanted to see, though seeing and understanding were different countries separated by an ocean of denial.

Meanwhile, back under the parasol, they were Asian. Most likely Korean. Maybe Chinese. In the age of manufactured hatred, the distinction mattered less than the fear they represented—or rather, the fear that had been carefully cultivated around them, like a garden of thorns.

A crimson red hair brush, two pearly laced hair pins, and the high-flying blood-colored rubber ball awaited his return. Objects that held more memory than the people who owned them, artifacts of a world that might not exist tomorrow.

It was Friday, the Friday before the lunar New Year. The turning of the calendar, the promise of renewal, the lie that time could heal what had been deliberately broken.

Some sort of spiritual sensation had thrilled him, and he was excited to once again fill empty pages with words—so much the better if they were poetry, those concentrated bullets of truth that could penetrate the armor of indifference.

The items in question were for a lady named Scarlet, though whether Scarlet was her real name or simply another mask in the masquerade of modern identity, he couldn't say.

He'd first met Scarlet while attempting to become friends with Faviola, as if friendship were a transaction, a negotiation, a careful dance around the minefield of human connection.

Simultaneously, he had secretly outlined a novel which he imagined calling Red White—this very novel, though he didn't yet understand that he was living inside it, that the boundaries between fiction and reality had dissolved like sugar in acid rain.

The opening chapter poured out of him easy as arrows from a steadfast arm, without over-aiming, without the paralysis of perfectionism. And yet he battled against his own intuition for days, even going so far as to attempt a rewrite, as if he could edit reality itself, revise the approaching catastrophe with better syntax.

Here, in this space between versions, he would swim in the infested waters of self-pity for a while, explaining the alleys and avenues of desolation and loneliness. The architecture of isolation, carefully constructed by forces that profited from human disconnection. To underline the need for companionship, for touch, for the basic human contact that was about to become a crime.

He'd settled for kind words and was remarkably at ease in his own company, though ease was a luxury that wouldn't survive the coming months.

Of course, there was Scarlet and Faviola... names like talismans against the approaching darkness.

Yet as he tried to come to terms with himself and his desires, a dream girl straddled him all the way into rapture—the last honest orgasm before the world went insane, the final moment of unmonitored pleasure.

Others would surely ask: was it true? Do you mean the blonde on the bed or the plan for population control? As if there were a difference, as if personal and political weren't two faces of the same coin, spinning in the air, waiting to land on either freedom or slavery.

The answer, like everything else, was about to become classified.
