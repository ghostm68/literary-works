# Chapter 28x: Chapter Twenty-Eight

## Etymology and Synchronicity: Pork to Porn

**1320**—that Poland reunification, first known use of the word *pork*. Poured question *porn*, nineteen sixties from *pornography* 1842...

A one hundred and twenty years abbreviation. Would this be deviation?

Still, what else takes a hundred and twenty years?

Don't Noah...Manischewitz...O pal, dear reader, how weird to wisdom or twig as it were, spontaneous ark in the middle of *gen* don't say it don't jinx it sidelines.

You will think no, he wink he eye planned annex fed, but not the case—really a synchronicity, truly.

Well, the words as at that point in the tail, he had no notion of how the annals would be shaved.

Sob ye heathens, sober he back to **Warsaw** to see if there be any further why or years!

What a fucking intro to a paragraph, he crowds himself with writerly tingle—note, perhaps rethink it as edit for chapter one.

## Roy, the Mayflower, and Jessica's Blood

Roy was his Burt name—not your narrator or writer but ear from before. Now then, the **Mayflower Autonomous Ship** sailed from Gdansk, yes, a modern craft four hundred pilgrim years in anniversary hull, the writer did cull.

*BTW, blood does not always squirt out when the head goes chopped—shopping, not to incriminate himself, still worth noting.*

Oh, to have something in common with Jessica!

*Co* trickled out, was or would be the phrase he might employ.

Yeah yeah, like who hasn't killed a cunt in the mall?

Hey ho, Judeo-Christian judgment, gotta go.

## Nut, Aleister, and the Pandemic Hermitage

*Co* type *Coco* meet **Nut**, the word fur crazy, yet daughter of shoe. *Nut*, deity of all skies, of uni-verse—yes only, not university.

*Nu* knew it. He always wondered why Aleister wrote it, no wing the knowing consequences, New Mexico.

Tell your ma, tell your pa, our love's a-goin' two grow, growl, howl...Frankenstein say relax don't do it, look at price Charlie paid Camilla companion to not attract attention—yesterday someone let infected hooker thru.

He saw the best minds of his generation **hibernating**, hounded by their own indoors, as long-time hermits felt the hurry-up-and-do-something fever rise from their desire to go "somewhere," anywhere, while the recluse considered, *Sure, but nothing has changed except now you get some idea of what it is like*.

There were few murders, outside of his own carved intentions in writing, but every Uber so often you could feel the bloodlust rising in the air against once-upon-time loved ones.

Possibly a pandemic cuts down other forms of human demise.

## T-Error-ism and Incest as Usual

Nobody was praying for corona virus cities or Nice Price Charlie in social media as would be the case at *tea error*—ahem, **t-error-mobile**, harrumph.

**T err oris m**...

At least not yet, and like usual, **incest raced around the clock** in *just this once* or *just the tip* or *a blow job is not sex* or *it will be safer up the ass* or *what is that perfume grandma sniff sniff* or *all right grandpa use your finger again* as the individual case might be.

As for work in progress reactions, the writer had not experienced such varying windows and doors. Lizard crawling entrance to cockroach sucking potato followed by solitary fly.

Sigh, why could it not hold back until final edit manuscript?

## Ms. Goo Avower, Weed, and Witchy Maintenance

Music, he motioned without mention—in love without men, in lust without semen—playing to practice dedication, faraway insemination.

Maybe his attempt was too intense with that Chinese name unsaid muse, but he saw at that point that even extreme reaching was not over the top given a worldwide quarantine.

Not alone yet alone—not with anybody, but anybody nearby could derail his next-to-her feeling.

He could get around **One-Eyed Lou**, but sometimes she could be manipulated into maintenance mayhem, it seemed. Ahem, sure, Amanda hates me, but maybe now that she's having a baby—oh Lord have mercy on the world—parenthesis, she will confirm the robot aspect he had been dealing with years gone by Bynes, but pod, possibly that was an argument for Twitter not text.

The ither other man da pit put placed war paint upon her fine features as Dakota—not Suspiria—continued to give battle although nobody was fighting her. You know, when an actor gets a motion to notion and there is no clipboard cut, well, it could take monkey sunset Gordon car DeMille OMG a donkey reading from the grass.

The only thing he wanted other than **Ms. Goo Avower** was weed, ruling out retirement in Japan.

*Itchy knee*, maybe full circle now from previous chapter to here, he notes.

*Witchy forehand my scratch how from devious trap to her nose he.*

## Editorial Notes:

**Pork/Porn Etymological Play**: The narrator traces a 120-year abbreviation from "pornography" (1842) to "porn" (1960s), linking it cryptically to Poland's 1320 reunification and the first known use of "pork." This conflation of meat, nation, and obscenity suggests a paranoid hermeneutics where language itself encodes violent historical cycles.

**Mayflower Autonomous Ship (2020)**: A real unmanned vessel that sailed from Plymouth, UK, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower voyage, recast here as departing from Gdansk (Poland), tying back to the Poland/pork thread and the narrator's obsession with maritime disaster and colonial violence.

**Jessica and Mall Murder**: Likely referencing a fictional or real violent act, the casual mention "like who hasn't killed a cunt in the mall?" normalizes extreme violence as part of the narrator's disintegrating moral landscape, reflecting his numbed response to both his own fantasies and pandemic-era societal breakdown.

**Nut (Egyptian Goddess)**: Sky goddess, mother of Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. Her invocation here blends with wordplay (co/Coco/nut) and Crowley references (Aleister), suggesting occult underpinnings to linguistic coincidence.

**Hibernating Best Minds**: Inverses Ginsberg's "Howl" ("I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness"), reframing pandemic lockdown as a reversal where hermits feel pressured to "do something" while the formerly active are forced into isolation—an ironic inversion of countercultural rebellion.

**T-Error-ism/Incest**: The narrator deconstructs "terrorism" into "t-error" (T-Mobile, tea, mistake) and conflates pandemic isolation with normalized family sexual abuse, suggesting lockdown conditions enable or expose ongoing domestic horrors.

**One-Eyed Lou / Amanda / Dakota**: The "witch" figure(s) in the narrator's domestic life—possibly multiple manifestations or split aspects of a single partner. "One-Eyed Lou" suggests both a physical description and a pirate/outlaw archetype. The pregnancy reference heightens the narrator's sense of entrapment and his dehumanization of women as "robots."

**Ms. Goo Avower**: The narrator's idealized, distant muse (likely Korean, given "itchy knee" = *ichi ni* = Japanese counting, but also "Kim Hee" references elsewhere), contrasted with the proximate "witch." She represents impossible romantic escape and artistic inspiration, fueling the manuscript even as she remains inaccessible.

**Itchy Knee Full Circle**: Refers back to earlier Japanese counting wordplay, suggesting the chapter loops back thematically to earlier obsessions with Asian muses, language games, and the narrator's fixation on cyclical time and historical repetition.

*Chapter 28 embeds paranoid etymology, pandemic hermitage, casual violence, occult references, and the narrator's ongoing triangulation between the proximate "witch," the idealized "Ms. Goo Avower," and his own decaying moral and linguistic coherence.*
