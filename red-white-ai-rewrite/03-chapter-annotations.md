# Annotations for Chapter Three

*Historical and cultural context for references in Chapter Three*

## 1. Euro Exchange Rate (2017)

The reference to "sterling at two against the euro" reflects the period around 2017 when the British pound fluctuated significantly against the euro following the Brexit referendum. In 2017, the GBP/EUR exchange rate ranged approximately from 1.06 to 1.19, meaning one pound bought roughly 1.06 to 1.19 euros—not quite "two against the euro" as mentioned in the text, but the narrator's economic anxiety and currency confusion reflect the broader uncertainty of the post-Brexit period. The pound had indeed weakened considerably from its pre-referendum highs of around 1.30+ euros per pound, making this a period of particular economic disorientation for UK residents.

## 2. South Korea's Rise Since the Korean War

The contrast between North and South Korea represents one of the most dramatic examples of divergent development in modern history. Following the Korean War armistice in 1953:

**South Korea's Economic Miracle:**
- Transformed from one of the world's poorest countries (GDP per capita lower than North Korea in the 1960s) to a prosperous democracy
- The "Miracle on the Han River" saw rapid industrialization from the 1960s-1990s
- Key factors included: export-oriented manufacturing, heavy investment in education, strategic government-business partnerships (chaebols), and significant US aid and military protection
- By 2017, South Korea was a technological powerhouse with global brands like Samsung, LG, and Hyundai
- Cultural soft power explosion through K-pop, Korean cinema, and television (Hallyu wave)

**North Korea's Isolation:**
- Remained under authoritarian communist rule with severe restrictions on movement and information
- Economy stagnated under central planning and international sanctions
- Nuclear weapons program became central to regime survival strategy
- Estimated GDP per capita in 2017: North Korea ~$1,700 vs South Korea ~$29,000

The "fireworks over a tall building" reference likely alludes to South Korea's New Year celebrations and modern skyline, symbolizing prosperity and openness versus North Korea's isolation.

## 3. Ian McKellen in "All Is True" and "The Good Liar"

**"All Is True" (2018):**
Directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh as William Shakespeare in his final years, this film explores the Bard's return to Stratford-upon-Avon after the Globe Theatre burns down. Ian McKellen plays the Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare's patron and rumored lover, in a performance that brings gravitas and subtle intimacy to the role. McKellen's portrayal emphasizes the complex relationship between artist and patron, touching on themes of loyalty, sexuality, and the cost of artistic genius. His scenes with Branagh crackle with unspoken history and mutual understanding between two masters of their craft.

**"The Good Liar" (2019):**
McKellen stars as Roy Courtnay, a sophisticated con artist who targets wealthy widow Betty McLeish (Helen Mirren) in what he believes will be his final, career-defining scam. McKellen's performance is a masterclass in deception and charm, showing his ability to make audiences simultaneously trust and distrust his character. The film becomes a cat-and-mouse game where McKellen's Roy believes he's the predator but may actually be the prey. His portrayal emphasizes the theatrical nature of deception—how a lifetime of performance can become indistinguishable from reality. The phrase "ticky boo" referenced in Chapter Three may echo McKellen's character's particular brand of English upper-class charm used to disarm his victims.

Both films showcase McKellen's ability to embody characters who blur the lines between performance and authenticity—a theme that resonates with the writer-narrator's own struggles with artistic honesty versus commercial necessity in Chapter Three.
