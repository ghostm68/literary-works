# Missing Chapters: 32, 33, 36

## Chapter 32 (Thirty-Two): Honeymoon, True Blood, HBO Loves Penis

It wasn't a honeymoon, yet the time needed some sort of stamp and for the love of Miss Goo Avower he engaged himself in the quest for a love song.

Of course, he was not a natural songwriter, only lucky with some dexterity in terms of guitar and nuance adaptations.

In a few days, he wroted and recorded **seven deadly sin songs**, five of them his own compositions. When was that? Sometime in April. Impressed by feeling that he had gained much in the practice of previous recordings, he carried on and even took the time to glance at **True Blood**.

Strangely it brought him memories of his own blood...distant azure kitchen Manhattan...not part of here...paper bag bandage.

Well, **HBO** was partly free and feeling that Miss Goo Avower would not mind his vampire enthusiasm, there you have it.

The rain meanwhile in witchland drenched everything and while she bit on his love genitals he said instead of asking her to stop knowing it would be futile: **how HBO loved penis**.

A blatant love he means—he thought his sister loved dick but **HBO took the cake**. How many boy parts had we seen via Home Box Office? She finally unclenched her evil little teeth and smiled, giving him the finger. *All right that is true.*

*Do you think Bush had seen this...how am I ever going to look Laura in the eye?* he pondered.

Well, Texas was long way away...and most likely there was no need to worry.

As parks were turned into burial sites, all he wanted was his pact with the Goo Avower and of course not to piss off the witch too much.

## Chapter 33 (Thirty-Three): Easter Door, Dis Pater, Easter Track

During the days of **Easter**, he kept seeing his handmade door. It was a known fact that somehow escaped his waking mind.

He remembered being certain that placing a chain around a hanger hanging in a closet and pulling said chain through the wall and into the removed handle with a master lock would not only serve for an entrance but also protect a specific girl which he had been concerned with at the time.

Still, why had he not thought of it before, all these years...he had kept the keys to the lock and been in contact with it since. Somehow it was only now that it crossed his mind.

In a dream **Kenzie** was dressing in a much larger room and he was there. She, a woman of faith, could have held some sort of reasonable conversation over his concern with more ancient spaces.

The translation of **Dis Pater** from the Celt which to him sounded awful similar in some eerie tone to **Dios Padre** as the spics enjoyed saying.

One of the ancient gods, he felt, had contacted him directly and he responded as best he could understanding that although time itself might be irrelevant to these deities there might still be a lingering need for mortal recognition ever since the shift which brought a goodly majority of the population into the hands of Judeo-Christian-Muslim-Buddhism and or apathy.

It was then that after a fair amount of struggle the recording process took a significant turn and listening to his **Easter track** he knew that rarely had any guitar sounded so groovy in all of modern recorded music.

It was, even if he sounded egomaniacal, thrilling—like discovering some sort of magic recipe.

He had to, of course, give due credit to the witch for it was she that made him burn in such a way that it drove him directly into creation. A chain reaction as he waited upon Miss Goo Avower.

That sort of temperature rise ride he had only encountered with **Alyssa** years ago before she said *I'll kick your dick so hard you won't be able to have babies*.

---

The music, he decided, placed his wife in a category that went beyond any other songs wroted for any Goo Avower before her. Well, he did think there was one in terms of music and he covered it to leave no arguments.

Her love or his idea of her love held an inspiration that dwarfed any other he had known in terms of rock and roll.

He lamented his lonesome and jaded with suspicion state and the awful fact that even in marriage he constantly pushed her away from his true feeling which was utterly overwhelmed by her.

**Too much hurt makes a man hate and the loathing feeds itself by holding back love even as inspiration gushes forth in ways so unexpected the casual observer might use the term genius although he would readily admit only to some talent in poetry and rhythm where the real genius was her.**

He told her once she made him believe in some sort of perfection and some of the new songs proved this truth. She did not respond but the witch did soon after say *well I'm not perfect* as if to imply a continuation of the rivalry.

He awoke and made love to Miss Goo Avower with the shadow of the witch hovering over his desire but when the music played in his mind at a kiss or cuddle there was only them.

Drifting into other dreams after sex he found himself speaking of a farm to his lost aunt who sat in the lost apartment with her daughter on the faux leather west town house sofa bed.

Still he loved Miss Goo Avower more even if he could only say his adoration in songs.

## Chapter 36 (Thirty-Six): Notes, Slave Owners, DAW Conundrum, Lakers and Kobe's Widow

**Notes:**

Jealous slut type quote dick eating animals quoting the bible. Hymn him song lyric. The witch now holy. The duck named mouse, wanted.

Sixty two Indo area code 812 3821 0757. Gentlemen, that is a phone number! Well, not her number but it is in the general vicinity.

All right point proven these humans will follow orders even ridiculous mandates if the body count adds up like an action movie.

There is gossip that Ms. Goo Avower had a past psst Arab hotel pebbles bam bam. He won't hear of it—*pussy whipped*—says he will fill the paragraph with phone numbers...turn you all into telemarketers.

Looked up his ancestors, **slave owners** some of them still and figures to propose handing out forty acres and mopeds instead of mules if only the descendants will return to service. *If my great granddaddy bought the Williams well that included testicles and by natural consequence offspring.* Figures he'd have a whole damn town.

What can we say? People are going with the plan but they might cringe or recoil from the bring slavery back stance. *Shoot, all right to help with quarantine we can call it human appliance flesh, a novel hands-on approach to indoor servants.*

Denturist kills sixteen in Nova Scotia...dressed like a cop. Manchester police: *Well son we can make up any story to hold you in detention.*

**Lakers** fighting over dripping widow vagina one even sent flowers. Jealous slut contacts attorney, she will drain the entire team.

**Notes 2:**

Upon counting **nineteen original new songs inspired by Ms. Goo Avower** he sighed *we smoked them* as he browsed the current playlist sure the Stones came near yet the harmonica haunted the track which otherwise would have been an addition to their late seventies or early eighties work he thought it should have been a sax. Meanwhile Dylan had two but both were more recital than song all would agree.

A chapter should be added by way of explanations. Nevermind, **DAW** is software multitrack. None of them perfect. He let it go after hours of this or that.

The day dragged on and ended with him nearly crushing a pigeon perched at his window. The fluttery shriek and realization then stick to sway away. Poor bird.

Smokes coffee *oh mister Jeffries the shit came out my ass...and landed on the wall*. Like a Pink Floyd brick yet exactly from where he had no clue as he was forced to wipe more than his buttocks. The wall in front no less, ghost glob. Beyond weird...does a monkey throw shit asked the radio station all right but which ape?

It was a hot day the city filled with smoke from the government burning trash they can no longer dump in the ocean. All he wanted was her and some rest well food too...but not fish.

In all **twenty-nine songs from the last day of March until 27 or 28 April**. The fact should speak volumes in praise of Miss Goo Avower and his desire to give back to his lunatic fringe.

**Notes 3:**

Dreams found him in a sleepover, he had refused to surrender to sexual desire for fear of illusion. He was willing to wait. Then suddenly a typical Los Angeles gathering. Nobody he liked except **SG**. So nice she seemed until semen. He lay before her naked covering his erection with both hands. You know the supernatural hard on. Then awake feeling an orgasm without touch.

It was a hell of a fight, not the DAW but when the horny **Lakers** realized that the widow had a few other female children which meant that pussy could in a few years be doubled or tripled. Step father sex masturbation ensued. *Yo they light skinned too.* *Fuck that why wait they could suck lick the tip in the meanwhile.* Bedtime stories. Even her sister Sophie felt the pull of that strange manly desire.

## Editorial Notes:

**Seven Deadly Sin Songs**: The narrator composed seven songs in April 2020 during pandemic lockdown, five original compositions inspired by Miss Goo Avower, framed as penance/devotion through the seven deadly sins.

**HBO Loves Penis**: Running joke throughout manuscript that HBO programming features excessive male nudity, culminating in True Blood vampire oral sex scene. Sister/witch "loves dick" but "HBO took the cake."

**Dis Pater / Dios Padre**: Celtic god of the underworld (Dis Pater) phonetically similar to Spanish "God Father" (Dios Padre)—narrator contacted by ancient deity during Easter, leading to breakthrough guitar recording.

**Easter Track Magic Recipe**: After appeasing Dis Pater, narrator achieves perfect guitar tone, "rarely had any guitar sounded so groovy in all of modern recorded music"—egomaniacal claim of divine artistic intervention.

**Alyssa's Threat**: Ex-girlfriend threatened to kick narrator's genitals to cause infertility—parallel to witch's genital biting in Chapter 32.

**Slave Owner Ancestors / Human Appliance Flesh**: Narrator researched genealogy, discovered slave-owning ancestors, proposes reinstating slavery as "human appliance flesh" with "forty acres and mopeds" compensation—satirical provocation or sincere proposal unclear.

**Lakers / Kobe's Widow**: Post-Kobe Bryant death (Jan 2020), Lakers players allegedly pursuing Vanessa Bryant sexually, sending flowers. "Jealous slut" attorney will "drain entire team"—misogynistic conspiracy theory.

**29 Songs in One Month**: Narrator claims to have written 29 original songs March 27-April 28, 2020, all inspired by Miss Goo Avower—manic creative output during early pandemic.

**DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) Conundrum**: Extended technical rant about music production software, evaluating multiple DAWs, settling on Acid after rejecting others for spyware, limitations, or "bad names."

*Chapters 32, 33, and 36 document the narrator's pandemic creative explosion (29 songs in one month), Easter divine intervention via Dis Pater producing perfect guitar tone, HBO's penis obsession, slave ancestry fantasies, and Lakers pursuing Kobe's widow, all while navigating witch/muse rivalries and DAW software hell.*
