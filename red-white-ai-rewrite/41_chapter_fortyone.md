# Chapter 41: Chapter Forty-One

## Love Poem and Ms. Finninjer

*When love is around, it tends to surround.  
A gentle touch alone could itself astound.  
For him it was always in women he found.  
They led to lyrical songs with his guitar sound.*

Beyond what he had heard, another report called the still-throbbing deadly weekend toll **astronomical**.

He did not need to be proven right, some things are simply palpable. Perhaps it was over—he hoped, awaking to a bizarre segment on the tele (nowadays without tubes in case you happened to arrive from the middle of the previous century) with **Elmo**, which made him stumble in memory along the lines of *he told her he loved her and then he killed her*, followed by leaving to shop for a *Tickle Me Elmo* doll...paraphrase of long-past events recorded in another manuscript.

Point being it led him away from the very vivid dream he was longing to examine.

## Cold Hands Dream

Some sort of department store—what is he doing there in the bright fragrant glow of displays, mirrors, mannequins, and the slippery floor as shimmery as the sky? Perhaps only to see her—unknown her, blonde her, not much makeup on her face, it seemed. Then sitting facing each other after a few words and she held out her hands, pale and gentle as if they belonged to someone else, a stolen treasure she held with cool confidence, passing them off as her own. And then holding them—not in a shake, not in a squeeze, but in some sort of feel, neither fake nor forceful—he realized they were unlike the usual temperate flesh. They were well below normal degrees, a **manifestation of the devil**, he considered, while recalling the song line: *for his hands are so cold*. And later, as he typed, the Irish: *I have held the hand of the devil*, except in that version they were warm and the narrator was cold as a stone.

He was reluctant to add any more characters to the now nearly impossible-to-edit tome which this had become. Not for nothing did folks speak of attention span—most recently **IA the VG**—yet he could blame it on **Miss Goo Avower** for posting the long fingers painted upon a door as if trying, vying to outdo the witch and her extreme green nail post.

Hmm, nails and fingers followed by a dream of icy hands leads him to have to mention **Ms. Finninjer**.

## Ms. Finninjer: Arizona to Van Life

Eighteen years old, intent on being a model, but that is no easy task coming out of the Arizona heat. She dedicated her Instagram to varying styles of makeup but left after turning sixteen—a drastic inclination not inclined to looking back.

She had traveled to New York City and Rome, even producing YouTube videos to share with the world, but pretty much left that platform after turning seventeen—a drastic inclination intent not on what was but what will be.

It was time for college, for the big town...Los Angeles, UCLA perhaps. She got a roommate in order to afford the lifestyle, but as much as one beats the drum that men and women can be friends, the line tends to blur via touch or proximity.

She tried again with a model in keeping with her own desires, but as hard as it is living with a man, it is sometimes worse with a woman.

Finally, using the word with a casual definition, she rented her own space only to find that any type of regular job would not cover that type of expense, at least not for the long run—or to but it bluntly, Cheetos while filling tend to keep one awake at night hoping for another meal.

College became impossible due to the pandemic and possibly the writer's attempt at reality fiction, which led her to two rather questionable choices: online classes and the purchase of a **Volkswagen van** which she might make her residence.

She did, with her drastic inclinations at their most extreme, which is where he found her and led to his pleading for her safety and salvation as well as the start of this chapter and possibly that dream.

## Yellow Frogs, Gina, Kellyanne Conway's Daughter

It was hot—not 112 Tucson heat yet still too hot to mention—and **yellow frogs** were in the news. He had not seen yellow frogs. Browsing lightly, he remembered it might have mentioned that they turn that color during mating season to attract other frogs.

He raced to message **Gina**, not mentioned herein since the escapade scene driveaway attempt which he himself can only vaguely distill without going back to glance—which he won't do at this point so as not to get caught up in a style which might not be in sync with his present emotion.

Pre-set emotions—they are there, all prepared to march themselves through the mind or even manifest in talk or action. Of course he does it—all writers do it—but for him it has to be before the typing starts.

This burning cannot be, for various reasons that turning.

In the vagueness there was possibly a song he had in mind—not like now, his own composition, free of the manipulative influence, devoid of the haunted echo that seems to flourish from internet trackers intent on the insight of browsing history.

Why is he thinking of **Kellyanne Conway's daughter Claudia** in the middle of the night? Because he happened to click on a story and the link remained there on Safari where someone attempted to pick up the thread of his quotation marks—thinking *end quotation marks, step in, replace, pretend, and repeat*.

He slides through the history page clearing the last hour and day in case there is something he wants to revisit later, yet the link returns as if regurgitating itself—and so clear all, open, close—still there, just that one, but why? Open, close, alright, finally gone.

At a certain stature, everything one does on that level pours in scrutiny.

## Brim Was Better

Cut in from agency—no urgency, no deadline: *Now this book, we really like this one with so much to pick and pull apart.*

He is adamant: **Brim was better**—with the extended quotes woven invisible to allow the reader to flex their literary and song memory at the same time, poking a dry penis right into the eye of the many hack plagiarists, plus an almost concise plot with highly interesting subplots, not to mention the exonerations. No ma'am, it was a highpoint. And this? Well, it might yet be a demonstration of determination, but is that truly a book? He could not respond to his own quasi-doubt—only in the editing stage could he know if it would hold.

He held her hand wholly, not certain of who she was or might be. He held her hand and then he awoke.

*Chapter 41 introduces Ms. Finninjer (18, van-dwelling model fleeing pandemic LA), cold-hands dream devil, yellow frogs, Gina, Kellyanne Conway's daughter as internet surveillance target, and the narrator's assertion that his previous manuscript (Brim) was superior to Red White.*
