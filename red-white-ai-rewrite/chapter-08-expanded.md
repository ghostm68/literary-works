# Chapter Eight (Expanded)

---

**Julia Kim** (sharp Korean features, high cheekbones, small round glasses perched on her nose, straight black hair cut in a severe bob, lips always painted dark red) said it was Cummings.

And so the writer was reminded of E.E.—

*nobody, not even the rain, has such small deadly hands.*

If memory serves, people were dropping like flies in Wuhan and points continental.

*Is the Lincoln better than the Cadillac?* He's cheap, she said, and used to ride the subway.

Even the hospital director went down to his grave. Some said it was the chorus: *COVID-19*. Others claimed it was the two rich Jews trying to gain the nomination for president, like a pastime either of them should have, at that point, already surmised.

In America, there is no real anti-semi-truck height, but there is also nothing against hating the Heeb.

Two other people talked about how milk was delivered, seemingly in a live trance broadcast from the land of sudden sex tape.

Mayor Masturbation. But what else is a mayor to do?

One of the high-profile Jews went bowling with his opponent's ass, once upon a time, circa the end of *Anal Love TV*. Motor-pussy women and big-dick men. What was it? Mojo. Nobody had a job in that glorious time on Planet Earth.

*Cummings,* was it, said **Kim Julia** (or **Julia Kim**—sometimes she reversed it, depending on her mood, her identity shifting like a quantum state). Half of what I say is song lyrics.

The writer held a good-enough chair at the Rock Star Round Table and delivered a single to a decentralized platform.

*Wanted Man*, a cover. What did men want? Sure, mass extermination and control of India and Afrikkka—but not if it meant losing revenue.

Dear holy Saint Judas—hold on, is Judas a saint? Thirty times a Jew. Jesus would know. Pound would say: wounded, part of the process.

He married **Faviola** (caramel skin glowing in the Wuhan hotel light, dark eyes soft with exhaustion and love, fingers trailing across his chest) and tattooed her initials in letter form.

**Jessica** (olive-skinned, eyes still wild from the supermarket murder, blood long washed away but the memory of it clinging to her like perfume) wanted to kill her, but agreed that her taste in accessories was impeccable.

At the crossroads of what to do, someone came up with the brilliant idea of using cryptocurrency to balance the books.

At the start, to get things good and tidy, an exchange was closed. A hundred million plus, no refund in sight—meant more time to reel in the mining process and spread goodwill, or at least face masks, among the target group selected for extermination. F-coin up the ass of holders.

**Anyelina** (fuller-figured Hernandez woman, dark hair cascading over her shoulders, hands perpetually restless, jealousy flickering in her brown eyes like candlelight) was exhausted and jealous on one occasion. It was then that the writer was again confounded by the nature of fidelity.

Partly, it was all he wanted. But did it really mean turning one's back to another sweetheart?

Well, you can't ride no two mules with one behind.

Moooool. Time-zone impaired. We, the creators.

Could it be that one could only have one friend? Or, in the case of creativity—no friends?

Like the Jews: keep to themselves and put the N-word clowns out front in fancy sneakers and chains. *Go ahead, get yourselves a little WASP woman or a señorita. Live it up like the white man. We'll be over here laughing at you.*

For ourselves? Ike? We like the submissively quiet nature of the Asian hot boxes. Besides, there's enough of them to go around.

*Cummings,* said **Julia Kim**.

The writer adored the newfound tranquility of Wuhan, even if people had stopped fucking outside. Well, also difficult to fornicate when dearly deep art departed, the dead play *Eyes of the World*.

When the postcard came—announcing the **Lady of Black Sparrow's** visit—the writer-cum-rock-star was pleasantly surprised.

She (tall, regal, dark-skinned, wearing flowing robes that seemed to shimmer with ink-black feathers, eyes ancient and knowing) had the type of smile that contained itself in a clench, yet a joy nearly religious seeped through—like liquid in a heavily pregnant woman's panties.

What was it? Oh yes. At least one correction for Chapter 7 notes: the nephew did not really give birth to a bed, but rather a billfold. Or wallet!

The NSA was so displeased with the New Jersey squadron that they took over the writer-cum-rock-star: *In that we now possess you. Control. Invisible drone machine. And even if he yells, 'Mo Green! Dammit, I'm Mo Gree—' then shoot out an eye to get full attention. Do the work, or we will all be forced to strap on diapers. We know you are a Republican, but the Democrats would have had these fools executed before you even knew about it. What kind of family tries to turn someone into a fucking wallet?*

And so it was, without reminding anyone of the Clinton body count, which stretched back to JFK witnesses: space, the final frontier. Enigma in a riddle. *Jimmy gotta go, huff and puff, Hoffa, flash in the pan, nap, frying, snap—pubic hair—the sound of Hernandez: 'Next time, I'm really cutting it off.'*

He has to hold on to these moments, nearly three years ago, because on the phone with **Elton** (British accent crackling through the line, voice tinged with melancholy and champagne), he echoed: *Never did I ever win the Oscar.*

Looking out onto desolate Wuhan avenues, perplexed—having grown up in what some called Hymietown—at the lack of Jews.

Then embraced him, long distance, wishing a tour with **Eminem** would leg, but he retired like he planned, and made love to **Faviola** until love made him fall hard asleep.

*Cummings,* **Julia Kim** had claimed. But without much of anything, you could still convince the world it was—or had been—the Heebs. Of course, back then, with the couple of Jew-million or billionaires running for nominational support, well, good ol' America was far from helping any sort of rational argument. Far and wee, see? Sí, sister. There it were. Stop and frisk himself against: *I'm not made of(f) Hillary burning.* Hilarious—if one had that last straining remnant of laughter remaining, which, of course, given the state of affairs and scissors (no reference to lesbians, obviously), was not surviving with any sort of coherent satisfaction. Funny, yes. But then—fuck—it's true. Or too. Water-well deep, close to a truth. Waddaya think? Is it safe to giggle, or do we go out, riot, and maybe burn copies of *Red White*? Darn, that would be Nazi shit.

The Germans defecated in their trousers. *Jews and Chinese? Well, mein lo mein—they been getting together for Yeats, years now,* **Julia** said. Ah.

Ooh, he thought. There was something removed. And read, reread—alike a proofreader—but found no solution to it. Evolution. Still notes. Why worry?

Well, **Paul** (pale, bloated face, eyes vacant, a noose still metaphorically around his neck even in memory) in his momma's house, hung. All the sandwiches could not put Humpty Dumpty back on the force. Stream of interruption. The some-of-sum staggers into a slow-motion fade.

**Hernandez** (dark eyes blazing with possessive fury, nails painted blood-red this time, voice sharp as broken glass) to the **Bali witch** (wrinkled, ancient, one milky eye, teeth filed to points, monkey perched on her shoulder chittering in demonic tongues) with monkey overhead, and the slit spirit of **Kahlo** (unibrow, painted lips, pain radiating from her like heat from a furnace) feeding her haters pain: *Here, I have his pubic hair, and I don't want his penis hard for anyone but me.*

Raised eyebrow. Pause.

*Well, all right. Us. I mean, it was me that brought the ingredient.*

The witch then asked: *Who is Julia Kim?*
