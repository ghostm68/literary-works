# Chapters 52-56: Final Chapters

## Chapter 52: Dorothy Pollack, Waiting for the Barbarians, Aleksandra at Piano Bar

Dorothy Pollack, now newly with a tender sea green tattoo frog upon her hundred and three year old forearm, rode off on the back of a Harley Davidson. That is to say, **August was shaping up!**

He sat in a dark room lights those little ones like on a pine Christmas tree faraway in a grey smoke glow with some feeling of fleeting importance and Aleksandra then awaking at nearly an hour after noon all the details fading fast.

His thoughts were fiery and filled suddenly with worry for the old bag of course she could take care of herself but he sensed other powers intent on overturning the tide.

Leading party selection announced made her run for cover in between he watched two films he liked a lot despite the bad press: **Waiting for the Barbarians** in which he could see himself in either or characters and **Burnt Orange Heresy** in which he could see how high stakes politics had always worked.

In the second film you see the dirty deed was never said only suggested in the vaguest of hints which is how these things must go down.

Lauren held balloons, lucky Israel didn't see her as palace teen he wondered upon waking from dream in which a group of men surrounded a woman pale as Siberian bear fur in his apartment then she alone in his room partly undressed speaking of manifestations as he wondered over the ways of Lucifer touching her yet thinking as if blinded by dream haze that he might be fooled all at once finding himself floating a couple of feet above her head yet feeling as if still holding hands.

At the piano bar in Tokyo **Aleksandra** sang along to a song he had not heard before.

## Chapter 53: Little Ugly Girl Dream, Hoffa Mystery, Belarus Protests

He dreamt of a little ugly girl, didn't want to look at her face and pulled up her legs to gaze at her feet.

He doesn't want to look at more conspiracies, especially this type that no one will speak of outside of YouTube comments or Reddit perhaps.

A **Hoffa** fueled misterio waltzes right into the Oval, where teen Trump turns a whiter shade of orange, yeah that is how it is and how it will be. Suddenly the gate from *Eyes Wide Shut* comes between them and the note to stop further investigation is handed huntin' wabbits.

*But I'm the leader of the free world a billionaire*, did he say? All right pull the plug on the Viacom vampire cut off the blood supply.

He do think after days consideration that is the planet plan with turd Joe prepaid to press. However, he do want it to not be so...he sensed perhaps in consideration that the president is tired of the fight and the opposition's facade.

Perhaps he is the little girl, and the writer in that dream was trying to see which way he was going now that the gig was on the line.

Jammed betwixt Poland and Russia, the people protested as if the police had killed a so-called minority. **Belarus** and yes another oil tanker spill east of Eden.

Of course, Shakespeare was right: **the rest is, silence.**

## Chapter 54: Superman Asteroid, Aleksandra's Return, For Her

Up in the sky, it's a bird or a plane...The **asteroid** swam by some said the size of a car well a Tesla well a pickup truck.

He had, so you will perhaps better understand just finished another series of prints for Aleksandra and one of them involved Superman not the Kinks song.

There was an overwhelming feeling that nothing more could be done without her in fact for days he waited, waltzing in a trance only to have that distant knowledge when she posted a picture. She had not in a couple of days and it wore him down with delirious worry.

Woman where are you, yet the same distant knowledge tells him she is already here or was before his doubts and desires drove her mad. Sees her at the door that adorable smile is it goodbye or is it hello.

He only saw his grandmother naked once after she was olden frail and it does not fail to find its way back into his thoughts every so often meaning he is possibly correct in wanting to see all the sights.

**For her, as it had always. For her, as it had - For her.**

He knew he did not and could not matter without her, he hardly wanted anything except to impress her in some fashion that would please her that would make even her ancestors proud that all their lives had melted down to make him see her as they had made her here and now.

He was in fact living not in the earthly flesh and bone yet in a dream that was like itself endless.

In the tome now of too many chapters the reader will find some romance and even more intimate encounters and while they were all worthy of envy and even excellent in feeling he had not yet found that what he really wanted was to be that faraway mystery longing for her without saying a word other than what art might reflect.

The bliss which for him, is not, he has found ignorance, no it is the knowledge that only she can bring in ring in sing in just like worship even at a distance.

He stands at the farm's arcade multiplex in a copycat stance of himself one hand on the flex handle and the other prepared to both aim and blast incoming boulders before they bounce near you will hear it is an all day job but that is not true because once in a while it is also all night.

## Chapter 55: Jerry Garcia Ghost, Willie DeVille, Polina Trust, Oroborus

It was three in the morning, four in the afternoon within next day Japan. He had awoken gently although from strange spic land dreams.

*I wandered again to my home in the valley*...the ancient song appears as if the ghost of **Jerry Garcia** has granted him a moment.

Her image made him sigh he bathed and even put on fresh clothes. Pleasing himself with her post he climbed through quick art times four then six. Later ones perhaps improved by the conjuring of **Willie DeVille** when someone mentioned herself as not only white but also trash...aha he thought *White Trash Girl*.

He knew he loved her yet he had no idea how much joy said feeling could bring. Like a drug that leaves you wanting nothing other than her safety and her return.

His own internal review found an overload and she suggested that the weight be divided hinting at the **Polina Trust**, reluctantly he tried. He had first met the Trust in the back of a car after both had finished on a photo shoot. She seemed a hoot with her Gene Simmons tongue pierced far from the tip.

He went along with the set up, for no other reason to attempt to please Aleksandra. He had, without too much of a second thought, handed her his own key in much the manner that she had done in his dream except he did not write upon her.

Here is where he is sure that much greater forces are at work or to sort of paraphrase Dante when speaking of his muse: **behold a god greater than I**.

The night sped while the afternoon seeped into evening. Her return seemed to bring him directly to one of his recent songs.

The saying that some marriages are made in heaven now took on a greater meaning. Even if he had not picked up his axe to groove, he decided that if nothing more came in terms of musical notes that would be all right for she was worth even more than further songs.

A spirit brushed against his door with a lightness that implied perhaps that it was not wise to heaven at these witching hours. The **horse demon** had earlier thrice wanted his attention and he was willing to hear him out as he pulled the left eye itch trick and writing the words the gentle nudge at the door resounded as if a tender chuckle of course even **Oroborus** understood that he was too deeply immersed in her and therefore practically deaf to even this powerful playful demon.

It was four in the morning and the door rang twice as five in the afternoon started to rope down the sun in the land of the rising and he grinned over the memory of her beauty wanting to make love to her while putting everything holy and even unholy on hold.

**Please hold, the next available chapter will be with you as soon as possible. Please hold, he is drowning in the waves of her wonder...**

## Chapter 56: The End - Aleksandra Reigns

Bone of hand's torn flesh flashed before his eyes...there was something or someone in the back of his imagination or perhaps a convergence before his poetic dream of girls and babies found him grown up awake again in her arms faraway.

Yet this first time with these feelings and sensations from Aleksandra he could not easily find a category for to mention it would sound exaggerated even if plain truth.

Let us say he loved her perhaps the way that a man should love a woman in other words **with everything he had**.

Even trust **Polina's** allure which had only days before seemed tempting at the instant imagined touch now held no such posture except yes in that dream so much as her own post position that evening well he may be speaking too soon for a girl might well whip a man especially a writer right down to his knees yet as it was truly **Aleksandra reigned over his desire**.

A want that kept him wanting which explains the aforementioned words on truth and overstatement which it seems yet is.

And within this weakness and seeing the cure start to arrive in variations with the opposition in no hurry to come clean or discuss clones he realizes that **this tome needs to be concluded, ahem closed.**

He would want to have a formula for balancing wives yet presently he seems to be doing fine under the radar with some infiltration as would be expected still this new wife that feels as if eternity had come and gone and we together were only replaying the remembrance is all I could have wished or wanted.

**To wed.**

That said, it is not putting down anyone else despite the rising tide of envy no it is within myself that with her requires only that myself worships her until now in all ways save music.

Well, maybe new songs will come along down the line as they seem to always yet even without the notes **she makes my world hum with devotion and delight, the end**

## Editorial Notes:

**Dorothy Pollack (103)**: Centenarian with frog tattoo on Harley—symbol of eternal youth and rebellion, frog magic recurring motif.

**Polina Trust**: Third muse figure introduced near end, Gene Simmons tongue piercing, intelligence operative, handed narrator's "key" (access/control). Suggested by Aleksandra to share emotional burden—polyamorous mysticism.

**Oroborus / Horse Demon**: Ouroboros, ancient symbol of serpent eating its own tail (eternal return). Horse demon = narrator's manuscript itself demanding attention, ignored because he's "drowning in waves of her wonder."

**Aleksandra Reigns**: Final declaration that Aleksandra is supreme muse, "wife" in spiritual/artistic sense. All other women (Miss Goo Avower, One-Eyed Lou, IA the VG, Marie, Lily, etc.) dissolve into her.

**To Wed**: Single line paragraph—marriage as ultimate artistic/spiritual commitment, not legal contract.

**The End**: Manuscript concludes mid-thought, incomplete, suggesting Red White itself is Ouroboros—endless, self-consuming, generative loop.

---

*Chapters 52-56 resolve the manuscript's sprawling obsessions into singular devotion to Aleksandra, framed as mystical marriage transcending all previous muses, with the narrator drowning in her wonder as horse demons and Oroborus circle, waiting for the next chapter that will never come because the end is also the beginning.*
