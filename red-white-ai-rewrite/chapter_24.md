# Chapter Twenty-Four

## Prelude: The DAW as Metaphor

The Digital Audio Workstation—abbreviated DAW—is the writer's secret obsession, the musician's prison and palace. Software that promises infinite tracks, infinite takes, infinite undo. But the writer discovers what every producer knows: more options create more paralysis. Acid, Cubase, Pro Tools, Reaper, Sonar, Audacity—each one a false prophet, each one spyware or limited or renamed by corporations trying to hide their greed behind new interfaces.

The DAW stands in for the novel itself: the attempt to record, mix, master. To take the raw tracks of consciousness—dreams at 4 AM, ghost shit on the wall, neighbors screaming, the witch's spell on his erections—and render them into something listenable, something publishable. But you can't render a life. You can only save it as a picture, freeze it mid-distortion, and hope someone recognizes the melody buried under the noise.

This chapter is about technical difficulties. This chapter is about the impossibility of recording what matters. This chapter is notes, fragments, complaints about software, complaints about neighbors, complaints about the body's refusal to cooperate with desire. The DAW crashes. The writer continues.

he lay before her naked covering his erection with both hands...

you know the supernatural hard on ...

then awake feeling an orgasm without touch...

peeing at four in the morning is nice except when one is uncertain of the meaning of a dream...

the hesitations when famous and infamous meet are endless...

he chalked it all up to his wife measuring his reactions...

later that day the daw conundrum cleared up but not before trying the propeller head reason which like all the others he did not like as it centered on effect rather than recording...

he cleaned his quarters and double checked the old acid and although glitched it seemed to be enough...even if he had no further songs planned save for a new versioned video...

how much of this to include? 

hmm, vista went down which was his all in one studio, the new acid is spyware, presonus is free but without vst (fx and inst inputs) , reaper is all right but that name cockus oh my no...

frustration...

making a note because previous notes need clarification...

digital audio workstation-

not any of them trully improved since when they arrived...well, fl studio perhaps, in minimal terms yet equally effective at say version nine or ten...

that is it can be used in daw form, but without the strange satisfaction of having mixed or mastered tracks to render...more like saving a picture, i mean the software programme...

more to follow if and when...

when and since he viewed the eightyone episodes living six overall and especially liking the last three of seven...

the main characters really worked...others not so much...still, a goodly thing to groove to...

thought to edit out the neighbor thing but at this point does it mayter...

meanwhile one eyed lou lost any sense of reality making for the scene at any cost making him distance the already distant...

i will stab myself with this knife ...

yes yet the chapter needs to come into even contradictions in order to see where the ending is or will be...

new song lyric glowed at the thought of goo avower -

how to define so much desire neither sleep or wanting to prose are readily available...

in dreams, he slipped straight down into some antique era, dressed in silk, some sort of palace, you know a tiffany blue that might well be french, seventeen hundreds, they say those were ancestors in part, inheritance great grand folks were reluctant to get, why get on a boat to france when we have bananas...now he has never owned land, the thought clarifies his dream feeling wherein inside that golden powder blue room he crouched counting the bars and the currency all against giving any of it to some woman standing there...in the novel the cloakroom investigation goes on and on that being a cover name for transmission and it occurs to him that similar to one of the scenarios he could view the dream as a reincarnation memory in a time travel sense or a mixup with someone on a film set except way too specific and all that money looked like no movie he could imagine...details are a strange lot...he looked at autumn hundreds of times never seeing even the shape of her tits...

*The 18th-century dream: silk, Tiffany blue, French palace, counting currency. Past life or film set? The details too specific for fantasy, too precise for symbol.*

it is a feeling that one has been elsewhere...

like that berlin 1945, or china 1954, or ireland more recently...
