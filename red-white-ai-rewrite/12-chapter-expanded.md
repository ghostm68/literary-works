# Chapter Twelve (Expanded)

*We can't let these folks simply lounge around. People need to work.*

*They will start calling them concentration camps—*

*No, no. Work camps. Like, for sure, quarantine activities. Hell, we get it well enough—they will be dying to get in.*

*Not fucking funny.*

*Hahaha...*

He ain't rubber or metal. He's a pure-breed Puritan racist—and over what? A murder!

*Who hasn't killed some bitch in the park?*

He needs to get his priorities straight. The nephew was counting on the wallet for a Porsche—a sort of upgrade.

People are all the same. They hate other people.

*But what will happen to a great percentage of professional sports, contemporary music, and janitorial services?*

*You don't think he's planning on making us watch women's golf while listening to Lawrence Welk and having Ukrainians throw out the trash?*

The writer mentions no plan, outline. He is thinking, however: the tables need to be turned, and everyone rocking daily pairs of expensive kicks needs to be frightened with the same fear we all understand.

*Lookit, we done it to other colored folks beforehand—meaning redskin-scalpin' injuns—so what is a few million more coolies, ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, Dominicans, Haitians? Hey, when is one of those sides going to grow some balls and stop time-sharing the island? Oh, right. Invisible slave system in place. Play ball, everybody—but not you, from Port-au-Princess.*

*OK, maybe not the Mexicans. It's too complicated, and we might need another boat into Cubanese in order to take over the cigar-singar factories.*

*Meanwhile, what is the slowdown on production? At this rate, it will take a dozen years, toggle, to get the Chinese back to pure-breed category.*

*Should have got more Germans involved. Hell, they could have made socialism work in the East once upon a time. But those Russians—one taste of that fine Germanic pussy? Well, who can think straight after that?*

Secret weapon of the downfall of the Soviet You-Knee-On: **Bavarian bitches** (blonde, blue-eyed, porcelain skin, bodies sculpted by alpine genetics and beer-hall discipline) so tight they could have made snitches of all of Putin's men.

*When in Rome—so, now, if they don't drown, we can put thim in Giuseppe's building with the broken espresso machines. Mamma mia, this I like. It—you couldn't even sit on the Spanish Steps without getting that Afrikkkan odor.*

Cowboys and Indians. Here is something, tutti, we can all get behind. *But wait—what is the spray for when the TV cameras come?*

*Oh, dear, you are new. It's only Lysol. Look over your stock incentives under RBGLY—that is, the Reckitt Benckiser Group. So, Lysol and only Lysol, man. It was under twenty before COVID non-tain, and now—main—sky rocket, triple numbers. But you need the real fancy, hazy math suit with double-barrelled back-spray dispensers. See if the girl that skippex collex after Spencex graduation to work for the writer can come up witj a more colorful design. Something greener. Leafy. The idiot vegan liberals adore anything resembling what is left of our once-green, yet now devastated and infested, Mother Nature.*
