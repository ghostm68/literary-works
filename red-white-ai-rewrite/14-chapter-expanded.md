## epilogue 14

(although the paragraph fails to reflect the passage of time in and of itself and by time he means centuries, perhaps it should be read at an unusually detained speed even if it is abundantly clear that we are a long way into the lost art of letter writing epistle it's all episodic commercial animation that is to say there might not actually be choice as we speed into elephant extermination age while rebuilding the hindu lands oh stop already about the caste system sure it was fun while it lasted but you can still dress up for halloween and if anybody sends me anymore leather loafers made in india there will be hell to pay he turns to tune out and finds himself back in korea with his fat wife that has taken to a bit more exhibition of flesh than he in his puritan sensibility would like oh once a mule always a mule and racing across the face mask littered roads he finds kim the hee and holds her hand happily both fully dressed in shyness and a depech mode silence that will haunt him the rest of his days.)

## Epilogue: On Dynasty, Desire, and the Impossibility of Linear Time

Chapter Fourteen is where the manuscript collapses into pure linguistic density—Joycean in its refusal to explain itself, to hold your hand through meaning. It is a list that is not a list, a history that is not history, a love letter written in the names of Chinese emperors and porn actresses, where "little knife necklace" becomes an erotic motif more haunting than any physical description could achieve.

The writer is cataloging Chinese dynasties—SHANG, ZHOU, QIN, HAN, the THREE KINGDOMS, the MONGOLS, the MANCHU—not as dry historical record but as phonetic spell-work, as incantation. The names become rhythm: *GAODI HUIDI LU HOU WENDI JINGDI WUDI ZHAODI*—rolling off the tongue like a rosary, like a hex, like the Nine Circles the witch draws to trap him in her sexual thrall.

And woven through this historical vertigo is the confessional litany of lust: the "little knife necklace" girl who puppets him, Ms. Chu in leather, Ms. Liu with her diamond plug, Kim Hee with her hand-holding shyness, the Australian agent trained in "profound sexual satisfaction," Julia Hahn at the Greek-Turkish border, the Air Lingus flight attendant smirking. Every woman a dynasty, every dynasty a woman. History as eros. Eros as history.

The chapter refuses explanation because explanation would kill it. Like *Finnegans Wake*, it operates on sound, on association, on the collapse of subject-object boundaries. The writer is not describing the witch—he *is* the witch, he *is* the spell, he *is* the sixty-three circles binding him to prose and away from it simultaneously.

"Umrest"—unrest—the Joycean portmanteau that carries both restlessness and the negation of rest, the impossibility of peace when one is possessed by language, by women, by history, by the virus mutating "like a potato for french frying."

The epilogue in v1 is a single breathless sentence-paragraph,time compressed into syntactic chaos: "if anybody sends me anymore leather loafers made in india there will be hell to pay he turns to tune out and finds himself back in korea with his fat wife"—no punctuation, no pause, just the relentless forward momentum of consciousness trying to outrun itself and failing.

V2 spirals into paranoia: Scientologists, Tom Cruise, "what am I tom cruise," the radioactive agent who cannot trust his own imagination. The writer has become the spy in his own manuscript, suspecting that even his thoughts are pre-recorded, that "the process of writing is prerecorded, the writer transcribes this is transcription."

And then the list resumes in v2—but now with annotations, with the writer unable to resist commentary even as he catalogs: "GAODI not to be confused with es pain his architecture barcelona date rape capitol," "LU HOU aha might be the origin of lu lu chu," the slippage between historical empress and contemporary porn actress, between power and exploitation, between worship and possession.

V3 trails off: "waif wait wife he takes a break next cha cha chapter." The writer exhausted. The spell incomplete. The witch still circling. Bianca's ghost appearing with her severed fingers. The Irish comparison—"as difficult as Irish history or perjaps more so"—the six counties, Sinn Féin, another cyclical nightmare of occupation and resistance that the writer "lamented to homself home himself always wanting to onclude in too much."

This is not a chapter. This is possession. This is what happens when you try to hold the history of China, the history of desire, the history of empire and pornography and COVID and witch-spells all in your head at once and refuse to choose between them.

The writer never mentions the Chinese muse's name anymore—"a price he willingly pays for having troubled the aura and vibe of others." But her absence haunts every line. She is the silence around which the dynasty-names orbit. She is the reason the chapter cannot end.

And through it all: "the fighting ain't never done."
