# Chapter Ten (Expanded)

## Ese muchacho es de goma

*Ce gosse est un élastique* (French)  
*Dieser Junge ist ein Gummiband* (German)  
*那个孩子是橡皮筋* (Chinese: Nàgè háizi shì xiàngpíjīn)  
*ذلك الطفل مطاطي* (Arabic: Dhālik al-ṭifl muṭāṭī)  
*הילד הזה עשוי מגומי* (Hebrew: HaYeled HaZeh Asuy MiGumi)

**That kid is a rubber band**

---

Some said he was made of metal, but others insisted he was made of rubber.

Under questioning, he admitted: *It's the blubber. I can't stand the blubber.*

Two hundred pounds folded up under a sari. She could have killed me. And have you tried to get a burger over there? Why, you may as well eat cardboard.

Notice the leather shoes.

Of course, he remembered those pleasant days with **Ms. H** (tall, graceful, silver hair tied back in a long braid, hands calloused from years of handling reins and roses) and her rose farm, horses. Well, **Jack** (lean, muscular, sun-darkened skin, eyes perpetually wary) had a similar problem with the boys wanting to ride him raw.

Ass: the other vagina. South Korean macho men kick the crap out of Holland. One of them exclaimed: *I'd rather go live in North Korea now that this pretty boy has made us look like pansies.*

Some—even many—don't realize the fundamental difference between a woman's derrière and a man's butthole, as it is night and day.

If species extinction and global extermination were not in the way, perhaps the writer would elaborate on the concept, which he puck-picked up from a **Spaniard novelist** (dark eyes, salt-and-pepper beard, cigarette perpetually dangling from his lips) who failed to go into fist—

The mist was clearing, and he was going to a party with a **filmmaker friend** (petite, sharp features, pixie-cut black hair, eyes that burned with ambition and trauma in equal measure) with which he shared dreams. Her movie had made five million dollars in USD currency, and he was thrilled for her success.

Nobody liked her, and much less her trauma, and so there was the danger of sabotage, which came before he could make certain of the spelling.

Telling you this, and yet some of you are like: *Who, me? Not me. I ordered the salad and voted for both Jews,* et cetera.

But wait a few minutes as they turn around within the rarely mentioned ostracism of: *Really? Is that what you are going to wear?!*

*Well, I wouldn't be caught dead in*—fill in the blank—*fur, polyester suit, light-bulb shoes, whatever, not to mention hair.*

N-word will not, won't, wear a 'fro. Dammit, Frodo, the ring—how precious is that? No, the writer has looked, not since the late seventies, not even in Afrikkka.

Groove on it: racism is in the blood, always flowing.

**CEO** (slicked-back hair now shaved into a mohawk, eyes wild with reinvention, suit replaced by leather jacket and torn jeans) with a mantra on repeat walks into the boardroom wearing a mohawk. Board members go pale as newly risen zombies from the tomb, and silent as Nebraska town, four-thirty in the morning. All of them vote for a new CEO—don't even care if it's a woman.

Sometimes growing, the Palestinian (young, desperate, eyes hollow from occupation and humiliation) jumps at the chance to charge at his oppressor, and we all call him a terrorist.

Catwalk error, and suddenly the brand needs rebranding. Who thought the man-purse was finally going to make a profit?

All this, not to mention the economy. Sure, he's cheap and used to ride the subway, but **Rod's** (unkempt hair, stained clothes, body odor like stale subway air and forgotten dreams) even stingier and smells as if he had never got off the train.

*Kept rollin' all night long.*

He was not really made of rubber or metal—except if you count some of his cover songs.
