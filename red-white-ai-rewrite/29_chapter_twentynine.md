# Chapter 29: Chapter Twenty-Nine

## Bob Dylan, Miss Goo Avower, and the COVID Hotline

Not for chronology, yet some such details were worth noting, he mused.

**Pink lock Kim Hee pronounced knee decided forever...Throwing away the key.**

As he dreamt easy with desire bridged by bride, rock star games dropped in on the internet machine in the form of sixteen minutes fifty-six or seven, which some reported as seventeen like the magazine.

**Bob the bird**—some said bard for Alfred Nobel's bounce hawk—the writer knew the songs and there had not been one since 2012.

He wondered, it was about President Kennedy calling him up.

He tried to telex from memory some past chapter that mentioned the conspiracy cover-up, but he couldn't be certain if his boy was playing for Democrats—publicly he had started a Hollywood-style war against this song and dance cum salesman, but it was for show.

If pressed, he could not measure the extent of **Dylan's influence**...the word is admiration, yet it was admittedly tinted by suspicion.

## Ginsberg, Joe, and the Dead Poet

The dead was **Joe**, at the place of roads. Boxcar scribe didn't mention him there or anywhere, even if **Gins** was a mutual friend.

*You locomotive were never no sunflower!*

It might be something or not, how quickly the rot—still, you can't task take away *Masters of War* or the trouble it must have been to escape those lines. *Tarantula*, here lies Bob Dylan, Blind Boy Grunt, Wilbury...

Et cetera. Awake at two, wanting to make love with **Miss Goo Avower**.

Far away and over the hills, the witch menstruated with a heating pad, sending him into ibuprofen maze.

He thought, *I will wait*...the day before, fury had visited, perhaps through that period.

*You call this cardboard food*, he brooded one meal—*why can't it be good?* Going on three days.

The Pernod poster was now butterfly. Always the CVS men in that room across the street, window wide—oh well, let us hope one day they see action other than cum upstairs.

## Curfew, Spandex Girls, and Dick Sauce

Two afternoon, extrasensory alert telepathy flip through news listing—curfew went from eight up to five. In flurry he tried to reach supermarket. *All lost, we close at two thirty today.* He races out with minimal procedure and feeling one with his wife, yet worried over dangers unforeseen.

It was disco for one, **Elsa host** at three, and he would Mossad miss it.

Or would he? Gathering up quick items to line, three girls in tight spandex said *behind us* and therrr he stood grrr while they danced and stole glances at his cashmere scarf serving as inconsistent mask. *My gentle man, go ahead*, they judged, and he gave them kisses in the form of Hershey and hurried back with only a hint of **dick sauce** forming at the tip of his—well, Miss Goo Avower's love gadget.

He would, and yet—

A different disco for one, indeed, with fine woman trio.

It was always too exciting to experience nearness to actual flesh, and times three—well, he must habit been real love for wife to not shock the monkey right after.

All temporary supplies gathered, but money waited to be sent, to arrive.

Here was the genius of tightly knit blockchain cryptocurrencies, yet people were stubborn and certain transactions still had to wait through weather.

Desolate streets silent beneath the sky blasting warmth, he was near to sweating.

He was near to swearing that adoration was all one needed in the poetic terms of aside from the usual.

So long ago, it is not easy to get back the details.

## COVID-19 Hotline: 1-808-COV-ID19

There is still the **corona virus hotline**, an international toll-free service to preregister for professional quarantine: **1-808-COV-ID19**.

Three meals a day and workouts with Richard Simmons. The place had a waiting list for reservations.

*Yes, this is the COVID-19 call center, how may we direct your call—*

The surprise of a live operator instantly kills a great number of callers. Only a gasp is heard before the thump.

*Information—*

Any response including "info" brings through the recording:

*For symptoms press one, for testing press two, for your nearest facility press three, to report a nearby cough press four, to speak to a service agent press five...*

Informants were paid regardless of how much grease the agency managed to get on their frying pans.

Of course, this meant that a lot of folks with mild allergies were targeted repeatedly by snitches out for another payday.

## *Mujercitas*, Suspicion Minds, and Elvis

That day—where was I? Ah yeah, like always, Miss Goo Avower found him an unexpected, exceptional treat: a film from the seventies in cheap imitation Technicolor entitled ***Mujercitas***, and he was thrilled in thought and spirit, much more so since one of the women reminded him of her.

Still, others—those **eyes without a face**—attempted to hound him into doubt. *Who was she really? Could he really trust her?* And the all-time favorite: *"What if?"*

He downloaded the film and waited for the whirlwind of suspicion to settle, or as **E** sang:

*We can't go on together with su-spic-ion mi-nds*

Mines the pause, reflect, outline, plan, posture. Speak to me, spic, in your Spicorama. That song swells as if the mere mention produced internal speaker sound—nothing found, cut reaction, then proceed.

## Editorial Notes:

**Kim Hee / Pink Lock**: The narrator's idealized Korean muse ("Kim Hee pronounced knee") is symbolically locked away "forever," throwing away the key—suggesting both romantic impossibility and self-imposed fidelity to an imagined beloved.

**Bob Dylan / Nobel Controversy**: Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016. The narrator admires him but suspects him of political opportunism or secret allegiance. The reference to "President Kennedy calling him up" evokes Dylan's 1963 "Murder Most Foul," released in 2020 during the pandemic.

**Ginsberg and Joe**: "Joe" likely refers to **Joe Kerouac** (Jack Kerouac), the Beat writer who died in 1969. The narrator accuses Allen Ginsberg ("Gins") of ignoring Kerouac in his famous poem *Sunflower Sutra*. "You locomotive were never no sunflower!" inverts Ginsberg's imagery, suggesting Kerouac was excluded from the Beat hagiography.

**Elsa / Mossad**: "Elsa host at three" plays on "L'chaim" (Hebrew toast), "Elsa" (Swedish name), and "Mossad" (Israeli intelligence), folding Jewish identity, espionage, and Swedish references into pandemic-era paranoia.

**Spandex Girls and Dick Sauce**: The narrator's near-sexual encounter with three women in a supermarket during lockdown heightens his guilt and desire, producing "dick sauce" (pre-ejaculate) that he frames as evidence of fidelity to Miss Goo Avower—he restrains himself out of "real love for wife."

**COVID-19 Hotline Satire**: The fictional 1-808-COV-ID19 hotline becomes a darkly comic surveillance state apparatus where "informants were paid" to snitch on neighbors with allergies. The "live operator" shocks callers to death—a literalization of bureaucratic dehumanization.

**Richard Simmons**: Fitness personality known for flamboyant positivity and workout videos. His inclusion as quarantine camp entertainer suggests the absurdity of forced cheerfulness in dystopian confinement.

**Mujercitas (1978)**: Mexican film adaptation of *Little Women*. The narrator sees Miss Goo Avower reflected in one of the actresses, sustaining his fantasy through cinematic projection.

**Eyes Without a Face**: French horror film (1960) about a surgeon who kidnaps women to graft their faces onto his disfigured daughter. The narrator's paranoia about Miss Goo Avower's identity mirrors this theme of false facades and stolen identities.

**Elvis - "Suspicious Minds" (1969)**: The narrator mis-sings the lyric as "su-spic-ion mi-nds," inserting "spic" (ethnic slur for Hispanics) into Elvis's paranoid love song, connecting his racial anxieties to romantic distrust in a "Spicorama" (panorama of Hispanic influence).

**Blockchain and Cryptocurrency**: The narrator praises decentralized currency as a solution to pandemic-era financial delays, revealing his libertarian/anarchist leanings and distrust of state-controlled money.
