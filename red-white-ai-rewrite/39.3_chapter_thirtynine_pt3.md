# Chapter 39.3: Chapter Thirty-Nine Point Three

## Growing a Tail, Master and Margarita, Father's Day

It felt like ninety degrees everywhere...that night the dreams stumbled in that blurry frenzy. A set of receipts out of location.

He awoke with thoughts of an actor that used to work on a series from the old days—something called *Married with Children*.

He had been haunted by the previous day's talk and perhaps temperature-taking walk. A vague itch arose with him as his backside felt foreign to his touch.

How much...well, he would later proceed to not enjoy the rest of *Atonement*—if anyone asked, leave right after they leave the library and imagine some other plot.

The stillness of morning found him considering if he himself was growing a **tail** instead of a **tale**.

*Master and Margarita*, he told an unfortunate joke. How many hells...the bells ringing...the lesson in class forearm tattoo which you will feel if you are the...

**Frida Kahlo**—the witch etched her arm, and if the spirit sounded right that would make him her...he can't even say it.

*Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me* and *Angel Heart* crash into each other in his imagination. He decides he is not concerned with the proceedings or even the preceding thump.

Sumthing tho—and that choir sing-song sighing, maybe she isn't a witch at all, only your very own...

How many hells, how does one even, he can't even...

**Father's Day** was only days before and then, as if a final irony, the chapter happens to be unplanned: **three nine point three**. That date—her nine, October, ninety-nine.

No, he will make to love her again just like she wants. Suddenly the dog howls and he opts to oppress the lust as a 4.7 magnitude milk shake spills out parts of Mexico.

Sure, the book needed a plot twist, but this is ridiculous. It can't be, and yet he thinks back quick to France—as if directed, *You can't smoke here*, then cut to everybody smoking in another room under a no-smoking sign—Charles de Gaulle, smoke gulp, ashes gallop.

He lights another in present time. It would have been too late, possibly nine months too late. *Where were you on the night of the new year before that?*

Lost in a Hallmark or Lifetime movie about a letter and too much coffee in a flashback drug-fueled daydream which may or may not be ongoing. There are notes somewhere and of course the eventual manuscript.

**Jennifer über alles**, but we are speaking of a woman down in Indonesia. He was too young and still too young and it's **Bali**.

All right, maybe, but a perhaps so unlikely that he wonders how it got so well weird enough to seem or feel even as if fact.

**ELO**...hello, how to take care of business now?

**Bundy**—it says there were two in popular culture: the Al of mention and the Ted of trial. Isn't that it, somewhere between a sick sitcom scene and a highly very serious case?

How jokes would it be if... Let us pretend we do not know as ignorance to bliss—those kisses might yet remain nothing more than adoration.

At this point it might be easier to untangle his locks than go any lower into a drowning theory wherein daughter—

Don't you see, it would only work in fiction and he is not that type of writer, at least not by intention or desire.

It has to be the witch being not only witchy yet also boss bitchy—got his attention all day as she slept in newly tattooed slumber.

## Dog Meat Festival, Say or See in Stockholm Pennsylvania

**Post script**: He looks over the locked chapter, he sees the missing emotion in ellipses and unwritten pauses. Knowing he can paint a better picture from a more inside inner angle, yet he needs to let it stand as it came to him. At least for a while.

The **dog meat festival** market open in China. They look so cute, some of them cooked like piglets. A matter of upbringing or arguably need.

In the low-level high-rise, he watches the complicated title expecting to have a minute with **Say or See**. Halfway thru he decides it is her in a subdued performance she squeezed in between *Little Women* and *Ammonite*.

He was not all there, and she was not at all. Sure, he had seen her name in the promotion credits, a visual mix-up. Once upon a time, *Stockholm, Pennsylvania*, which he missed.

He does not like the lack of balance. Like dreaming of being a guest in house of hated men. Certainty to some degree is key.

Yet there is a thread running or ruining these past couple of days.

## Fish Video, Overfishing 2010, Cannibalistic Hollywood

The witch positions a fish video. He is transported back to circa 2010, the girl asking him about overfishing on two different Broadway streets.

He cannot concern himself with the ocean filled with the notion that the sea is fucked with all manner of man-made waste. A cold stance yet rational, for emotion would not lead to action, only tears.

Hopefully the folks in charge of those waters will step up and dance to the right song. Slowly, as if in a trance, he returns to himself—of course not in time to save the nuclear power-infused waves.

Then browsing online notices it might have been the poster. He adores this one and prays Hollywood has not turned to a cannibalistic factory chewing on its own stars.

He would rather sit through a dog reel—whatever happened to Lassie? Of course not to cook—a thing like that, gotta shave it—he meant the golden retriever movie.

What is a **mivie**? It is what he types after two no-dream days with sister husband on his trail tracking, attacking. Mivie as in movie but more personal.

Then **Dever** is asked to fill in for KK at bookshelf. An interview longer than all the post-*Begin Again* sequences. He had never seen so many liking the sing-song of learnt scales in the shower.

Peeling his banana he proceeded to monkey all night long. Memories of his long-lost beard and the dislike of Adam—thankfully not recognized enough—that feud with haze, but some lines cannot be crossed, not even in mivies.

**Our Lady of Amherst** being the reference. So hey, she too a rock star.

## Monkey Stories, Emma's Pregnancy, Daniella Blocks Him

There were monkey stories in *The New Yorker*—both of them he did not like that drawn-out quasi-magical realism except maybe in Japan they sound poetic, he imagines.

In celebrating earthy **Emma** birthday, he reads other **Emma pregnant**. Was it all too much? **Daniella** blix bloxs him from her insta—god love. He blames the macadamia sauce. How could she?

Aha, domino done downloading. With no dream impetus he dismounts from typing.

## Dawn Dream, Barton Fink, Glasgow Stabbing, Milton Glaser

Later that night in the gallop of no grace, **dawn dream**—someone in his room. Finds himself pleading, *Do not enter*, he does not wish to entertain. Kick-slams the door, removes several layers of wallpaper that were never there—a vague memory of *Barton Fink* follows him as he awakes only minutes after going to sleep.

He knows it is going to be another get-up-at-noon day and momentarily considers staying awake. Already lunchtime in London, evening in Asia. He sleeps but his mind cannot stop calculating.

The **stabbing in Glasgow** with a shot-dead asylum seeker, subsequently followed by the passing of **Milton Glaser**, brings his anagram juices into overload spillover thirst—as when one drinks too quickly and the edge of lip/mouth becomes a streaming mechanism for the fluid that would wander away downward.

There is a malevolent darkness surrounding the weekend like when vultures converge to tax the corpse.

## Paranormal Loafers and BLM Palindrome

Looking at the tired floor he sees proof of it in his shoes—not ever one to wear slippers, he slides around the house in a pair of soft loafers now so mangled and broken that it would be impossible to believe some small animal did not attempt to munch on them.

Usually, in his experience, shoes not worn beyond indoors will last a lifetime, but these are the second such pair to have this sort of **paranormal deterioration**.

Suspicion however makes one no wiser. He considers documenting with a photograph yet that would hold no substantiality in terms of evidence—simply a pair of torn-up broken-down loafers. Perhaps his toes are trying to escape. Some jokes cannot be funny even if they want to be.

**Saturday**. He needs to escape, but he cannot. It's not in his own self, himself...it is roadblocked by others which lead him to self-doubt and worry like breaking news reflected as if to only introduce weather reports.

*How hot is the BLM? Overcast and sometimes drizzle.*

In some quarters a sandwich, yet he had gone some ways into palindromes and noted to no one in particular: **it's MLB backwards**.

Baseball, the national pastime—in which a home run allows the batter to run around the bases while the pitcher paces in wait, perhaps with raised eyebrows. Three strikes or four balls, nine or ten players (you know, designated hitter), nine innings or extra. What would be the opposite of those gloves and uniformed hats?

He cannot say. Quickly considers the lonesome game of golf. Perhaps the contrary is not a game...space travel.

Hmm, still the initials stand there weirdly as the whole movement disperses into seemingly worldwide amnesia. A social media blip, simply in the thousand-year plans of the powerful.

## Russian-Indian Alliance, Hindu Soldier Explosion, Nike and Fried Chicken

Back at headquarters, the Russians have sided with India. *What do you mean he wants to abolish Hindu restaurants?*

The double China-Packy borders are simmering. It might yet be a good summer.

**Hindu soldier** opens Russian armament package. Everybody knows Afghanistan took so long because reading the instructions took years. *Aha, now I understands*—one nearly feels for these caste-inflicted cow-loving dirtbags as the box explodes, killing an entire squadron before they can go out marching.

That's it—baseball has rules, umpires. The movement is anarchy, and not even the good kind. It sure does sound intense as it adds to its own emptiness as if in deluded trance.

*We need Russian translators for these weapons!*

*Say, what, what say, oh say...wait, it gives celebrities a platform to demonstrate how much space they can use up to distract from their private lives. Come on, it's perfect.*

Anarchy. It upset some and they held a meeting.

Then in one fell swoop all the nigger and *speak to me spic in your Spicorama* ganged up and gave their money away to the opposite of baseball. Nike shoes and fried chicken flooded the so-called ghetto and a space program was implemented to get the darkies into Mars or wherever.

One rapper even donated his cars and clothes.

## Editorial Notes:

**Growing a Tail/Tale**: The narrator fears the witch has literally caused him to grow a tail (demonic transformation), paranoia heightened by backside itch and Frida Kahlo tattoo references.

**Father's Day / 39.3 / October 9, 1999**: Numerological coincidence suggesting the witch's birthday (10/9/99) aligns with chapter number (39.3), reinforcing her demonic control over the manuscript.

**Al Bundy / Ted Bundy**: Sitcom father vs. serial killer—narrator suggests his life exists between absurd comedy and true crime horror.

**Dog Meat Festival**: Annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China—narrator notes they "look so cute...cooked like piglets," cultural relativism masking disgust.

**Say or See / Stockholm, Pennsylvania**: Saoirse Ronan film (2015) about kidnapping victim—narrator believes she is his muse "Say or See" in disguise.

**Milton Glaser (1929-2020)**: Iconic graphic designer (I ❤ NY logo), died June 26, 2020. Narrator links his death to Glasgow stabbing via anagram obsession.

**Glasgow Stabbing June 2020**: Sudanese asylum seeker Badreddin Abedlla Adam attacked hotel residents, shot dead by police. Narrator conflates refugee violence with his own paranoia.

**Paranormal Loafers**: Shoes deteriorating supernaturally—evidence of demonic presence or the witch's curse.

**BLM = MLB Backwards**: Black Lives Matter palindrome reveals "Major League Baseball," suggesting the movement is sports/entertainment distraction, "not even the good kind" of anarchy.

**Russian-Indian Alliance / Hindu Soldier Explosion**: Geopolitical fantasy where Russia arms India against China, but Hindu soldiers die because they can't read Cyrillic instructions (echoing Afghan War incompetence).

**Space Program for Darkies**: Sarcast proposal that BLM donations fund sending Black people to Mars—framed as celebrity distraction and racial deportation fantasy.

*Chapter 39.3 spirals through tail-growing paranoia, Father's Day numerology, dog meat festivals, Say or See sightings, Milton Glaser's death, paranormal shoe decay, BLM as MLB palindrome, and a Russian-Indian alliance exterminating Hindu soldiers, ending with celebrities funding a Mars deportation program for "darkies."*
