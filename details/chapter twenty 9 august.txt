He holds the eight and nine of august as key dates to something not entirely understood in his mind -

Where were we - before the previous chapter could exhale the battled for breathing, "the leader of the band" died - a peaceful man...

He had heard of the film but knew not who sugarman might have been -  

His intent was to make nine more videos before the date turned while hawaii burned and a politico got bumrushed by bullets in quito - God is a bullet, He loves Maika, a true story - steak and rice hypnotized - mother strangely ill then not ill then ill then not ill and the supermarket out of chicken sent in an aggressive looking turkey leg -

it looked more like a weapon - ecuador also made a video - bodyguards disappeared as the car door shut and shots rang out like scripted dialing from a call center - sixty three, the secret service was ordered to stand down - thirty six dead in maui -  fbi murdered suspected dissident - robertson two!!

there was a feeling in the air of irony, but in the last hour of the day he sat and smoked his way through the shoot - disregarding the pull from canto, from news, from mother -  from sunlight - vertigo alzheimer's neighbor motorized man to turn over her corpulent body it always was hinted at aunt as if an inheritance, we say it then it happens to you, hello, sandra gone but the son begs and yells, eggs of gossip, raping schoolkids, striking his grandmother, and other bullshit stories repeated as if fact against logic or math where nothing matters still shouting "grandmother" - again he grins pleased to not be any of them -

alivia wore keira's beetlejuice t-shirt and emilee felt distant all day until he realized she was so near as if part of himself - in a dream naked girls kissed a shaved vagina - he seemed to be simply standing there, dreaming - after the long day he dreamt of her but it seemed she wanted to keep it secret and as the scenes revolved he found himself immersed in an ex speaking of what if our love is meant to be eternal -

no no i'm with stupid - the slow prose poured out as if several censors had set up filters against his speed, his seed pinballing so as to even make the cat jump -

goat games, bloodline heroes of lithas - someone had gone to a lot of clone trouble to grant reversible companions and keep volusia poor - 

fourteen miles an hour - he is overthinking, in his defense if someone is going to die why not make it easier to understand - all across the telegraph, his name it did resound...

neverova makes him smile wishing he could resume the maria artworks - 

coffee and cigarettes, national lazy day missouri, isthmus years ago when ivangorod fell to panzer corps names not usually associated with world war deuce, estonia, finland...north korea announces an engagement to conflict, joe sucks his cornflakes, everybody had to pay and pay...

reed it when you purge dissent you purge what is pure...

He sighs, he knows the chapter is a disaster, he knows emilee might already be at work, he knows he won't be able to call her and say we have made it and you no longer need to nine to five but it won't be today.
