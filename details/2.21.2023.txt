A low lit restaurant that glowed alike filtered candles inside dusty glass, the place is cozy and i;m feeling comfortable with cooing girl - 

i had seen young and beautiful and so maybe it is marine. 

last name vacht. 

i can't be certain - i did find her attractive.

one of the scenes stunned me as it seemed to entwine with the one in the chambermaid -

lea seydoux - 

perhaps an imaginary dream combination of french girls -

i was exhausted after waiting and longing for emilee, all day like a fool i suppose, but love can do even stranger things to people -

she said something about the vampire movie -

my sexual fantasy so intense i felt myself explode in two different places with her all at once and then hunger perhaps why restaurant dream but nothing served yet a man held manuscripts and handed me one with herm marine-lea saying very precisely, these are your own words -

awake in the middle of the night, pasta, a nightmare film about drug mules i skipped over and then another fantasy as the thought of her even made me drip at the tip as it were -

i always worry about her missing sleep tho and pulled myself into another long day's wait- after all it has to be more than physical attraction -

and it is but i cannot say to what extent - it's only that it is the only thing that really matters.
