all day two women on my mind, finding the wait no song - long - yet strong - 

wednesday at dawn looking through the empty yesterday - 

i wanted her so i felt myself go through her into some mystic space -

perhaps the waiting is wrong - 

makes it too intense even if only a day - 

the doctors is a highly underrated film, excellent in many ways - 

happy i saw it scene by scene seen it -

aside from zelda and emilee i felt keira but in some distant way like there was a message and indeed there was but i was dumb and deaf to it except for some vague instances until much later -

included here and beetlejuice in the film list -

cooking now waiting on women talk -

mother talking frightens me - is the cat dead, what does one say - it is an inherited cruelty from other folks fixed on meanness...

i can't explain this, like roselen suggesting i sell the apartment to her husband's soon to be released from jail and deported exconvict brother -

as if, words were deeds in some backward identity theft dimension -

then mother says maria called to report that nancy died - neighbor santana - 

i weighed it over those few memories - still wanting to speak of antiviral and never got to the volk as russian wolf but german folk and international car prefix wagon -

there's danger in my senses and i felt abducted in my dream - imagine it a supermarket a bag and the strange long ago argument of using a bag to shop instead of a cart - before the horse some people simply do not stop - i wonder why me over and over awaking hours too early -

like nature angry at the disregard of lives lost in turkey at the sight of ukraine hoopla and strange sean penn homoerotica release -

i shut my eyes and pretend to dream of emiliee until i am dreaming awake and nearly ejaculating -

hopelessly in love i try to move into the day although it is only three in the morning - 

distracted nicely by a strange game that offers companions and heirs -

suddenly i am ranked eighty eight -

i grin at how judgemental i am at the sight of the offspring -

oh this one yes this one looks like a winner let me put more into educating that child -

the steak is cooking and the rice is heating -

south park was a highlight as ifelt the queen deserved that sort of play and poke at the people that even upon her death sought magazine covers -

but i nearly wept at the self knowledge of my loneliness as the kids gathered to visit the one that had been keeping to himself as i knew nobody i wanted to see would be hanging around my door -

compouned by the loss in mind of mother and aunt and to some extent now nancy who certainly was something of a friend even if it had been years before...

before all this thinking my new list, i recognized as not only interesting but the only one of its kind in relating series concering writers - 

there is some sense of accomplishment, but my ambition has suffered given the other circumstances.
