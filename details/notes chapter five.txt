notes -

a french film postulates that the nose is the gateway to the soul -

i dream filling up the bathtub and racing back just in time as it was nearly overflowing -

put coins in a nuns hand, arieli from saint lucia mexico, the mother superior had not granted permission for lunch or coffee -

town not near the beach -

are you the sister or the mother, woman in sandals next to me leaning on the exchange wall, wave and away -

shoulder pain moved to bicep, forgotten as hip pain swayed and disappeared in speaking to her -

shopping a bit more than expected - parmalat milk mystery perhaps they are pushing the lesser brands -

forgot the bread - 

it was ten in the morning after making love to emilee at two, we were entwined again at dawn, she said you realize now that you have not had this much sex with any other woman and in historic calculations it counted up correct - on some legal ground she must have a claim now as common law wife even if uncommon - 

i slept then only partly concerned that key guidance kept playing in my mind's eye - 

in before sleep, i couldn't get near to emilee although I kept seeing and in seeing her with another man i took his head and smashed it against the hotel hallway - there was a trace of blood on my right hand's ring finger and i awoke feeling very much as if it had been true -

i did in fact kill the vocal on bang bang bang bang cover which features her intro and outro - it was a horror of a first take  but i suspected there must be some art to it since it felt good while in the moment -
hours later, all the time asking should i simply record another take, i came near to some harmonic balance but i was wrong - for a second i felt a presence, artists will understand, that contrary spirit and i even actually rendered a take without vocal effect! i of course redid it and even released it (it was as amatter of fact only for my own fun and entertainement) but waking up i heard it as if my ears and mind had been switched off - two remixes later i am content with the version and yes even the vocal - i never saw jamie so clearly, it was a song she liked and i learned it through her - 

-in my defense- i do not have a microphone since sony spoiled - and i am not familiar with my new recording setup to track while listening so i actually used a video from another version as a guide - in the past i had several headgear sets all which were it seems intruded upon by relatives of the contrary spirit presence - which is why i pack up everything of that sort everytime i step out - 

colombia on high volcano alert but i know vulcan prefers a more clear cut rock and roll - 

there's the pull and of course the ghosts of 1985 -

libeled lady was hoot - 1936 - i was so hungry i started to devour a lime as i waited for my meal -

it was delicious or i am rock star going a bit insane, don't forget who you are la la lalala...

the sight of mila and her family in venice sent me into when i paint my masterpiece in three grateful dead versions and later investigating the chords i came up with a lovely two chord g/c - e sus thing that i have not seen before - luckiest girl might be an understatement -

kunis was russian now ukrainian but i feel i have solved the matter in the example as follows, claiming ukraine is not russia is like claiming austria is not german. 

in any case, i could not write, two army helicopters collided in kentucky - those faces, our faces...morgan anne french - seventeen years old in another town - her burial today - born 2005 - but not because of that but because the track became a job a vocation an addiction and i saw myself able to work at it in all sorts of different ways but as i was about to go for an alternate mix i said to myself let it go and so i did but for a while the feeling remained nearly as if i had been self sentenced to continue - 

now how in the world is this going to be incorporated into a chapter five - i'm too tired to see a way other than to have non-chapters between certain chapters yet what would they be named -
