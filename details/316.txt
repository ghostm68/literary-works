two days in a row, i hear her as i awake asking me to stay up - me as a husband still trying to get out of going to school...i stay in bed...for a while -  the couple making love right beside me when the woman foots my crotch i ejaculate rising in blue drawstring pajamas soaked except i;m still sleeping naked as i get up wondering if i should even bother to wait any more -
some small argument like the little cannibal roach gnawing away at the slain cockroach i walk out strangely dreaming a key at the door then sauntering smoothly from one known town to the next - no text three days - i didn;t mean nagasaki and hiroshima but dresden - kentucky fucked chickens the cold oil is going to drench the fries where is my wrench -  a locked pepsi - i pass by a pizza shop taking note of the chairs - but suddenly it is washington square and i inquire at some man who responds in a touchy feeling manner alike the blind man i once upon a time good samaritan - your heritage is worth what construction site nigger on a bike like i pick up rocks did you ever burn a nigger i see the way out but drowsy into no movement sandinista cracked my snap into pop van a sticker on the available window label spic but spelled like sick - slick aint no joke -
i had felt left knee pain and right side palm hurt possibly realizing i was banging inside premonition to get away alabama getaway in the dream i shout medic so loud i could hear the metallic ring in the moving van - it is the last day of school silicone chip inside overload valley signature hug group gym i gulp at my own worries - not to mention two sisters in law if wed - hindu torture from empty steak container - contrary to desire i decide the school side will have to not be or be in retrospect - as soon as it is over to sneak out of the bathroom - she came in who is going to take you home - well in fact  i don't force myself in any way except to wait for emilee - 
today in arrow - what do you mean they don't have a chakra class in medical school - medic - i dream through the biography of ulysses s grant  - yesterday - a man's chest cut open thin red line white hanes racism is only an american thing - the civil war rebel i heard was only fighting for his home for his friends - wanted to enlist at fifteen but had to wait till sixteen - first time i heard president davis vocalized - but im too distracted to write as if someone wants a show and others a joint bank account not meaning weed -
seed exploded in rolled sensemillions when the the ashes snowed into the breeze - maybe there is no chakra at all - i don;t mean to attack any belief system but if i check into a quality hotel they better have a way to serve hamburgers - here they are trying to serve me anny or maybe only the next door disguised as her - in dixie they called it an invasion - dollars ukraine not banks, i want to react yet it is obviously too weird to resolve - news nobody says nothing so i think finally or financially i will give up on the news but damn to hit your mother with a hammer so she wont feel the knife - i'm sorry your mother died emilee laughs, sarah went on to win the oscar - or ig in al - originally i thought the music proves the southern side as god's own choice - even years later you can hear it in sweet home - but this what happens when you know you shouldnt write yet get pressed into it - depressed into it - all against monogamy even the game with several companions onions curtain - i can't curtail the cruelty in the world -
and i do not want to - it is there in nature and so the bully blazes through for giggles as if writing were a put on every nothing passing thought - masked eyes without a face - face it with eyes masked - love me two times vulcan i made the art as i turned away from two story lines - i have no need to tear away the fabric flesh of reality with the claws of  inventions which might then yield manifestations elsewhere - anyway neither outline was about witchcraft - 
if i do not believe in myself then nothing else can hold faith - faithless perhaps in others yet in me -
someone at my bio novel seemingly insisting - but there is still no magic but this magic i get up to make pasta and chop the bully into chop pieces to throw out with the rest of the trash.
