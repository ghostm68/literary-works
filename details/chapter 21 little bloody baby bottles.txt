They werent supposed to make no infant into a vampire, but there it was...A night creature in a stone crib surrounded by little bloody baby bottles -

the days were passing, but he felt no rush to hurry into notes. however, there were some details that he did not want to miss - or perhaps the book didnt want to miss them -

it was the 26th of august, his zcash wallet balance wasn't what it was supposed to be and his phone had a busy signal instead of a dial tone -

a storm ( some rain) had come and gone, he thanked vulcan for the greeting; a cool announcement that hid the sun itself as if displaying the power beneath the earth - 

there was yet a week left of "visiting" and he considered waiting it out without writing -

the government had ordered everything shut down for two days as if mere rain should be illegal - 

he was utterly baffled - 2023 and drain systems could not be counted on in the caribbean...

when the sun "returned"  it felt like insanity - 

his dreams were insanely swift, in the fast forward he noted a hug and kiss with zofia, or perhaps lara next to the recently painted kitchen -  both taller than him and so the estimation  - steaming blonde naked on a bed he neared in another scene, clearly aleksandra - her grin awakened him - it seemed to forecast the pretty strange juxtaposition which transpired upon taking a look at ahsoka silent h - jedi drama - made him count the three vaginas he had encountered in film, rosario taking gold, eva silver, and liv bronze -

bertolucci's lens at the green and tyler - 

in the meanwhile he lost touch with emilee and had no response within himself as to the reason - 

regaining so-called touch, it was without a question the same yet the shadow of doubt remained - 

even his apple iphone which refused the for you feature after he he filled the album with her photos, came to life with galvan after he dreamt of her while recording several bowie covers...

he could feel his characters coming to life and wondered if that is why bowie switched personas during his career -

car in the sky 616 flies right into wagner - cows on the south pole moon position fourth nation to reach the pink floyd album...

someone made an interesting point about the warnings from the state department asking people to leave places as if they knew what was coming before communicating - case in point they were implying belarus as they had ukraine- i embrace sonya having lived with her and imagining myself in pinsk - risky speculations - la woman plays mister mojo risin' 

mug shot hypnosis, the mugwamps gather international mass cross nation attempt at everything all at once - 

it's cold here ma, i don't want to eat the scraped bits of teflon no more...

it's awful here ma, i can't hear miley's new song until bluescluez plays it -

it's weid here ma, i drink all the mango juice just to get rid of the "agitate before serving" sign on the carton ...

it's strange here ma, daria in a look feels like emilee, doesn't she know she doesn't need make up and party clothes to graduate, i think it's worse than zelda going to the theater freshman year broadway syracuse man passed out at the bod egad my ego dj equipment instead of books - room with a kylie - i promised her the four years but if this is any indication we are bound for trouble - the streets even before winter seem as desolate as my own surroundings, a few passing cars, nobody around as if they are busying hunting something, someone...of course i'm old fashioned yale do not go out after eight int he evening period.
