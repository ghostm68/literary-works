note from march six, nearly perfect in more ways than one given the right feel of synchronicity has vanished -

this despite having saved it here and also in the backup which automatically saves to external cloud -

ah wait nevermind - it simply got slid down as to seem as if the fifth was the last note,

chronology, i sqeezed my blank mind trying in vain to recapture the nuance one can never regain in retyping -

the pepsi froze making a frozen pepsi i had one cigarette left upon waking after going late night worry and wonder and wanting with emilee -

did we make further vows, did i? at some point i do know i would have promised her anything -

ninethirty here ten thirty, in trying to get up i recall alina timo short for some russian name hen cove.

it is what she said - buckle up and sit down - or perhaps it was looking at downfall thankfully the tv actor did not stand out so much as the other time - i was viewing for bruno - i thought you'd be taller -
  
impossible performance that swiss playing austrian which like ukraine was to russia usually german -

i made sense of locking up the kitchen and packing up my gear into a locked suitcase inside a locked closet struggling to shit shave and take a bath with a pint of water and ivory soap -

i wear the same clothes i left out and feel my shoes have gone to hell but what the hey -

im only there for cigarettes not a fashion show -

it hurts as i walk, my sole bandages improvised with masking tape and men standing there as if waiting i cross to the other side exhausted as i near the entrance already - i try not to think about it but nothing helps - i go on let me see ah yes milk coffee sugar lemons pepper and a tomato -

it is a good thing i have two hundred million oh no that is the game...

i tip the cashier reluctantly as she was so intent on havving me hear the name jose security guard cum bagger i do not know but somehow have heard bla bla bla whatever make my to the other cashier i usually tip so she does not feel as if i missed her on purpose - then leave for a second feeling like myself- i see angelina carrying a boat load of shoe boxes and i arrive to say hey but in her excitement to greet drops them and i with some lithe spirit that i suppose hides as the imposed pain pounds pick up some and hand it to her as she tells me no it is all right so i refrain but proclaim my apology for intruding and promise not to return - the pain starts before i make the mall exit and i stand there hoping it will go as quick as it came but it wont, i make my way back and stop for a second to study my reflection - it is me but i am too used to myself to really have a good idea -

thoughts and memories swirl as if someone is trying to browse through my recent inner files - 

i am confused, i want to hold on to emilee and have her hold me but she is at work i imagine - 

i put the bag on the kitchen counter and sit for a smoke as the throbbing in my hips and inner left thigh crazes me - 

how can we have a pure aryan race if have got yourself mixed up with a common chinese vixen -

the fixings, who knows i do not - mister i do not see the leg -

i did have a hint of angelina at the lobby and realized i had had some other spectral feeling before exiting -

i cannot find a film to download and death note subtitles are far off the mark - you don't need them for this one but i was being stubborn - tune into the notorious landlady instead jack so smooth i didn;t know i missed him so many tears in that other movie - the lamplight date make me think of emilee, but that is a lie as i am always thinking of her -  i pause the reel and hear some woman moaning and purring in that oh me oh my i am having an orgasm and i start to wonder how am i going to control this in order to wait the rest of the day for her - i breathe and shake my head and look about myself then think maybe i can find the answer in one of her pictures, a silly thought but in the contemplation i pour myself a jigsaw puzzle and let the phone ring as the sexual feeling had not entirely subsided not that i can recall answering the phone with an erection although there was that new apartment doctor call but she was talking as i worked the wonder - sperm squirt - 
maybe even in her turning away from me she feels i might cheat and tries to make me jealous instead -

hear me roar,  meat and rice - not collar but clavicle - note for before page -

i held no intent to cheat but i could never catch the bus to pomona  i mean i could never decipher how to spiritually as it were have a friend in imagination when the option for a lover is a greater thing -

i want you to play with my dingaling -  same with the races - so you want to say i am not accepting of certain types yet what about all the other types that seemingly don;t matter, i would say there are only two genders except for the baca or chupacabra but there are not only two races -

forcing let us say a china woman on me then voids japanese or philipinese or any knees as the oar contiunes insisting on the peking now beijing by jings how i wish i didnt have to worry about my own preferences - 

already too many details, i found myself forgot the end of himmler, why turnow was in my song - 

but more than that my wood headedness prevented me from learning even more much earlier when mailer tried to tell me the truth or part of the truth about the third reich -

i thought i was in the right and in some ways i was but like charles manson said plainly too many died for the nazi salute and if ganz did embody hitler as i feel he did subtly that subtle gesture of sliding his hand down the arm af his secretary  as  a parting gift tells us more than anything can explain - in essence like the movie title a triumph of the will -

my end of the world 1945 theory pulls at me but i have other tidbits now  but that is for something else -

telegraphed coined shoemageddon, dang it i am going to walk into this manuscript and muse over the school before my connections leave for syracuse -
