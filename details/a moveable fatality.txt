you make me wonder, six march ten thirty in the unedited book morning -

for a minute, i was all right even if a bit sore at the soles -

dream love playing with a doll shaped like taylor swift - i think i am with emilee but it is dark and i'm thinking of the irony that she likes jake, new moon jake as you might know gyllenhall was all the hate last year in breaking up - no way to break it all down -

back in the dream i had left some money sitting on a table and some man tries to take it with a double twist since in the scene i think it is my father then to fight and take back into my pockets but the gloom provided was enough to hurt me i stood there noticing a picture now alongside the money that is the wrong amount as i awake the gloom it seems from the confrontation lifted the sole pain onto my lower back - 

in between the desperate feeling of doom i thought of my easter song - lennon was shot in the back -

five as fuck she said once, i struggle to sit and to stand, i smoke and feel far from ecerything including myself - myself  i had viewed the evil eye shocked as the witches within the reeling script revealed another type of baca - buried instead in the ground until it hatches -

holy shit, it might be the only reference in film outside of the far horizon - novel first called selah - 

the ending song "so red" -  then realizing the anagram a cab -

 and if a cab what does that make the driver?

but i am not concerned with any of that really because of pain which mysteriously ended after reading that gary rossington had passed away -

a hurt like a haunted insanity that comes and goes makes for well i do not know, how could i?

what is really on my mind is the hope that she is all right and safe -

i play a bit of if you people cause me trouble i will put you all in the ground, after some scales -

but i feel a crowd and the lights go out as if to match the water -

i let it go as the avocado man starts to scream that once again he has avocado and turn on dw where a hindu red spot woman is talking about the caste system which is not racism or whatever -

she worked all over silicone valley looks like a demon in glasses i guess it didn't work since the sound of the street vendor is still in the air so i play skeleton in the closet as i write now it's mexicali blues -

sarah won best screenplay and i felt the nod at shut your pie hole and sighed at how cool that is even if i most like will not get into the guild -

award season a war season landslide indonesia january six rumours stolen election what makes me laugh well when a man tells us he is planning to run again and when another says i only like women my age or older even his wife is a few years younger herself -  a word seasoning how am i to clean the pots with that little african drip at the tap -

maybe we can all get a baca or a cab - but to conclude ezra correct the age demanded an in image of its accelerated pace as then emojis validate my minimalist writing in certain works. 

i knew it, but i feel a bit more certain after thinking of it in those terms.
