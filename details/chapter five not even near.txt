holy thursday removed chairs from balcony - ordered water, drinking type - wandered around myself nearly like a stranger - went to sleep in the late afternoon - awoke as if my thoughts had gone into hiding - 
12 35 good friday everybody must get stoned after the seder - 

point is no chapter five yet - so what have i done - remix solitary man for kicks, remix all the things she said yet it made me take notice of the fact there is more to that first round than i thought -

i viewed inside but overwhelmed by the memory of bobby peru deep sound at pee and the actual pee pee - 

who knows maybe willem is drugs!

of course after his portrayal of van gogh, and to think of it it was some anniversary, i had to give it every benefit of the doubt -

i also seen me pistol - but it proves that tits well the right tits, those tits in episode two could not be surpassed - the series floated in a sort of self implosion after the tits - except maybe when chrissie is revealed as hynde - if one didnt pick up on it before - doing an early version of kid - man that first pretenders album is a revolution in itself - anyway nearly a good show - i did feel that maise was exploited and also that in my dream it might have been a dwarf - but so thin?

i started my cloud domain with maisie since i adore that picture of her in jet plane sweater - recently at wordstar when i thought the drama with emilee had got out of hand, and i suppose that led to now pre-birthday at info domain suddenly two additions also at tvc15 list  -  i like her name margaret constance williams - checked out her tattoos - but it's weird she is invisible to me in imagination -  or someone prevents me from that sort of thinking - fences make good nations - 

going to view the owner later - 

earlier in dreams - i sensed a cousin nearly as if a peeping tom as i entertained a nude in my bed, somehow not emilee - perhaps the angelina from ego  - yet the ejaculation entwined with thoughts of family - family i keep using the word as if there was no irony to it - another story, maybe - the boundaries that bounce -
 
vulgarity crept throught the day and it horrified me in the sense of projected visions somehow in the eyes of others, hell in the eyes of children - but nobody cares obviously since screaming yelling is allowed in the streets for any age at any price - 

got rid of my old steve madden loafers on the offchance that there is more to it than meets the eye -

looked at the newspaper - twenty four pages only one of them classified - nothing interesting or notable -  but being paranoid over intrusion the red sofa ad from radiocentro with an acoustic guitar did make feel spied upon - 

mob, my own business - not inclined to speculate - i will say that hearing castro, ie also another furniture store, made me feel as with manson and to some extent hitler - no lies there - 

in my dream, which only returned to recall after asking myself if i actually slept, i was given a red and black t-shirt and a sort of matching red and black cloak with a hood - it seems i was to oversee or guard some sort eyes wide shut orgiastic gathering - 
i only held glimpses of the folks as i walked around the rooms - until being stopped as if someone knew i didn't have the stamp on my forearm, some sort of requirement to be there - to be where...

did i ask to be there? i don't think so - i suppose subsequently i found myself outside shirtless or topless although the word topless does not align with masculinity - but i carried a golf club - not a punter but the heavy type and as i passed a house a ball rolled out from a couple of old men punting in their front yard - putin defector told of identical offices - it was an old man and for some reason i started telling him that maybe the cops would leave me alone if i didn't wear a shirt - two other men at the other end of the corner appeared to stroll by shirtless - even in a dream it is impossible to convey in any concise way the trauma of police prosecution - the actor that played christ passed away - jesus is often, if not dead, topless at his home - not my style - don't want to write about this person as then i would have to make mention of jesus as in yocandy's husband - hubba hubba bubble gum blues not to mention the nazarene - names is names - for example mario the lawyer but then mother could not recall mario the dentist - eva at it over a decade - i'm plants - so dry to vaseline - ran the water but actually forgot to turn it off somehow the african drip went slow enough so as not to spill over - but i'm out of the dream of course without a proper segue - so what - it is only notes - 

street food bar No. 1 saint petersburg - universitetskaya embankment by the river Neva -

some stories nobody can invent - the culprit refused to near the target when asked to come closer - tougher than the teenage night witches in rickety planes - who would sit by knowing that any second boom! boompa died, rocky raccoon - can't think of the lyrics now - perhaps she is telling the honesty in not knowing but then she would have neared, no? 

why do i hover over the scene? not sure, but being so delayed, so derailed, why not the kitchen sink as it were - maybe i should skip chapter five.
