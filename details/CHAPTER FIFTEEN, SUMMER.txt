The weather reports with a "feels like" equivalent. I am not certain exactly why I was not writing and or editing this work in progress...

There was a writer's strike, but I was only briefly allowed to participate in the Writer's Guild East.

I had no stake in that sequence...Except for the obvious future possibility.

Perhaps, it was because I had lost my dream connection to Emilee...Somehow, rapid eye movement became fragmented light speed with a few instances of that bonded feeling.

I will here quickly explore some scenes, two uncles handing me money one used the word deprived / stepping off a bus that had stalled i pulled my salad bags - could not tell if the road was sarasota or riverside drive - a naked girl face down on the side of the sofa in my room - i have a vague memory of touching her - passed out perhaps from dream orgy as i visited some sort of jewish hermit trying to get back to my room encountering explicit scenes / speaking of the sexual; a girl holding my erection between her feet / light floating without memory or recall / people in the house as I try to explain to mother why I should move as she does not listen /
asleep next to a girl - dreams that felt reality's crawl -
nervous door dream awake to a missing "ello" website, still gone two days later - 

In any case, all the while I kept my vow to her, it seems impossible or contrary to logic - yet yes even going as far as considering unconditional love -

every once in a while, I wanted to write some of that feeling here within these notes yet at no time did the inclination make me surrender to waiting -

there are new facts and figures that should be included but this is like a new introduction so that will be later -

meanwhile i was making music, covers, perhaps too many - including her in some...

unknowingly i was perhaps practicing for my new releases - there were about nine or eight - although i had only a clear idea about a certain tango style -
which i felt came through nice enough but within the hurry and hush involved with worrying that sounds could be heard in the nearness i even raced through the tracks so as not to be accused of a collaboration or worse with so-called neighbors - 

meaning, for the most part it is a mystery to myself in terms of lyrics, chords, notes - 

i say that with some pride, like a master spy that could not possible divulge his own secrets as he kept them to himself -

a couple of the recordings suffered for the rush, but here and there i felt ten feet tall for having heard what i heard at playback -

lighter too close to palm and it tingles in the uncertainty of burn or freeze -

the most recent recording was an impromtu cover, a song called summer but in russian...leto -

i first heard it in a film, then i listened to the recording and thought i have to cover it except how could i get the language - as with several languages i only know a few words there - but for some reason i went for it, hearing it over and over and using the phonetic translation - it was all over in minutes and not as awful as it might have been - i did try a quick translation but knew it had to be - well, some art simply has to be a certain way - it can be done but in so doing it becomes something else -

i didn't want it to be anything else - like my love for emilee, it can't be filtered into any explanation which would make sense outside of its own magic.

in other words, i am celebrating the solstice by slidling back into this unforeseen expedition.
