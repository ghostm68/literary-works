inside a house he has not known, there are wolves, child wolves, pup-wolves, cub wolves...he is not certain how to name them ...

furry things alike those blue eyed dogs that always seemed to him so fierce -

inside a house he has not known he is dreaming, he is chasing one of them without being aware of the reason, but he is intent within the task -

he thinks of los lobos and hitler and perhaps his mother -

he catches sight of his uncle having missed emilee's post at midnight - she quotes her girl crush, kill the messenger...he had been thinking of his own note when ice meant not cigarettes - for luck, he had written and felt the passage as if he had looked at the manuscript but he had not peeked at it in several years - who knows perahps someone was trying to stereotype him...or worse a hack pretending to be him -

independent contract exchange, he ponders for a split second - exhausted by the day attending to chobolobo - two fans cleaned, breakfast served, floor mopped, sheets changed twice, hand washed curtain changed and living room curtain changed, her bedroom cleaned and his own, not to mention the bookcase moved into the hallway and adorned...

he had not worked so hard since being a messenger -
catching the wolf he opens the door of a room, a man is there, perhaps his father, he disregards the problematic our father who art in whiskey and put-places the animal therein.

awaking it was two in the morning - he puzzled at an obituary after chasing a roach until catching it and killed another by slamming one of the kitchen drawers on it....unwrapping the listin and using the plastic to push it outside and away -

hopefully there are no spirits in cockroaches - 

hunch, he found her post but he did not feel the excitement that usually extends itself within his joy - no he felt curious - maybe the love making before drifting into dreams had been too intense - 

but it would actually get even more real in the hour before dawn - it was the same story he kept telling himself...how could i ever be unfaithful if she is always on my mind - he reveals the tidbit as in the course of so called thinking a doctor in the city had raped dozens of women with drug and even video he means he had thought of other women as she felt so distant - 

in any case he had no words for the excited feeling rushing through his pre-dawn encounter - it might as well have been a bomb going off and the remaining pieces of his mind were dreaming of some other place an apartment with a stereo and music playing a man asking him about the bob dylan at john wesley harding reminding him of cronenberg - 

he thought about the track list and could even hear some of the songs in a simultaneous thought through speech sensation much later a bus crash sent him howling with cackling laughter as they mentioned putting up barriers to prevent further incidents but it felt so obvious that now vehicles would crash into the very same preventive measures, the day had been too much, the carrots in the chinese take out had hardly been cooked - galvan looked fine in blue navy attire - the set kept fading into green as if to make subscribers watch the repeat on telemicro at six - 

sand in his eyes, he added to his film list without pictures - imagining emilee on the way home or was it at eight...the post deleted -  he wished he could delete the illogical conversation with his sister or at least turn it to his advantage -the rolling stones posted a clip of neighbors and he had wanted to mention her favorite actor's loss and the tragedy of not knowing a name in time - backtrack story locked in closet prowler in the house then he had no idea one of the annoying upstairs held that name - i feel the cahiers lust as she slowly slides the transaction receipt into my right palm - the cry was always "abuser" or "i have no money" over and over - as if bookending the avocado and bizarre little pickup trucks with loudspeakers insisting they will buy anything that is olden - except for the time when the coconut went through the window - none of your nightmares could inform you of the horror of having these memories as if against his own reverie - 

in later months and especially years he could only wishe them disappear or die - imagine it, to have a hounding continue until it makes you irrational !

by that he means, death would not eradicate the remembrance -  he took a beat breathing before the show concluded and told himself he would have yet time for everything on his unwritten agenda before going to sleep, before giving himself to emilee - 

a turn at the scales and he would be done except for the wieghts - tom was dead, the waiting is the hardest part - tom was not dead, i will be satisfied i will have satisfaction before i'm gone...tom tom club no genius here his ass hurts from chair press pose love band put the weight on me take jack the dog - 

international cat day he wishes he could shave his feet, his soles - the callouses yet aching - what is worse playing out spanish songs for mother creates an unexpected echo intermittent here and there, the strangest thing -  enough of the draft -

never did a fan hold so much dust dear me and you it was so bad back on the reservation they agreed that is why waterboarding works, you could seduce and tickle for hours and even strike and slam and still no spill put pouring in some direct suffocating liquid well, ladies and gentlemen - 

the infant serial killer, the babies all seemed pointless, couldnt walk - couldnt talk and then to only gorw up human - what the hell, fuck them kids - his favorite movie was raising arizona oh the thought of snuffing out the life of  nathan junior made his eyes sparkle besides it was obvious to him the hot weather was simply too many people in one place all of them at some point babies et cetera.
