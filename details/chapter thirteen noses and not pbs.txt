in the past, i have sometimes refrained from reading the work of others while writing but somehow i have not had the feeling here -

on the heels of the iron book i found a sort of heir, it is called the turner diaries - very blatanly censored even much more than the iron heel - 

they say, it is anti-something and racist...however going through the early chapters i thought one could say the exact opposite as a sort of dystopian nightmare or the like yet at glance at the author is seems he is clearly labeled as anti-something or perhaps against everything - 

so maybe it is a subversive manifesto but if so why give it that much more power by censorship? 

it is sunday, i dreamed clearly a bare blue bed with a girl next to me - emilee? honestly i could not tell since in the scene we were mutual and i knew who she was - 

i had made love to her quickly and gone to sleep although my lust was throbbing with wanting -

i awoke in some sort of intimate conversation with my cousin's wife in miami - we spoke very often until recently when she visited and i didn't see her only heard in a cut off conversation -

i watched rabbit hole enchanted at seeing peter weller - i researched class of seven and glanced at picard - being at a sort of crossroads with 100 at the list which i am leaning for the great but after fleabag?

maybe fatal instinct oh look another fatal instinct -

even some romanoff's - no comment - 

i decided before cooking to give up on the wagner book and put place forster instead - 

the meal excellent and what is more leftovers for tomorrow - 

back to tyranny, discovered that vaccine theories are not allowed, not even if you are a kennedy - injected autism - i can't see how or why it would be a "thing" if wrong then why worry, if right then goodly in terms of possible prevention - no?

very few "medicines" in fact come without side effects and very often the recall is the norm -

well, no matter, i feel extremely happy but my pleasure is all due to emilee -
