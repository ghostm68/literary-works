As the following evening leans into midnight - he feels the creeping shadows under the hint of rain...

He'd forgot, while writing the previous chapter, all about the broken red headphones - it felt as if a physical struggle fight yet he could see no one that could be pointed to as he stepped out that day for no special reason - Ah yes, a series of headsets, well that sounds too good when recording - why on earth would he want a clean sound? He can't imagine -

In the dream a bunched group trying to get at a door - 

After a while, he even stopped trying to purchase them, nobody was going to pay back the loss - 

it was Sunday and he had wanted to spend it with Grace Kelly - he lobbied for the country girl and made pasta - 

The thought of Lara inspired him to augment the list, he wanted to credit her with the poster design knowing that he would not have got it otherwise yet in being reluctant to watermark it he could not come up with a neat way of doing so...

as he took a minute for french vanilla, a glance at lemonde formed some sort of instant portal into a theory - a horrifying thought which turned his procrastination on its head and seemed to hand him a blank page which he was required well obligated to pen - post posture postulation -

something along the lines of -

a collective intent to erase any favorable witness, since the gas leak did not suffice, 

"the only ones that have any idea are his aunt and mom, in fact he hates us so much he even keeps our receipts in his aunt's house - yes but we can't kill two women even if there is no death penalty - somebody is bound to talk and who knows what could happen - look here is someone that claims to delete memory in the blink of an eye! we will make them both senile and everybody will think it is due to age and boom no witnesses only hearsay hip hip hooray - he will sound insane to even mention it hahaha hehehehe - but the time has come, he keeps changing the padlocks, we will put on a show when she comes over and take her keys right before the deletion process..."

Now then, the  aspect of horror in this theoretical version of events, is that he cannot come up with a contradiction or a better hypothesis, could you?

He is reminded of the vertigo story, talk from neighbor, which somehow got translated to a second aunt and as she told him he missed the irony only catching it later as if slow witted, he had responded that she should not listen to doctors or define a condition as if accepting it for herself... 

in the beginning was the what...

Aha, there and that indeed, yes it might sound unsound and the proof is flimsy even if all his attempts to leave a running cell phone set up with surveillance motion detectors got caught up in suddenly the apparatus no longer works twice or maybe even thrice. 

it is a shame, despite the feeling that it is true, terribly true, to have to waste any amount of time contemplating folks or fears one would rather not.  not now, now ever.
