forty fourth and eighth avenue rising twenty seven floors into the sky...in those days nightmare was only a song that artie shaw played on his king clarinet and his orchestra -

this can't be love but it's in your blood -  in the artifacts it says the coffee room was for quick service - 


the line we can only go as far back as ancient rome now seems to rhyme, well, with logic -

dreamless the streamed by saturday made next to no sense - as i waited in a turn into social media waitress giving head to her boss. i shaved wondering why it haunted me hostess my four cupcakes or perhaps trying to escape the impossible accuracy of eggs right down to named to be future - like some torture - made worse by not having a sense of emilee -

my dream is to live in a hotel so as not to concern myself with cooking cleaning and the like -

but social media is addictive like news especially when one is alone the twice repeated so i'm a sex worker darted me into an echo which i believe went right through into waking well not the first waking for even in the weirdness i felt emilee here and there -

these conversations kill, i spoke to a relative of that line - what was it - stone template ellington - 

but my last talking kept returning as if identities had to be convoluted -

man jumps from the fashion institute building -

i was exhausted could not stop smoking in trying to simply escape into my own life into my own wife -

perhaps both imaginary - putin on tour - 

hitler and napoleon were only individuals but if we all put ourselves together then we will bring russia to her knees -

i broke the window glass ceiling and cut the phone lines - tedious carrots but even that was not enough to save mother -

like the sudden cat fight that vanishes and reappears, i cannot, although presently being pushed itno that arena athena by castrated leaders, cross from a hundred and sixth street into these arguments in fact into any arguments - 

parachute ava shocked me as i had only right before said i would only visit thirty five wearing -

punta cana - girlfriend practicing to be a wife, kendal end all bend tall - gaglione i found other account - she found a lighter, my bic suddenly out of fluid to match - a man left it at her place - 

am i in the wrong place, not with cigarettes being twelve dollars elsewhere - 

yet the orgy  insists  so fast in my fantasist feelings that i am nearly certain of having cheated emilee -

is it cheating with a movie star - what the fuck is star wars about - 

mister saturday night special -

everybody wants or even needs something, i hope the day does not continue in this style - 

already only a few hours awake i long to be alone with her in the coffee room afternoon  until the evening band swings in to play. 

in reality i am going to make pasta and watch consecration - it is not the nineteen forties and worry that no one is really consecrated or even safe - not that i care about everyone but you must know who you are and obviously emilee - 

emilee grant made especially for my love, we don;t see that anymore, made expressly for - it is down to made in china and what the pro ukrainians fail to catch is that the once upon time peking is partners with moscow - like me i never made the connection of having to wait to be served after someone else when ordering a drink a the bar - all for ghetto logic -

all forget the history to start up silly arguments even short term memory it seems essex not buried by south park but back for more spare press - was it not just days ago again the queen turns over in her grave - will the very own oprah be filimg the coronation...

all forget i too forget having written so much here and there having been railroaded and derailed within my own senses  but there is that quirky glitch in truth that  makes even the outlandish joke a giggle  and the somber jolt no google can hide - that is the intangible - ethereal - evergreen and always growing knowledge even beyond good and evil a certain matter of fact glance is deadly to them unpoetic echo chambers that sound only to distract and steal when they have nothing left and nowehere to run so i see if looks could kill in a pause so still they would, hell, perhaps should - my books tell.
