my sister thinks she is a chicken, of course we don't have her placed in the ward for the mentally disturbed because - 

we need to clarify, it feels, since editing our own scribbles is not a strong suit -

however, clarity without knowledge and or certainty cannot be completed even if we can compete with a few facts against stereotype or monomaniacal self indulgences...

for example - the opening jape is taken from a film, well, paraphrased, but to have to explain it ruins the surprise turn leading into the very few films that i wish i never saw - annie hall not being one of them - 

the one mentioned in chapter five, which wounded me in crazy ways i car cry not to comment except this much - maddie how could you we were friends - 

somehow they exceeded in even invading with threats which is how i connected the other events - 
now made even more drastic by the anniversary of an irish journalist's death - lyra also a constellation -

the best agent is the one who is not aware of his cover and i am neither keen on making accusations or musing over conspiracy theories yet it could be that like a casual curse or evil eye someone put it in the works as if a let us see what happens -

a test flight explosion bookends this paragraph irl - reported as if a failure yet a success in terms of research - 

i reached for a prefix film emphasis on fix and found tau -  inside outside where have i been - the al gore rhythm climate - meanwhile today mrs davis as if trying to continue where ufo sweden left off - 

jenny jenny won't you come along with me...

i am already too invested in the rabbit hole and suddenly waco aftermath -  

as a not so subtle reminder that yes the federal government will loot and burn or as dylan put placed it they kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young -

where was i oh yes trying to hack off the matching calluses on my soles i mean cinema there then now the silver lining playbook i hated so i never watched anything with de niro in it until ironically amsterdam which i possibly loathed even more for what seemed to me placing the actresses in danger - 

you can do your own math on that  - 

according to my calculations that is it - i mean i didn't like all quiet on the western front and i skipped the whale - both lauded as laudable - the first didn't male sense to me and the second frightened me simply in terms of blubber. 

sort of like brando in superman...whatever, my two cents and yes i stand by ishtar and waterworld still -

which others claimed were awful - how the hell do i wrap this with a smart alec hooray oh yes the night in soho was very disappointing in terms of direction so much so i wrote to the actress urging her to study michael caine's method for cinema "acting" - reacting to be precise - sorry not sorry js - ahem. harrumph. 

hurry up please, it's time -

orthodox easter i had six scrambled eggs and four boiled potatoes of medium size adorned with half a green pepper and and a whole red onion - 

i had no idea of any scheme scam or plot but i was certain something was way off the right side of correct - 

for the record, i do not believe in reptilians by the common definition in conspiracy circles - even if lovecraft leaves little doubt about the possibilty but if we jump into all possibilities then we might as well quote burroughs quoting hassan sabah nothing is true everything is permitted -

to me it is like the lottery, often heard - seldom seen -

i leave the idea of blood drinking orgies and back door modern day slavery to others since it has no place in this manuscript - not yet anyway -

in fact i am not inclined to politics nor am i political except obviously every once in a while there is no choice - example someone tried to corner me as anti-gay, for the experienced reader; not the jolly sense but the later homosexual definition - if i did not respond well then the answer could be guessed as either,or, whatever and the like so i responded that the actual question should be about the economic power of any group  especially women because a well off queer is an entirely different animal - one that needs not go hunting for those possibly against him but is secure in his grounds even if versace proves me wrong in some ways...but why should it matter to me what others elect to engage in? as long as it hurts no one else et cetera...on all similar subjects be it racial religious or extraterrestial et al.

to hopefully conclude this topic and return to crafting these pages - i do not find anything interesting or amusing about the so-called president or his predecessor slash possible co-president - i do consider it a stolen election with no content except an empty echo of whatever breeze they believe they can hide behind - worse than that no accomplishments any american can point to well except record breaking donations to mexico to stop illegal immigration oh no i meant to ukraine since that cannot possibly provoke a third world war against china russia syria cuba north korea and any other thought balanced nation that has been colonized or worse...as we speak the kremlin got to space before any hollywood film. i mean priorities, for crying out loud.  how beautiful is moscow in contrast to manhattan?  how is everyone under a roof in havana and not in los angeles? is it saturday night yet, let us all downplay the school and mass shootings with tv show news. vermont, dublin - bitch, please!

pronounced with an uh - before the ease. post-script, someone did cut the gas line in my apartment, and there were a few close calls with reckless drivers as i went here or there one of them so near it grazed my arm sending me into a half spin the headphone wire yanked from the cell phone, in other words i would not be surprised if my suspicion was actually well founded- 

unfortunately.  in any case, we will need to use other writing for chapters five and six for these currently -as they stand - will be footnotes or the like upon completion. 

me, im already leaning into chapter seven but lamenting that the distractions kept me from writing about dakota lee and arycell...social media and bank, both so lovely in an emileeesque way it seemed i was manifesting her beyond fantasy into being - yes a much more romantic and interesting story than all that jazz - 

jelly roll morton sang about wanting to have ten women and fucking them hard because being a pianist was considered feminine - 

no effects or gear at acoustic yet somehow the replaying of scales combined with some previous knowledge of groove has made me feel pretty tall against all the afore mentioned torment -

wagner dictated his biography to his wife and hearing it now i am utterly stunned - like hunter s thompson, he copied the works he liked...uhm beethoven was all the rage when he was a teenager - in order to learn but moreover declined the study of certain instruments to concentrate on composing - i can't translate the feeling this knowledge gives me - a master, a genius, telling us here this is how i found myself. to artists in the visual field there is no surprise here as it is common to visit a museum and pour over established artworks but for writers and composers i am certain it offers some insight that might otherwise have seemed off limits or silly - 

now even the, fake it till you make it, catchphrase takes on an added twist. even if one is not faking per se - how rich, if you are wise enough to get the meaning. although theatrical ol richard was not a fake yet he was reaching far and way over his mortal expectations - a reach he did attain perhaps more than once but certainly in the ring cycle forever resounding even to rival ludwig or his beloved wolfgang,
