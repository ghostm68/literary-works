Chikungunya, I was thinking of the time when Roselen presented her third husband...

Mother and I both - it seemed - came down with that virus - 

Preceeded by an earthquake -

DW, at the time, informed me that the symptoms could persist without a time frame...

Joint pain, so perhaps there is my answer -

except for the lapse between onset and feeling better or normal and then as i have noted...

no dream perhaps derailed by hint of nudity -

other girls, they seemed intent on breaking up my plan - and somewhat it was distracting enough to sort of give up trying and get some more sleep but sleep was elusive and i sayed up working on a list -

somethign of a frenzy didnt help but i can edit it to satisfaction down the line -
