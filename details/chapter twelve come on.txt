dream of the dark city, men at some gate entrance seemingly allowing me through - i was thinking of zelda and perhaps i was with zelda yet i had intently spent the night emilee - vows and memory did not rhyme upon waking - scene reflected in floating cigarette pack lee - 

i had taken a minute to relearn the waveform daw wah wah and then recorded rhythm lead and vocals all in three successive takes knowing that i pretty much nailed it somehow - come on let's go -

yet upon mixing a mystery - i kept at it all wrong - adding and trying this and that - we cannot number the available effects a song can employ - 

i kept thinking this was only for a fun a sort of test drive but the impulse in me was to re-mix so hours at it only to remove most of it and still feel the need to put place the vocal more in line with the strumming -  then suddenly i hated the ending lead guitar - it was as if going deaf while working and then finding something else at the listen - even now i am not satisfied entirely - even if portends to being able to succesfully record later on - 

luckily i didnt have to cook today - leftover pasta - so ymmu finding i had known abbey lee from several many other scenes and loving the fact that she blends into her characters as if invisible -

im exhausted and should perhaps not be writing - a real spree into the cinema list now over 1400...

pretty cool art for shirley grey - once upon a time star turned recluse - still shines - 

my thought on the feeling of the mixing process was that i would go insane if i had to perform live and listen back to each track with this feeling of oh that could be or this should be et cetera...

things not to say in the middle of true love conversation fidelity - does this mean i can't fuck the asian girls - 

sadly funny, but more to the point was it simply a subversive or jealous element playing me for a puppet -

in the midst of it all - the doll took off her clothes - it was hot, but how did she manage it?

I should note before confusion that i have been faithful in extremes yet feel the distance increasing as if contrary to action - the girl not the barbie -

now then more a diary entry than chapter but i felt the need to pen before heading off to research another film for the list and hopefully catching up on my rest -

the city dreamed turned supermarket and some sort of tussle on the floor - i had noted that i liked picture twelve - za at floor rug by bed in a near see through knit sweater - i cannot make sense of it all and i tend to worry -  reminding me that emilee might be at work i got up as if drunk on my own distractions - 

to wait for her.
