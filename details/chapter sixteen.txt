A dream trembles in me like the train in passing I could not walk through in order to go along with a woman that had flirted with me before we left some street level party gathering...She had walked, sauntered straight through the narrow passage doorway as the railroad mechanism thundered by. She had appeared on the other side but instead of tramping uphill I headed the other way like a man that had just seen and felt a ghost - I had her purse, there was a gun a seven bullet gun missing four, the revolver thin and shiny under the cloudy moonlight - no town i knew, an argument with an actor you might know wherein i made some point about a sister - 

the dead had ended their tour leg with  not fade away, acapella with clapping slowly allowing the audience to take over - they had also played dont ease me which i covered the same night with switched  verse lyrics for emilee -

it was highly impressive, not fade away - not that my cover was too awful -

what was awful was my still smiling thumb cut which i had sliced while turkey salad the day before jane birkin died and as if to make my head spin again at a questionable tomato right under the first wound -

perhaps someone was out for blood - i threw out an rg ortiz funeral home card - well the bottom half - from 2009 - trying to limit liability - 

i had no clear idea of where i was in this book, but given the odds, i thought what is a writer if he does not practice his craft -

i did practice scales and loving emilee yet the second thing i found impossible in terms of unconditionalism -
 that is in terms of not having her to myself -

what i did have to myself was the visiting mother and the fringe effect of sister and her family soon to be compounded by the niece without pit bulls -

another story, but trying to care for the senile is no work for an artist unless the artist is also a nurse - 

i do as much as i can but my understanding and my own situation holds me in despair at times - to even delve into attempting to explain the lack of running water would destroy any joy left in the reader -

yesterday i dreamt she painted the galvan hallway blue and water started flooding the place as i dropped myself into the broken jacuzzi hearing a rumble and walking out naked to thieves and taking a woman by the throat yet feeling powerless like a man hearing the woman he loves tell another man she loves him - 

one could write a song about that, perhaps i did -

in any case, it seems it will by necessity be two books and this sixteen is only random notes to restart the dream notes at least - blonde ice waiting as I savor contempt enchanted at the fritz lang cameo -
