i should have known, to look out, to neglect any sens of a gentleman's obligation as i have once in a while said in inner rage what is the point of being at my position of polite when society is so rude - well before i could argue myself into something outside my natural posture, there was angelina standing hands on her hips which immediately took me for a loop although i stopped for a second to say i felt awful over the mishap at saying hello while she was working - we do not have a way to transact the payment for electricity one we do not have any method to pass on the bill two we can make the payment but in one hour if you return then - then nearly dizzy the fourth time round we can take your payment if you have a visa to which my prepaid steps to bank a man in of all things a red shirt with a ranger name tag asking me to remove my hat and glasses but i can;t see without them and why is it all right to come in with a mask i blurted as if insane although true then cashier was like all of it and i was like all of it as factually it was a trivial amount - hurrying down to make it before three i paid and picked up my shopping partly startled after tipping the cashier as she she unwrapped a slice of pineapple and instead of raising it to her mouth leaned down as if going down on her self created phallic fruit - it was one of those days - pain started and paused without me taking much notice until the walk home - where i really felt as if i had been put through some proverbial spic hell perhaps for saying such things about gee jehova but even without intelligence everybody knows god must be going what the fuck are they going on about? it reminded me as i unraveled an inner connection of the screaming jehova;s witness that used to years ago yes shout on broadway as if he knew a hundred and forty four thousand must have long ago been counted and there was no hope for anybody born after - bore free holes into the ears of the passing strangers and so to make part of santo domingo new york or jersey what they started yelling here? worse logic can be employed - i was needless to say annoyed and what is worse felt invaded which then combined with my constant craving worry for emilee held no promise of satisfaction or escape yet i had heard a song that i suddenly put to use sort of getting it on the second attempt and having recorded it mixed it and released it - i thought it was horrid but later felt it as near to some sort of proof that i had got close yes  even satisfaction and escape were at hand - i recorded the parts alone the vocal destroyed by trying to strum at the electric in order to "feel" the notes but the scratchy clings i could not drown in the mix - i tried rerecording the vocal but i had not tried going live on the mixer, with headphones a wavy two k herzt buzz danced like nothing i had sung then went not having a microphone straight to the laptop having to turn down the volume ouput to avoid feedback as one would with a radio telephone call - it was not great but all right - i mixed with an eye on getting to bed early which turned out to be the next morning - the final take was done a bit after midnight but the rest of the day wanted to fight and i had to fight my own thoughts that she had cheated or worse not even known she had cheated even if on the cutting edge none of it made no sense - suddenly a series of girls were in my thoughts along with her as if it was their last chance at toppling the granted grant  -
i cannot say after a while it was only her and that was divine except nearing three in the morning all i could think is that she should be asleep sleeping not in my fantasy - i felt myself in bed knowing perhaps because i ate in a silly way - plus coffee and or cigarettes - that dreamland had to wait - in the morning hours i dreamt but part of my mind serving her as if predisposed to her service - in one scene i saw her much younger skinny and trembling or perhaps it was the shirt she wore being embraced by contrary winds -  i awoke and heard her say if could get up now and i said yes but in a moment i was out again and dreaming of her but i was out of bed by eleven exhausted and unable to even contemplate the page - daria told me i had one week before school was out - there were angels on her blouse and i thought it was beautiful - reece said something about being scolded for greeting friends with a grabbing motion - and her pinky feeling so far away -
i took a nap thinking of the girl that talked about meditation well i couldn;t actually nap but i tried until i could try no more most likely overly excited at the response i got from a greeting of my own - i wanted to do something, the day was already past me without hunger or inclination except to out puzzle the jigsaw emilee pieces - i worked on the list with gene hackman in mind - i made a grlled cheese in honor of the aforementioned response - pepsi - once in a while i wondered how to finish the section of this book concerning those upper east witches ues
they abbreviate it in the papers recently - does that make my side of town uws - finally a possible win for the cinemaless side - you should have seen the olympia movie theater on 107th - bogart lived down the street a mere few blocks away - i only recall the time bruce lee castrated an opponent and fed the member discarded to strays on the street in the glittering film grain cinemascope light -  the day at end i flutter like a lost sparrow in search of my emilee tree - to perch away the pain i imagine she imposes as other girls try to grab my attention or other parts - it is terrible but it soothes me to think she might cut it off if i betray her - not stepping foot in another and if so suddenly my left foot feels all the weight of all the lifetimes it has walked - was i that emperor and is that why i felt so strongly that coldplay was theft - everybody wants to rule the words - if so a writer then too but nevermind not knowing how i would feel if i were ive as the famous whore in previous ages - some cook some do not cook some things cannot be altered - detail there too the foot, the fool fancies himself a poet - my muse arrives giving me this title and for that instance i feel only right - not just english rain but right on  - i have the urge to remake the cloud domain but i do not want reece to feel that it was only in some light whim that i put it on and then put it out - already she pouts too much - no reason to unbalance anything about her  yet iwas honest and in this back in forth is how the natural protocol in me swirls - of course i should simply do it but what if i encounter her standing there with hands on her hips as if it ain;t no lie columbian pop star the minister shaking his finger of course it had to be the end of the world and all that followed and follows is replay.
