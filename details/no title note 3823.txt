ram dram sam cam lamb what is lambada badabing, boo at myself as i math away the transposed rest of the scale for the root box - saying it is enough to have the couple i can move around because there is no concert - and so without concern i found myself playing through a sort of merry go round with videos,some of this some of that implimenting mostly scales, only impressed by the eight note spanish at the clash and oh what was that other one he looks at the browsing history - -
ah yes tuesdays gone with the wind - - like i knew how they had wroted the riff - 

tips of my fingers throbbing - 

i feel good about myself but i don't have a real reason for it -

the night leaves with me only trying to make sense of the maze formed in feeling emilee left me after i put so much into it - perhaps it was too much and why deny anyone the freedom to escape love -

yet i cannot escape and do not want to even thinking well let us leave it at that with me pretending -

i have the inclination to put her art back on my domain but i cannot truly do it knowing that there is no hope - not that there was before but i didn;t need to confront the hopelessness -

in a fantasy one might say well yes it cannot be but nobody is the wiser whereas in a website there is at least for me the sense that everybody knows i am playing the fool -

midnight's fool in an invasive argument feeling locals instead of my own inclinations - 

i'm upset but got to sleep as fast as i can - i can't remember any dreams except some vague sense of her i suppose from my desire - 

i awake as if by remote control lust machine indicating something she said when her mascara was too heavy...

i think about it and follow her instructions as i imagine hearing her say them - 

there is only a need to please her somehow in some way and i get so worked up about it i not only fall in love all over again but also fall asleep as if her kiss had sent me reeling into never never land -

in the dream i get out of bed and walk to the living which is now empty and notice a rat of man and signs on the door as in eviction notices which i can't understand as not rented or leased i do not want to look at that man and stumble to the other side of the apartment where i find a woman hunched over an ironing board mastering the wrinkles out clothes - i cannot recognize her, a white woman with wrinkles of her own that scowl as if she meant to shock by her appearance...i was never a child and when i was it was only waiting to silently stand here and frown at you - i wake in reality wondering - not knowing how i could have got in those scenes - 

for a minute emilee is not in my thoughts, i look at the washington post but i do not trust the washington post -

who was it that got fucked in 1961 - 

why am i writing this without a framework, an outline -

badges we don't need no stinkin badges -

but i do have a drafty jazz format -

first you have to cock it, gene hackman seen getting a coffee to go in new mexico -

love those flatland skies with floating rainless lightning and his work as an actor - 

let me start acting like a writer and write -

silver river paper himalayan swamp grey red erman's and the one that sounds like bela lugosi -

i only recognize the birch from the choppy marks - some of them alike snake skin branching away in a skyward crawl -

let me not get too poetic - after leaving laguardia as the infighiting within skankbang became impossible i moved into the birch wathen lennox  school bathroom when they were all out for homecoming at the 92nd street y - the blue and white tiling have  a sort of calming hypnotic effect i cannot explain - 

despite all my proclamations of adore and love i want to cock it with sam comer but i know if i do it will be lust over truth -

i met sam through daria - i feel i have said enough for now about daria but what i havent said is my freak out at the similar sight when with hoodie i encountered well no pants at sex and then content that i had not gone ahead with her - so much contradiction, so nice yet seems so cold - 

but with witches as with bitches who can tell -

in any case from one favor at my side i felt, i remain loyal to her even if i do not understand her position and practice -

sam is much more of a mystery and i feel at ease in her proximity but all this is complicated by only wanting emilee as in desire then i need to say go away now from my thoughts before any infidelity -

which i guess is fine but as a gentleman how it hurts me to be rude to a muse - i will play your music but i will not sing along - 

so ok maybe it cannot be written or worked out - 

conundrum bangs its sin balls - i cannot lie to myself even if could lie to you - it is emilee that i breathe and breathes through me.
