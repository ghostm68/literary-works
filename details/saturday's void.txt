i had gone to sleep, exhausted with a head ache rising...when i got up saturday after impossible naked uncle dream penis at neck - the head ache went higher -

it was as if, i noticed later, the hurt and pain all went into the skull as if someone had said it is all in your head -

i waitied till noon in a sort of limbo, floating without purpose -

neither digestion or hunger came near -

i took a vitamin and some pain killers -

finally at nine, i decided to eat something - steak bread tomato - 

strangely i came across emilee's post about loving birds she said inspired by a chicken video keira's boyfriend had shown her -

i mentioned, after a look, the honeycreeper - really like that name -

now sunday i get up without dream memory, a slip slide between sister and zelda in my thoughts -

my face feels rough and i shave - i see keira wearing a switzerland tee shirt and wonder if she means it as a message, alivia in a bathing suit i find while searching for any clues about emilee -

there was a no game hint but how could i know -

ava seemed incidently to "say" something and zophia wore a vest to a concert - 

game companion made me think of keira yet within as if to reflect hookup culture there are others to carouse and produce heirs - a few seconds behind the curtain and baby -

babylon first hour - aside from the era it alluded to i thought of eiza - 

it is nearly six in the morning - i am nearly certain i cannot finish this book in combination with fidelity to emilee and clearly more than a few people do not want the bond between us -

leelee sobieski is now an artist, she quit her work finding it uneasy to kiss strangers -

i can see the parallel - as a writer i would need to make love to some characters and in essence that would constitute infidelity -

the mind is fragile especially when exposed to noise and contradictions - 

i think of the women i "married" and how that is opposed to my current "marriage" except none of it can be translated in never having been within any sort of physical proximity -

it is impossible to untangle the lies and the masks - all i can do is follow my feeling, my honeycreeping love and hope none of the others feel as if i am not keeping my promise, promises...no rose garden indeed, it was not that type of vow and so i feel safe in hoping for my forever valentine.
