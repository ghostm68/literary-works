obviously, i see your praise position, the thing of it is; if i take little gemma all excited over a doll movie; it will lead to questions about vaginas and vaginal doctors...

the margaritaville echo in middle class america lifted away some to make space for a dreamweaver echo -

i was not thinking of news, of obituaries...no, i was too concerned with the centipede that visited me in the broken jacuzzi and danced on my left knee making me splish splash i was taking a bath whip smack stand to surrender it into a flush - 

the invisible man had liked the anti chapter bin gimmick, even switching the potion to my right arm -

dream heroin girls cavorting upon a suburban street not the walkway but right inthe middle of the driving asphalt she's with me i think it's luiza but i also think luiza is herself a dream that one never meets in life - in any case we are being chased by another girl heavy set although not fat and dressed in a flowery cotton sleeping gown her steps like a horrror film slow monster in fact slow enough that i can touch her and still escape her grasp - we traipse out into waking - 

i awake with mother gone, but haunted by the memory - expecting to hear or see her every so often - her tears at departure nearly made me cry - in part i wanted her to stay, nobody needs this much solitude yet in other instances i cannot convince myself that there is any point in that desire - 

i feel it especially at the guitar scales and at the attemps within moving pictures - 

still not entirely out of danger, plastic fan blades caught my left toe leaving a lovely bruise - 

perfect symbolism here, she once fanned me as a child on a sweltering summer night bedtime but in her present condition that is what i can only term as possession by connection the fanning once in a while presents itself as a poisonous wind which blows to suffocate my senses until well, couch potato is a phrase i have not here used and might define the status -

unplugged tv and sent the listin subscription to aunt and co  -

moved some furniture around the way i like and make a few other changes - i watch a nearly awful mob film due to the dub but the meal is extraordinary  - 
a few times i feel the sadness, but being itself so multifaceted it is next to impossible for one person to withstand and pretty hard to explain to another person, let me put place it thisaway dear reader, before her arrival i hid all the picture albums and although i left one as a prop she never asked about them - senility sure, but it gets more intense as a similar situation streams from my aunt - the loss of two very near and dear loved ones cannot be easily defined - does one mourn before their actual demise only to grieve more after?  despite my extensive experience in many areas, the fact is a puzzle i cannot solve. my way is to deny any such ailment which leaves me with a feeling of distrust - a sort of inner implosion - yet there is more, not really having anyone to actually confer with, speak to outside of my sister which invariably leads to the mixup with her husband or ex husbands makes the sorrow that much more ironic - a catch twenty two three four five six - with the exception of insanity it is clear that i was always meant to be a writer - to listen and not speak
