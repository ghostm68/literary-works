The magic woman entered the dream room, a golden palace adorned in the  roman-greco style - He could only go as far back as the roman empire, so it had to be in that era...Invisible to him except for the pale hand that caressed the ceiling extended upward as she sauntered - He imagined a blonde, watching the the roof crack open as he awoke -

It had caught his eye alike "a major a grand prix and a volcano" or "sex and drugs and k-pop too" -

However in this epoch, volcanic activity was reported in the intermittent fashion instead of as they ashed or spilled out lava - 

it was now the epoch of -art if cia L in tell ig ence -
he had experimented lightly not entirely convinced that is was more distraction than help -

much like porn, nobody could keep up or track all the variations - dizzying. 

The previous chapter note included some cut-up AI "suggestions" - 

It was suggested that he answer the door, still trying to get some shut eye and overwhelmed with worry that Emilee might be at work - 

it was nobody he knew and without a word shut the partly pulled back door shut saying I do not know who those people are - perhaps not even folk - within inner vision he saw a mugwamp in the place of his mother - maybe she was possessed but he went to sleep awaking in the early evening with what had been hunger gone unhinged into stomach hurt -

two people jumped to their deaths from a burning building in berlin, daria purchased dj equipment, he had fourh eggs and made steak and potatoes, he had a vision of a bright red electric guitar but the only gift was argument -  martin walser dead at ninety six - 

paramedic lifetime photoplay playing as if brooke had visited, he had a quick one with emilee trying not to think of pufky - he slept to carry a woman in his left arm like a rug then picking up her make up scattered upon the floor- 

after all the hours of late night sex it felt as if it didn;t count and later after rising out of drowsy sensations he tried to make it count but he was derailed by thoughts of daria and lara and the tarot card reader -

the belly rub whisper astounded him, only brooke would know that...he answered with love as now needing to be faithful to emilee - still, her and the whirlwind of a few women raced against married logic -

just like the fevered madness when he had been upset at her, but this time he wasnt upset it was simply a strange day yet as he strangled his cock into submission he felt her there with him within him, without him and sighed lighting up a cigarette and holding back a cough from dry throat -

all in all a goodly feeling, given he felt he had nothing to prove. in a sense secure - a first world problem - 

he wished they were all sound asleep albeit he knew lara was likely waking up in Paris, wrote these words and waited to take the day and seize its earliest yield to be back by ten so as to make up for the sleepless uproar and hopefully offer emilee solace during the day as well as his devotion -
