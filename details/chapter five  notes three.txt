chapter five  notes three

out of the proverbial blue, brahms' third symphony f major a flat major f major - the faf - at the moment i did not  want to be a rock star seeing other rock stars - except for fleetwood mac - interlude rude night - why didnt some tell paris jackson bandaid was too much like nirvana lithium? i would have - 

my own cover of all the things she said exceeded my expectations - in fact there are two songs - one the piano vocal and rhythm guitar and then the piano with lead guitar solo - i know it sounds like im bragging but i;m not i know my limits in the area and i also know that if i dedicated myself to it more it could even be better- 

putting up a picture of jamie to give her credit for showing me the song - drove me wild with some spiritual insanity - 

i had made love to emilee or she had made love to me as if we had never touched as it were - magically new to each other and yet as familiar as our own reflections -

i had slept, strangely, walking with a girl hip heighted but feeling her sexuality overpower me as it started to rain heavily - it was not carnal yet felt orgasmic - a weird thing - perhaps a sprite or fairy - 

maybe hinting for a place in the story -

i say as subsequently i was rounded up and shackled as it they were going to lynch me, of course i turned into qwyneth, you know im famous pal are you really going to tow me away -

then later in the early morning the craziness kicked in - i could not concentrate - i did not have a nine jones  button to push - i made love to emilee again but pulled apart by jamie and others as if within a whirlwind - until i opted to give up and gain some sleep- 

not even sherry could help, it seems - 

paying a bill, dior tennis shoes christ she dropped her phone right there and then as if to flashback to pre-sandals experience - paying early in case of holy week mishap - then shopping also in case of holy week mayhem - master dog the girl with fringed inner blonde locks agreed - if we get rid of the dogs, we might eliminate poverty in the world - we waved at eachother as i struggled with the bag and thirty eggs -
on my way out she had gone to powder her nose - 

i cleaned my room and the remaining giant coffee spill from somehow push into coffee maker after settling it down - in the foyer of kitchen - prior to or as a prelude to the so called insanity -

which by the way tells you how far i am from returning to an actual chapter five - 

maybe im too in love with emilee - or too in love with myself - or even with us - 

i am failing at my own craft - as with cooking, cleaning leaves next to no inspiration for typing -

in any case, i felt the movements of the music, brahms not my cover, conveyed a sort of full circle with jamie -  and it made me feel a couple of things - that despite her actions she is in a heavenly place and that although the cover is by no means the hit it might have staying power in that years or decades from now it will stand to tell how a poet was moved by a girl and then with another girl paid tribute to both -

i put placed the martin away, but i don't know how i missed trying the ibanez since the fret is so much friendlier to finger - didn't even cross my mind!

in the article it says he first showed it to dvorak well parts of it - and dvorak loved it - i have to take another minute and listen to it intently, my listening came while practicing scales - even if i did discover a cool twist - my point is if it was a message, how kind of he or them to not look down on a lovesick loner that was not entirely trained in the classics!
