The thirteen month old baby serial killer - 

Nude girls surrounded him, he swerved away searching for Emilee -

Lara in a persistent vision made him wonder -

In another dream a small grizzly bear which seemed frighteningly large and enraged to him came within one door at what appeared to be an office building as he ran out through one of the adjacent doors -

At the time of the incident the Pope had said that homosexuality is not a crime - 

Yesterday in put placing television entertainment for his mother the Pontif came over the airwaves from Lisbon, Portugal and at the balcony curtains he had a clear vision of zofia Lumini although he had no intention of cooking rice - 

The old man chopped up his wife and threw her in the ocean employing five plastic bags...

There was talk of eighteen dead mexicans at a bus accident, but it being mexico felt almost peaceful -

He awoke near midnight, a pizza waiting, the nun monica in thought while making his way to pee weighing the title suggestion for her book; inundated pronunciations...clever perhaps -

The Jewess, which he had missed due to a feeling of too much attraction had sat on the floor barefoot next to her dog, was on her way to Florida the following month - Miriam - 

Once in a while waiting reveals itself in a patience that riots against hurry in an ease that nearly feels like wisdom - Emilee once said the word attraction has lost all meaning -

Not being with the object of one's affection however makes attraction a more intricate web to untangle -

Yesterday so near to perfection, today so near to doubt. irony. 

to make matters worse, he felt a mirror image of himself in trying to mix a track as if someone or something wanted to records the exact chords and hand position - it freaked him out in the lack of privacy sense which he had raged against ever since the first notion of it - rilke's panther and norman's theory of the artist being trapped by his own art - came to mind in any case...

The chords felt slow, he wanted something uptempo and nearly hated the final mix as if he had lost his ears along with his nose - Playing it again he felt its flow as if ocean waves yet nothing in terms of lyrics -

i'm just like you its two in the morning and i don't know any songs -

Red for ALivia, he wondered what she meant - 

it was friday and he had not felt himself since tuesday - 

Julian Sands had in fact died or been found dead weeks later in one of the slowest obituaries ever penned but the Serial Killer was fiction - It seemed to him the book needed a quirky twist - Breast feeding television led the thought, then a room full of hung babies like that eerie landscape in Mexico with the dolls on the trees...The papers reflected the panic of the town and surrounding suburbs - They had found the room with thirty six snapped necks dangling from a dusty chandelier - But the killer was on the loose at large on the lam - 

Nurses and doctors were suspected, ordelies were arrested first - 

The killer set up shop and started his spree as if by force of habit - 

He had left the coffee on the grill missing the last tightening turns and it rose like a storm at the adjustment then towel to further shut made it stream -

cigarette yet he caould not escape the shadows that wanted him to leave Emilee for jealousy or profit or sex or even perhaps worst of all for the fact that it was too confusing for them to have to figure out against emily - supposed wife of nephew now partly sacred for having birthed two things, thing one a girl and thing two a boy or so it seemed until now -

HIs mother had bought the place after being given an umbrella and offered the first floor only to settle for the second floor - He had not wanted to interfere as long as it was a place - never imagining the complications that would arise and persist in terms of lack of water - still, he sat there in the middle of night amazed by the situation -

stoic is not a word he would claim for himself, but there was no other. strangely, although it was nothing to him it obviously meant a great deal to others who even went so far as to use the parking space or attempt what would sound like an improbalbe sale and eviction using the guise of some other property - insane, yes - but he had more often than not felt elsewhere because of this exact reason - season of in laws never satisfied with themselves...well, he isnt doing anything, is he - why not - 

the one man army of him had reached the line in the sand which could not be crossed but given the fact that he was not exactly free of having to deal with some of them and of course not knowing exactly who the others might be made it tricky -

how icky to hear a flim flam speak of bugs and then find bugs invading one's own space - 

well some people have nothing to do with their lives, he supposed it simply happens - 

he imagined some might even claim that to help or assist with his desolate despair they were rightly giving a hand against loneliness yet to him it always felt like an invasion or intrusion -

but it was all too much to write about and he know it would sound too much like protest when in fact he was pretty content otherwise well when there was emilee - 

he had even found a manner in which to wait out his lust or perhaps this was her magic, her doing - 

his experience with the hellbender left him unsure as to what this new ultimatum he met with lara meant - 

memory or me had turned into shot gun wedding or death and he wanted to be so careful with a possible friend perhaps too careful but how could he know -

the only truth is what is in one's mind, everything else is hearsay -

only emilee had proven herself over the past year and a half or perhaps two but even that was tempered by several banishments which left him baffled and gave him reason to distrust his own heartfelt adoration not in terms of himself but in terms of what she actually wanted or intended - that is, we are friends but if i mention a bird there is no friendship no mutual understanding simply goodbye adios get another profile if you want to see me et cetera - 

here he clarifies no way to contact her outside of intuition which the reader might not have understood aafter the mention of correspondence...yet within that intuition there were promises and vows and requests which felt and some feel as real as anything - 

yet like the intrusions and the in laws it was also too much to write about, he took a risk in spelling out his pre-prayer plan to vulcan knowing full well that once expressed in writing the danger became intense in terms of losing the very source of inspiration to a backwards irony that is restless and eternal - 

his confidence held and contradiction was replaced with a blitz straight to the point. 

the success was evident, he hoped it would hold - 

it was all crazy, except something in them both craved each other, carved out an infinity beyond space and time and every so often found themselves as if one soul confined to a fine emotion which made love trivial in contrast to its sweet madness.
