yes, hello, this is carolyn, how are you jen?

it;s not jen, it's karine -

oh sorry, it;s so busy here at the new york times-

look woman i wanted to thank you for keeping the dead irish dog out of the paper over the weekend -

oh anything for the democrats, you know - in fact we are running a pre-endorsement today, very exciting - like we like to say around here joe can hahaha -

the masculine haired managing editor hangs up and the dark skinned gimmick stunt press secretary sighs in relief - not getting the inside kahn executive editor joke -

the western press ban on reporting the death of a bernese mountain dog in ireland belonging to the president sure is striking against the contrast of dancing with the television reports - not lenny bruce - of course i don't much like dogs, although i make exceptions but that is not the point - 

it even caused one reporter at the post to literally explode - rip. 

so the air is heavy with irony and the silence screams. in dreams the supermarket is closed and i saunter to some other store a mother at the counter a daughter next to me nearly cosy my arm around her shoulders they look similar but i cannot place the faces perhaps angelina but i would have noticed her height - i wake up still worried, not over the newspaper mind games or politics, but emilee and what she could have meant by gold or silver - 

the bus reads rosbelly, there is actually someone by that name, rodriguez - a school trip i slide through the mall a dishevelled guard tries the going out trick as i go in - i get my stuff grazed by an attractive woman in blue spandex - back home, not meaning dublin, i finally feel emilee with me and i have some cupcakes and coffee and a quick bath - 

i play some scales through steely dan and like the way most of it sounds and still thinking of her i recall the blurred thoughts right before waking as if i had to figure out something about her, us - 

i am planning to make pasta and have a film to research for the list - but i am distracted by the task itself a repetition that leads to dishwashing - itself redundant - be the kitchen clean or messy - even with an audiobook it still feels like wasting time - i want to make more money in order not to have to deal with these situations but in writing or speaking of it always sounds to me like some sort of protest although i am somewhat content...

exhale, what town which ship - we are supposed to segue from chapter four and sorry orders is orders, minnesota munich or was it too good to follow...

all the cattle are standing like statues - oklahama shot in arizona because of post modern constructions already in 1955 - waco scrabbled o cow - fill phil holy meatloaf - dangit my oath to chloe, brass tacks - yes i am well aware put placing dialogue or characters clears the writer of reality and accusations but people have started carving swatikas on the back of juice - but i was taught to what is in front of me and so i said and so i say - you took the words right out of the times of london;

working however cage to exception flood water on the high school known colliers colliery 1923 occurred and belonging some sudden it -

all were boarded, the below mine positive pit backwards is tip - outskirts of the day shift carried -

they don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
but a little brown maverick is winking her eye...
