midnight - unlike myself, locked myself in without a mirror - distant reflections in glanced at news -

knicks over lakers - he hobbled back -

ah yes i went all the way over to the other shop - they noticed my thought of should i call a taxi to get back - i have a callus on my sole true but how does one explain all the weirdness one cannot 

-shrug

if only shrug were a drug - bagger insisting on pulling a cart from behind me another man near enough to smell buying rum - the hottie bouncing back and forth in a hide and sex after the tall spandex spent ten thousand pesos on not enough - 

i pause for rhino - trying to sigh away all the sensations -
gutohrlein - it's not hbo it;s incest - 

text message sister, well i cannot coffee and chocolate with karla - 

the witch sticks an invisible penis in my mouth but the squirreled semen is real in my mouth -
 new york city spiders -

keira talks about even days away complicating matters with kneightly - names - i watch the other fellow - quickly then a documentary on harlow noticing the gloss over in details - the chicken and rice now olived is even mor delicious more with the thought of emilee - 

but the day was gone i had gone to sleep at seven thinking i should have recorded instead of wondering through the songs - bang bang and all the things she said to cover - in other words all the right moves but awoken at nine after no specific dream ejaculating as if the end of days and again and again and mother washing and the child saying is it because you love -
her name next to him in a fancy water closet in a high class apartment - again i was wearing the blue pajamas but in the dream in the dream that baffled and disturbed me into another coffee and another cigarette and what do you call the cocaoine spoon -

vial sniff from possible memory into no dream or drama like a lobotomy awaking to suggested suicide which is more common than one cares to admit in this age of so called social media - 

the songs of course made me think of jamie and even of dedicating them to her - she looked a bit like karla - when i walked in there was a shout and a couple in sports clothes sliding down the stairs the woman said something but i could have killed them both with silence - 

emilee had visited washington and we made love so exactly timeless that the next time i saw her it was as if we were still making love and i was on the verge of orgasm - only from looking at her hand -

my shoulder had been right hurting ever since the feeling of ufo liquid in my mouth and it continued until earlier today - 

cannot one weirdness the all explain - i edited and augmented the list but in a lifeless heroin daze - 

i felt as if i were too much for myself, couldn't even recall how cool my own creations were especially the list - i rallied but kept thinking i have to fix my hair - if only it were a few years back -  

i decide on bang bang and the eight note scale but there is no enthusiasm no impulse to take another step beyond the acoustic - in studying an obituary the valens ritchie sound sends me into an insane euphoria as if the memory of it were enough to thrill but i balance my ego tone knowing how bad it got with a touch of grey - as if i had no knowledge of it or didn;t like the dead -

across the bed i feel the wieight of waiting as if it were being compressed left right - 

some days nothing makes any or much sense - but the thought continues to shock me to haunt how could i walk such a long way metaphorically only to be hijacked an hour into dreaming after all night careful curves - 

in the story the actress says i have always been with you and i will always be with you and this was only a preview indeed a trailer of how i will derail your adoration if i am not allowed to be a part of it -

and as she turns in an exit stage right unseen curtain ann harding becomes visible and beams a smile silently but i can hear it, me too - young man, me too - 

i try to explain that i cannot type the words me too as they have evolved into a blame it on cain party - 

but those are the words she said, me, too.  

there was an incident in the cuban caribbean - years later terry jo duperrault -  i am a traveller of both time and space to be where i have been -

led me now into my own song there was an incident at dealey paza -

of course blubelle was florida which leads me back to central -  

the world has lost its payphones little quarter homes for the messenger to address miles through swirl sound office phone line beep buzz - 

here the buzzer there the buzzards - i need to be pretty honest with myself and so far so good but in full disco closure i don't mention zelda as i fear making matters worse for her - however upon the rude awakening my second thought was gee she might be still in class - 

or is it spring break - ink over the lake - i only hinted at the third person as virginia died not knowing how or when these notes will be edited -

wednesday.
