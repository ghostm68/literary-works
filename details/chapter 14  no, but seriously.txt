I have caught a contradiction - In writing this book, I went against my own instinct in terms of making refrences to other books - 

In the past, I have noticed, within my self, that it is distracting - in fact I have left books to go read the mentioned tomes therein -

Therefore, most if not all of the external mentions will need to be edited out or essayed into some other libretto -

in a dream i am married to a farmer's daughter, her father pouring rice into a metallic barrel...

a woman had said the farm services agency makes grants available even if one does not have a farm -

yet back to books, the turner diaries is pretty terrible and i actually had knowledge of the author from blood in the face documentary - but the awful aspect made me think as i was about to leave it after the early pages feeling i had got the gist -

going further, i found - this was written in 1978 - a certain resonance or even rhyme within the fictional laws ie abolishment of second amendment, the disolution of rape as a crime, and most bizarre; the gender laws in which he seems to have nearly hit the nail on the head-  preview at pronouns...

of course the near mirror acts from the book in waco and oklahoma are what kept me interested...

it is to say the least, strange - and in terms of literature it seems to imply that even an unpoetic paragraph might turn out to be prophetic -

karin, who i knew from euromaxx - had presented an article about her ancestors - witch burnings from long ago - astonishing - but it also brought home the idea that indeed the witch hunt is far from over and so it might be something to weave into this text if iever get to return to it properly -

now then back to here - last night recorded and mixed my idea for the two chord song - it came out well but later i disliked the drum track and then the other drum track with bass which i had done on the spot as a fix which left me with two guitar parts that i pressed a poem onto entitling it emilee - 

soul kitchen lyric and i dwell in possibility...i was mostly pleased with the master - oh yeah, renfield what a trip - as the film exceeded my expectations and left me enchanted.
