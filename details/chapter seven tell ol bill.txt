even without a prerecorded hog honking at the heels of the mosque the muslim stampede made me feel the spirit sly and insidious that smiled at me in the western lands -

am i partly a do-right? stuffy thought to a cough cough -

the real party problem might all be from locals trying to cover up their pig-headed intrusions and thieving -

as i had started inserting the names herein which could further prove cinnamon cooking against the expired bank stocks expanded into who knows where water when -

stolen oil stolen soil and so yes another rant chapter instead of pure beauty - 

backtrack, to quickly add note at lyra then also anniversary of wah wah waco -

but if they got the given zelig that much skin imagine what they would do to yours truly -

of course cheech and chong were somehow immune -

i light a cigarette - 

sincerely i should have known robert was up to no good when i sat down to watch showtime after being so enchanted by midnight run - long ago when yafet kodo was still alive - 

red bic-kering, the witches upset as i cleaned the kitchen but i made room for them in the cabinets -

after all was bubbled and scrubbed, i felt like not much else - except for emilee or the girl that resembled emilee - 

she is attracted to her reflection in others and i suppose i was sharing that feeling, yet in the celebration is it cheating...

the right to bear arms, texas really got me pondering until i had to admit to myself that mcveigh was a selfless even heroic act in avenging what he saw as a criminal act by the government - extreme and yes even deranged but no doubt a statement that it was murder - i suspected later only a man trained by the military could carry out such a revolt. the irony is baffling...in put placing on my list, i was struck by the preceeding tornado in waco and then the near match in number at oklahoma not to mention the urge to include william randolph hearst in the lead up as i needed two other listings before making it ninety three which then coincided with the year of the event.

of both events - but this is turning into a raid into a diary i did not plan to pen - i suppose in having to cook in a kitchen that now feels void of its dirty magic and immense - i was left without the urge to type or even practice scales alongside music videos  as i had been doing the past few days - 

shakespeare dies tomorrow, he does it every year - 

to be fair to honesty, i also hated that kaitlyn dever film where the romeo and juliet story had some sister twist - yet in full disclosure i left it well before the end feeling it as ridiculous although i would jump at the chance to make a film with her or say dramatize a room of one's own -

look at the circles virginia, perhaps this is the book as it is meant to be - 

more wagner while wheeling out my meal - sister rosalie, uncle adolph - i thought that could nearly be me - in a dream i feel myself mixed up with my sister nothing to do with eggs and i start out of bed confused - 

i suppose i am yet perplexed - or too stupid to escape into myself. 

are there not already seventy or eighty notes in this notebook?  yes and even more in the before -

maybe it is all done and only in need of editing - 

but that is the thing about trying for artistry, one keeps trying even after the finish line - except in music where it seems a one hit wonder ends it for more than many a musician - in painting i have often heard artists never feel any frame is finished and always want to return to the canvas so perhaps it is the brush in my hand anxious for the right light -

always inspired by some waco-like fire billowing into the clouds yet my oklahoma is often left in tact - no editing detonation in fact it seems nearly a bad habit, brim - red white - coyote - the white cat -  oh selah even published without a correct ending as the far horizon...

or perhaps i overly enjoy the act itself the bad posture typing even presently in rambling with one leg up on the the edge of a sofa and the other dancing intermittently the chair sideways to the desk torso leaning leftwards chin at shoulder jeez i should stretch - 

but this is all a stretch obviously not as poetic as i may have intended and the plot in pieces yet in the expansion, in the exhale i feel confident that i am bringing it all back home into some sort of enjoyable story novella or even novel - 

stitch and stretch, no i do not feel anxious or worried in the riddle - best record in the country on loans - 

itch out the sketch then rimbaud saying i is another yet i am certain to have no hand in the slave trade - 

we will fry your balls in olive oil, caravaggio's ending haunted me for a while and i can see this as chasing along the unending shore where the ship has sail'd away with my unfinished masterpieces and the break neck speed race kills me without announcing itself as death -

they'll drag you down, they run the show/
ain't no tellin what they'll do...
