in between the stark contrast of wuthering heights and an american i stood. 

from open up the safe bitches got a lot to say through the silent voided bowels of death.

what was i thinking, well i gave up thinking - ifelt confident enough in all i had wroted before not to force a makeshift masterpiece -

not that i thought anything other than potential for this work in progress tome - 

whatever the case, there was something i did not understand -

or perhaps did not want to understand -

a strange pain which now moved through my body had started to invade me ever since that day the near shop didnt have cigarettes and i dragged my calloused soles to the other shop...

all of a sudden and without a visible cause...

hips or thighs, ankles or foot yes usually the lower body...i wondered if some red white reader had imagined the strain and brought it back to me - i wondered if the aged members of my family worked their way through blood magic against my youth -

every so often i feared going out-

on the other hand i had memorized nine scales which nearly everyday i played but more and more felt as if i had not played...

but i had lost the impulse to create music - it was as if the lenovo took with it my set system of creativity -

at one point i gave up this writing although i knew that i could not give up writing...

for a few weeks i felt the success of having several wives but also its insanity -

then slowly i understood as i had always suspected that my soul and my heart is meant for a nation of two -

what is that from, vonnegut, hmm...

we drink els...

dreams i have missed but not the irony, speaking to zofia but kissing eva in a kiss that had not been seen since charlotte -

the room with leafy veined walls so real and so aware of the sex -

but maybe all of this and that is that i was falling in love in a way that leaves not much else for anything else -

as the self becomes part of another - 

not that i slept and ate alone, i worked pretty hard at my domains and exceeded my expectations without taxing my memories with the intricate details of exact codes - 

it is like being a painter that only has a vague sense of color and shape and transposes these in a freewheeling manner which once in a while makes for magic -

but i might have too many websites, indeed i have invented synonym websites even if it is a take on mirror sites....

i am allowing my thrill of love to swim in before the strange sauntering back to the shoreline -

where i could pen the end except - yes except that school, i feel it was meant to be - i was called to it- it was for this book that now might not be a book at all -

well, there are a couple of months left in the school year - perhaps something will come to mind unless it was only meant to be hinted at, a peripheral poetry in the text - 

then again the text might be done and i am too dumb to see that my endgame is already in place -

what i see is that the last two or three days i have reached her in my dreams or she has reached me -

then it feels as if everything is in order - no matter any other chaos - no matter the strange politics that show us an actor turned dictator taking a tour as if to say please promise us you will not give our funds to the turks i mean we are protecting you as you know blah blah blah sniff sniff sniff -

which reminds me i am not being paid for this writing and i should note it as a contributing factor -
not that finance is the point but oh if i could put place her in a no work or worry world...

1983 ad lennox ad - what is left of my "home" -

the last line requires footnotes but i can't even.
