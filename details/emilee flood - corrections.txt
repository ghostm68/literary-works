it is the seventeenth i awake torn between avoiding the mall and not walking all the way to other shop or paying for a taxee - 

i had, been thinking - before being bullied into writing that previous page - 

the day i awoke thinking it was alina - i was wrong, i must have been wrong upon meeting emilee flood -

still i got one exceptional line in the ashes snowing -

the morning's insanity prevailed, perhaps from the thought of sister as i lay - did i not say claudius was it translated to caligula - despair - or about the same time the recall of the once upon time constant scream of the word abusador by some coconut neighbor i never met -
but better yet from not sensing emilee and consequently worrying about her in conjuction with everything i needed to buy -

compramos todo lo que sea viejo, la culata vieja, la lavadora vieja, el aire acondicionado viejo...

speaking of yelling - oh but thqt is continual - it must be fixing something for someone, certainly not me...

emilee flood is sort of a problem for the obvious reasons - 

not to mention her boyfriend ed which as you might not know could cullen or even spic here duardo twenty years i have lived in the balcony -

in nature fish and horses do not mix, why should we?

correction on racism, it is american in the invention of the race card and sunsequently cancel cultural logic -

all irony of course given that the the homeless or educational situations could have all been resolved instead of trying to colonize kiev -

wait i think i saw a swordfish on a pony - no sorry, that was an awful attempt at a joke -

like a van at the corner - how many girls have been taken in this way oh mickey you're so fine - to then silently wonder as i do from my dream which as i have learned could have been someone's true suffering calling out - in the time of democrats well anything goes -

ie democrats since the turn of this century -

i sent a bill last night for the pelted porch - in moving in to 3k we were greeted by thrown eggs several times once even into living room when the door was ajar aha - 

eggs in the balcony - a possible source of all my suffering alone -

complicated while passing strangers two thousand miles away here say i twisted my foot, i broke my foot, or like today holding a lottery lotto calendar, i don't win anything - 

whining without the dining much less the wine in the goblet - 

but drunk with a heavy bag i held on to hope - thinking of emilee not flood the princess of spain three years military action -  the last time i saw her she was with her family and her, leonor and sofia seemed to be angels of some fairyland dream - 

but i am a dreamer, a monarchist, now believing the greatest tragedy in history to be the loss of the czar in russia to an idea rooted in idealism that could never have been that never was and will not be for the basic fact that fish do not mount thoroughbreds -

so yes stupidly i wish her but i know well spain is a complicated land an invaded land and one that even contains a high number of anti-monarchists -

monkey business - i make it back actually thinking what if i don't make it home nearly bookending my thought as i fought my way out of the bathroom well i don't really have a home since apartment ku klux klan went for forty four - 

ah to mention pulp without bukowski but you see charles, even at my station i am not always myself -

and emilee's love is not like the muses i have known in music writing or art it is all consuming and exact in the disappearnce of suffering where desire meets itself divinely to surrender it all without reservation.
