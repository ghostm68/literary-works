i tell myself i am a worm not a writer - if i feel this worry and want for emilee what do i need to prove with writing about sam -

well, yes, indeed, yet literature requires characters -

for the sake of the book i must try to walk this highwire irony -

when gaius julius caesar invaded england, he simply did it even without knowing what was beyond the shoreline -

obviously i will have to retreat - in bed i see her, through the darkness beckoning to me, i can love you better than her, i will hold you and cherish you - the hollywood poster seems to flicker as if uma thurman is actually smoking - it is a collage with the pulp ficition frame at its center - i don't remember the plot of that film exactly and never understood the backwards details in subsequent films by that director -
drizzle of distraction - i don't say anything, i'm too satisfied with emilee even if it is a lie -

i linger for a minute with maya as if drifting from place to place in a new york city daze - the silver chains adorning her neck attracted me - but i did not comment -

i slept then it seems back in my room apartment 3k - i  could sense myself at ease yet hearing some rumble sound entwined with sirens and steps - it sounded as if someone was being raided, arrested, i felt nervous - like elvis not feeling at home if he didnt smell the trash - are they coming to get me for thinking -

i spring out of bed exactly nervous and suddenly realize it feels like emilee thinks she is losing me and her paranoia reached me like panic attack -

but if this is a book about witches, then that would be contradictary to logic as her craft if we call it that has carved me into her slave -

i return to sleep dazzled at my own sense of desperation both in the dream and for her love -

i get up later as if in a trance - slow and longing for her - i put away the thought of typing while studying pictures of sam besides comer might get mixed up with comier or maybe she puts the thought away for me - i feel a touch of pressure on the right side below the collar bone clavicle and immediately think of her - that is what i thought - anything else would be ridiculous -

i sit around for a minute going back and forth between paying attention to the news and not paying attention -

i sense the pull of arguments from things i said to others in previous days - 

i cannot entertain it - to be blunt about it, i do not know to what extent losing mother and aunt to apparent senility will have on me or is having on me -

i only know, in terms of that, that i must survive it somehow otherwise i will be wrapped in it and even lose even more sense of self -

there are no words for this - especially since in their weakness it is a cakewalk to conquer their remaining vitality and turn it against even those they intend to protect -

poison it is to hear hear or see see what is sound sound or shown shown - 

antidote writing is not for pity, i already know there is no sympathy anywhere near...

before waking i feel my isolation but surrounded as if in the center of a slave ship wherein they are standing around me waiting for me to navigate -

the hours fly at noon i feel excitement at the thought of her but thinking she as work i turn to my guitar presenting myself a dm c g which leads to giving the other laptop a chance - somehow the quipment drains the battery from sixty three percent to locked in what seemed to me only minutes but i had been trying out more than several grooves - i plug it in and finish adding bass and piano and an additional or secondary groove - i feel for a moment that we wrote it together but i also was hoping it wasnt the case as i had yet to shave or save myself from the unbathed or brushed business that was still with me -

after shaving i made coffee and felt my conversation with sam went well, yes i think you are beautiful and inspiring but i am lesbians with emilee -

in prose of course i could play it up as playing hard to get and continue from there, through hall it is a hellbender thought followed by a reece grubbs thought ah yes do i return the cloud to emilee even after what i have been through?

well, although i want to, i have to stand my ground at least for now -  yesterday as i contemplated this very point i suspected there had been some negotiation that did not involve me even if it is my domain and that troubled me - fakes and posers bouncing in as if sent for or by - it could be - 

back in ancient rome i am told that before her reincarnation in asia ive fang was none other than messalina - i wish for a minute to confer with graves -  the one who died during the war, but it was only the one time -

she was married to clau clau claudius - they say clodio also lost his mind perhaps from shooting himself in the foot while cleaning his gun -  wouldn't you?

passed away without being seen - i am going to clean the kitchen some and see how to further avoid fathers and forefathers for the sake of the matriarchy. or at least music.
