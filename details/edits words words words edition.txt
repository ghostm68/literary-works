writing a note quickly makes the writer once in a while feel as if his readers are also in possession of the meaning or the reference...

obviously, not the case, atleast not always -

clarifications follow for the note entitled words words words -

a few years ago, after meeting havana as it were, i encountered some sort of back spasm which knocked me for a loop -

this is what i subsequently penned in the unedited red/white -

last year or a year and a half ago, a different sensation happened upon me while walking back from aunt's house- a pain at the hips, similar to something felt more in passing after meeting ive fang -

but on this occasion more pronounced, i remember it as if being possessed and i put placed it down to the maid which i suspect was covering up the murder of a former boss in claiming it was suicide -

not to mention her son had been in some sort of body mangling accident...

but we cannot jump to conclusions, even if a similar pain spoke again after seeing her at the delivery of some stray items after that house was reportedly sold-

in terms of that- everything was pretty much all right until the mentioned walk - 

as the callouses were nearly healed then, they reverted it seems to unhealed -

yet i cannot see a direct link link between them and the sudden onset of a hurt ankle or thigh or hips et cetera -

it is the predawn of valentines day and except a bit of nose congestion i feel fine all but the hint of a tingle at my soles -

previously very active around the house to boot - 

now then the school, means the school, i like the girl but outside of the school it does not make sense for the book - daria, that is daria, going to syracuse -
birthday two days ago celebrated at hotel with streamers and sexy earrings -

her irony is lovely like her rotary pink phone -

in any case the subject of my satisfaction is emilee,
emilee the dream, emilee the everything -

she actually posted yesterday and i was beside myself with euphoria as she liked and responded to my plea, talk or no talk be my valentine.

heart on an envelope.
