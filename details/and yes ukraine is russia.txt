i made, nearly amazing myself, acouple of discoveries by happenstance -

concerning the list - first a strangely titled trilogy which dealt with a witch that had been killed but kept returning, possessing residents of her town until they resorted to murder -

it was from a streaming service but high quality in the way things are usually made now and i note it as it appears to heve been released all in the same week or perhaps day as if to serve the binge watching society -

i only skipped through it - but weirdly sadie in the second reel caught my eye and led to make what might well be an interesting poster, animated at the side and inverted color at the center -

all this led to the other list wherein of all things "news to us" and later i switched an ad for electronics in the 30s for something presley posted but as i edited i saw clearly the resemblance - i mean the other sadie -

do i complete this book or continue making stray notes - in my dream ava and emilee were with me on a train - filtered perhaps from zophia's train journey -
they were smoking hand rolled cigarettes - i had just liked two of emilee's weeds insights -

but they were not speaking to me nearly turning away and the dream faded as if i had been crowded by my own thoughts - crawling into some sort of discussion with mother although it had been a while to dream of her - usually there is no talking as far as the scenes i recall - 

so i got up early but feeling a bit off even if the illy coffee was delicious -

my days now are all worry over emilee - i intend that as a sweetness not a protest-  

bread, i literally was not hungry and only ate the other meal so it would not spoil - in the russian novel, which is not very poetic and at turns rustic or even trite there was a standout line; the men sat shoulder to shoulder like seeds in a sunflower...

as pretty her - i position myself for the note yet my thoughts are swimming across different oceans with the waves of what i inflicted upon my mind -

bloodline and maya, a perfect irony if only the reader knew beforehand that i had played at the electronic game (battling inflation) while also commenting on something about her and then defending myself from the racist label - the quick card that removes logic like a mob mentality tampon on a period harrumph -

one wonders to what extent they mean to fuss and fight over equality when it never was or will be -

what words- well, slowly i understood the genius of burroughs - rub out the word hitler and you rub out the word jew - 

one cany deny the brilliance of the third reich all day long but one step into israel and the shine is blinding -

established by and obviously maintained by the self same doctrine -

not that i said anything remotely against any culture or heritage hell i didn;t think it either, someone simply wanted to postulate vile bile from their inner hot air ballon -

fairly simple to comprehend, otherwise why all the locked doors all over the world if not to keep out those and them that do not belong with us and we -

i have two other inclinations to pen, but one of them is going to upset me - it being about locals in proximity  and how nobody could or would understand the hatred without knowing the entire context of intrusion -

perhaps when i can get drugs in me - it will make a truly disgusting tale - 

detail however should be noted as it was introduced -
i walked slowly for shopping lamenting later having forgot the pasta - the pain strangely on my right side and for a minute on my left foot but leaving the groceries to pay the phone bill in order to calculate how many packs of cigarettes to get -  i stood shocked, painless, normal, as i waited for the cashier with no bodily trouble and emilee in my thoughts although that is usually the case but point being no discomfort pressing any side of me until standing at my door and stepping into the apartment as if it had missed me and wanted revenge well then there was the pain at both sides even numbing my cock and ass like a topical anesthesia which one feels only as a some sort of foreign tingle - 

weird, yes, i wish i could put place it into more a story form, but i might not be actually writing this book -

anyway it was similar in surprise as the headache sudden and throbbing after the meal and the audiobook which i took to so as to escape the chruch hymns from the building in the back and the memory of street seller insanity going on seven years yelling avocado which i hear even if i don't at this point -

i do fear, aside from the murders it can and has possibly already caused in the nation, that it  oh look commas mister dash - that it deeply disturbs the thought process, the inner voice, and even logic.

it is a type of rape and i cannot fathom how it is allowed - it is a violent insistance upon the same point day in and day out - avocado -

a fine food, had some from the shopping myself, but even that has become a peril - 

the roar echoes as if everyday is supposed to be the same in the wildly misguided plan of a city that does not see the inherent danger in noise pollution.

against all popular opinion i dare say it is the street vendors amplified or not that deserve sixteen years and not harvey weinstein even if after hearing some evidence anyone might have convicted the man meryl streep termed god well jehova in some translation oh that is good jehova weinstein!

sympathy is not in fashion or ohio if you are a democrat.
