kristen islay, actually a lovely and talented musician, is the woman that came to mind when I discovered  that the adult film star with the Caravaggio Medusa stomach tattoo was named slayden skya...

you can hear how phonetically it makes sense even if otherwise it does not -

kristen is the type of person one feels one has always known and one's love easily extends to her cat - the poor old thing...

i have been meaning to write about her for some time, not for any special reason, simply wanted the name in these notes for a book...

i wrote your name in the book of my heart, it had been a while since he had gone for poetry outside of lyrics and sat there hoping she wouldn't be insulted at the irony of serving as the introduction for the porn chapter -

now then - you should hear how slayden slithers into screams - as in fuck my pussy and so forth -

as i try to collect my thoughts and search for the "actress" with the sleeve arm tattoo to continue this introduction i encounter amber luke ironically only a day or so away from much hyped amber alert which seemed to me to have ended with the news of a five year old child being raped murdered - 

porn can be as ugly as that yet the industry has even outgrown itself - not in terms of profit but in participation - 

just the other day, i liked the way some girl presented herself and sort of like alwyn - much to my shock - she had an only fans account...now it may not be porn but it is erotica - 

it might be more shocking to some that i actually don't enjoy pornography - in many if not most cases i dislike it - 

i do find the tats intensely interesting, however - 

when i actually do find myself attracted to a porn performer, my first thought is how could such a seemingly lovely girl allow herself to be imported and exported in such a graceless manner - 

eva elfie seems like the girl next door, i have not seen her tapes except in passing but i hope my point is clear - ava ballerina came up alot on my social media for a while and when i spied a torrent i went for it only to be utterly horrified at the vulgarity - it was like she was trying to show the crowd her insides -
i suppose the last time i got excited over such materials was utah jaz, in part because her retainer blow job reminded me of something emilee had said and in part because she reminded me of daria - if you don't look closely their features are extremely similar - 
years ago i kept a poster of some girl that worked in that industry but it was heartbreaking to look at - knowing that by a simple twist of fate she could have been a movie star instead - 

if memory serves only tracy lords made some such transition, but then we would need to speak of the word respect - 

it is - for whatever reason - easy and possibly acceptable to disrespect people in porn - 

even with its growth rate and the improbable fact that once in a while it even seems to reflect the proverbial girl next door -

to select a favorite would not cost me much hesitation that is to say katy althus correction kristy althaus - no tattoos if i can recall - 

in the following years only spicy gum excited me as much perhaps for the synchcronicity with ive - 

in these case, believe it or not, it is not body or even eyes but hair - such heavenly strands...

hell im dizzy and it is nearing dawn, i spent  the day in the usual fashion - except i was enraptured with the idea of a different type of story a dystopian time shift beatnik thing which i felt i had to put place upon my domain on the heels of having released the white cat - thinking it would drive me to edits and maybe even deliver some attention since it might be that i cannot judge my own work and who is to say what is good or bad? oh i know it's far from goodly but every so often it startled me with its twists and turns - i gave it a new domain as i then considered eliminating the cloud domain which from the start was complicated - 

in any case the point herein was truly none of that - i apologize for not giving the mentionede minstrels more time and space - they put it all on the line even more than many or most - 

the origin of this chapter idea section was to flesh out some irony involving emilee with monika ertl - not a porn star -  and mazzie paige - a once upon a time porn star - in fact i kept some of her pictures and magazine covers for this very writing along with a note about some of her tapes - 

but im too away in the far and away from where  i was when the concept was born and bred - oh that only exists on porn hub - you see my thoughts yet revolve around her - 
 
nobody asked for a series, but ; cock smokers, virgin tales, size matters, rookie cookies, kelly the coed rush week, violation of jewel valmont, sex offender -

please note over a dozen cock smokers...

i don't want to think about it and i even feel sort of silly having kept these files as if i could present a point that proved something other than my own stupidity - 

there is a way to wrangle a girl, tell her she looks like an adult film performer - oh yeah way to go rah rah rah - 

sure sure, she'll be addicted to your poetic idiocy -

nevermind any of it, she identified ily elsewhere leaving me to learn that maybe love alike fuck can be just a four lettered word - 

i download the video i am certain kristen islay recorded for me of her enviorns in the town where edgar allan poe perished, for a minute i was worried that i wouldn't find her and the concern mingled with with my regret over alexandra deleting some pictures i had cherished - mixing all the anxiety from the morgan state shooting when by other logic we should be content over the orioles and the playoffs - 

i pay off myself with doubt, we want the same exact thing yet i can't see beyond all these intertwined dreams with emilee - 

she - KS - plays the flute, the suzuki method came to mind - the disney posters on her wall - her e flat in country cover truckin' - 

i feel thin, as if visiting myself, surprised  at how skinny - a stranger inside even revolted by my nails which i trim before typing - 

ingmar made a film of the magic flute,  i found out i don't like listz much yet it is preferable to porn -

pluto is not a planet and pluto is a planet - 

we are and we are not - and how i wish against that ruinous ily - still, there are other pressing matters at hand and the song of this quasi explict band here rumbles into the humming fade out.

rest in peace, pullo.
