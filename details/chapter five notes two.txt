obviously chapter five wants to be a book on its own - 

arisen at dawn of the palm sunday - right from the go it got weird and kept on truckin -

i had an oddball dream, confronting my cousin victor at the table of aunt's house, the home he sold - without a memory of any argument, i stabbed him at the high part of the torso and feeling his reflex kick i grabbed a larger knife and plugged it in instead with a couple of twists for good measure as if i were professional cleaners - 
as my wrist assured, i did not even look back and headed out - perhaps to escape criminal charges, but as with the argument i felt no such hurry - 

thinking of it now the man is only alive because his mother refused to take the doctor's advice to terminate the pregnancy as her own life was at risk in his opinion- but doctors can also get it wrong and they both lived -

i had employed the knowledge in a goofball skit that said she should have listened to the md - upon realizing that the house was indeed let go -

walking down the steps in the dream, uncle adolfo sat and rose in the garage in a sort of greeting, outside the gate uncle hector who handed me some sort of money wrapped up much like the package in my hand when i met the nun -

i sauntered for a minute but my mind was racing through the memory of those first strange pains i felt upon returning when i used to water the plants - 

how do you get there my aunt had asked herself not much of a walker - the loud talk from filtered water palace about a destroyed leg as i passed previously -
the fact that sonia trying to hide a murder might cause amnesia in others and catalyst the pain or even the left cats and kittens of my guilt although i left clear instructions - they like pork chops - 
 
in a shift i was jet bound through the skies i could see the trembling lights of the airport - the scattered inconsistant lights of the city and the smog riddled trees but i had no idea if the flight was coming or going - it comes and goes princeton cafe metropole coincidence conniving victor - no coincidence i had gone through the early chapters of casino royale and thought so this is where ian started - banco -
my trace was not a put down but a surprise - like burroughs like me - cinema fanatics - 

she knew he was wearing a mask but still wanted to marry him -

this followed second honeymoon - from which i picked up the slang stinky -

meaning enthused with party folly -

the cloak coin website out on a 503 error - 

the memory of my one way street sign -  marlene schiappa on the cover of french playboy of all places -
i learned keyguidance name, sherry, i thought the dream stemmed from her talk of ancestor spirits and the danger of ancient karma but actually or more to the point victor livio cedeno jimenez had died 31 march - a distant friend of the family when we were better off and recently danced about as a sort of driver for dad for reasons unknown - mom said the news - but sister mentioned it as a the loud man from the supermarket which made me so happy as i thought one of the neighbors is finally dead - 

it was a quiet sunday and i had to satisfy myself with leftover rice and some onions and olives - 

i ws very grateful to have the thrid episode of rabbit hole - the premise now beyond anybody's guess as it could go here or there and still make it - 

my only other entertainment which i would note was sarah - she posted her child's letter and it made headlines - i dodn't know she had a kid - but the kid is whip - please return your oscar it was given by mistake - men at work it's a mistake had worried me what with it being australia and emilee and all -

but maybe it was that - jeez i love stories we tell there is the real gold - in considering it now her daughter displays that sort of wickedness we saw when she made her father repeat the lines over and over -

where was i  - i have drifted so far from this draft - ah yes, i was knocked out by some drugged in flashback between exhaustion and otherwordly hallucination as i watched the show and as i had done earlier in the day went to sleep again this time knowing it was sunday as i had thought at first it was saturday - 

i dreamt of a girl, so beautiful, but nude and laying upon me her back to my front so that i held two points of view from behind her hair and from above somehow - i wondered in awe at her lovely shape and sort of hoped it was emilee but her body transfixed my imaginationso that i did not actually see her face which i suppose is a common failure in men usually with tits although in this case it was legs which makes me more certain it might have been her -
the scene was not sexual, it was almost reflective of exactly a couple that has grown easy with each other -  we were there simply in bed although at the peripheral other women seemed to stream by as if given the chance everything could change in an instant - i do feel attraction and even feelings of affection for other women but my desire is in her hands - the sloppy romantic words don't make the sounds yet i wish to convey - how could they since the contradiction carries a counter current, a wave splashing against logic - but i cannot translate how it is to meet someone in the flesh and not be affected by it when your own love is spectral - 

i got up again feeling a bit more rested and settled into strawberry ice cream and the memory of her -

some sort of bouncy fairy glitch astounded me in vague visual echo but was it a haitian child a dark dominican kid a protest over negroes a pouring out of a little colombian demon frightened that the earth shook and that volcano might go pop -

it is a good thing the migrants go to land not the imagination -

chords to all the things she said and a piano plan - 

oh wait this was juicy - as i hung about the bathroom i could hear a loud television from some other apartment abode and suddenly i was not here at all instead at my aunt's gone home upon the day i let rai tv cook show blonde cell phone call screen and i recalled the floor - the marble like pollock mystery that was so uniquely attractive - then the climate change room stuffy and hot as if transferred by mere thought, the trigger of a sound - i took my bath astounded, we call it trippin balls - marlon brando was born on a day like this - that is where at some other two in the morning hour i watched last tango in paris - perhaps it is the last time i will think about that house but i hope not to forget it, to retain the memory of it to some extent even if it makes me sad in knowing i wanted to inherit it and my chances were not so awful since everybody else has their own place and she did not refuse my request directly - in any case let us hope it does not become a trend, my room, my apartment 3k, an that italian avenue second story home...which to think of it makes three as my first house, chosen for the attic and never actually lived in except for relatives was gone before i could claim it to enjoy - or sell it for my own profit. 

no regrets, however, i'm only thinking into the page as a sort of habit.
