enslaved by the self and or ego mind, instinct and or the urgency of spirit crawls in a hunt -

mine itself clouded by love and the rain of lust -

still i look at a certain set of words in one picture, a happenstance photograph i was certain to miss and it led me blindly into some weird possibilites -

at the same time so extensively filled with desire or horny if you prefer that i do not know how i had the patience especially after waiting all day -

to think that even an older girl like her could have such power over me - 

indeed of all them mentioned. emilee as over twenty is not in the same timeline as the others - 

be that is it may, after all was not said and hardly done, i thought about making love to her with such desire as i had not known in fact as it was blended with the wanting need to save her from the aforementioned weirdness -

all of which one has to doubt and or take with a grain of salty irony but then a lot of it was not vague like hints exposed by ghosts in righteous cheer rising for her, for love...

my belief is that one's surrounding might have an influence and that influence is once in a while, well, strange -

we send in a child with exact codewords and presto -

well i can't be exact but now i see my imagination was once in a while with her reality -

he is getting to near, let us make her block him out, no memory of the input only the feeling that i was wrong all wrong all of it right there in me despite the evidence, the adoration -

i sleep more at ease in knowning that there might have been more to the story than meets the we -

even if it might be foul, having a sense of it begins to end it in resolutions of oh no the villainy has been seen and now must vanish alike fugitives against the truth -

i dream of a girl on my sofa, the one now in my bedroom - i think it is her but i cannot see as i near there is already a man beside her trying to kiss her as if she were in a trance but his mouth is wrapped by chain tied about his head - i pull him away by the head or the hair to be exact thinking it might be her and i have some sort of iron wrench in the other hand but i cannot raise my arm to strike the blow and awake again thinking of her even more concerned and considering those words that had led the evening into a controlled chaos -

might words in a picture or for that matter captions have such effect - is it why all the getty images game?

a tax on intelligence as it makes even the bright lights dim witted in the guess until proven guilt an or worse...

i make love to her in my thoughts as if no other woman had ever existed indeed as if i had never existed and get up soon after satisfied yet haunted as  in the dream sea foam washed white bone back was being massaged but what was the message...i thought that woman is very thin and the towel covering her ass slipped to her hips as she pushed herself up slowly to peer at me but i awoke and later thought what if it was an alien being endoctrinated, climatized to enter as a honey pot into high ranking places -

i could net tell the exact time, three fifteen at first and somewhere in the seven o'clock hour at second -

who is on third, first base...a lost joke i suspect no one would now enjoy - 

a bet and cost ello - another set of flip through wondering - access to hotel rooms - woman being strong armed - the bloodline game flashing through my thoughts - five people shot at white point royal palms county beach -

i would kill every last one of them before they could even step off the boat -

i stop myself from the butchery as her name is the suffix grant in mi -

do re migrain did not arrive throbbing - i pace i ponder - i go back yonder - i beckon her or she beckons me and then suddenly noon, not high but sigh, sigh noon sunday - so in love i want nothing else - but i get up certain that there is another worry in me, some child perhaps, i think of the dragon kid in the egg the tail seemingly menacing the upper half of its own body i suspect as we all do - 

the ant's a centaur in his drag on world, loomis do i write out the same words on my wall and invoke the poets - always to wait, always to wander -

although i feel her with me i have a vision of her -

as if she knows my intention and devotion and i search out the source of the vision, i notice in the image that there is a wand tapping at her collar which i had not realized the other time or times i looked that way - 

golden and needle like, gently in hypnotic sway -

i wait for a minute maybe longer than i had planned but the day has already escaped - 

nice to not have the feeling i have to wait in other words as i imagine she is free on sundays of course any job catches anyone everyday right through vacational stances -

i smoked more than my set up said but they were partly free this time given the points -

i set out to clean the kitchen but the water runs out after i get done with the main bedroom and hall -

there is a foul odor hovering at the balcony as i hang out to water the plants, the rancid smell of a rotting corpse, i think it is a dog the type that explode after bloating for a few days and i step out a few more times to see if i can see from where or how - i cannot some discarded trash bag is squashed against the asphalt and it looks as if  a canine but it isn;t my myopia glasses confirm and finally again i slide through the slide door as perhaps skirt slaughtered a bird in the dirt - nothing i hit my to do list like a maid on mission to only what is necessary and later find the odor has eased away - 

pains surprised me and subsided as if somehow connected to my nose -

late afternoon, maybe at last my appetite has reignited - the left over pasta no need to cook -

she took me and she is still taking me, i look to see if she has unblocked or posted but no not yet - 

she made this book remade and it is still making me dream further into her.

i sense joy yet i sit typing without a smile.
