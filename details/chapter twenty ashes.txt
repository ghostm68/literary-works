bread and mango night the day had waited worn by fixed closet and saved water washing clothes - he had a prayer to write but not yet, what is a deity without patience...it would be all right - he must have been dreaming swiftly as to only recall the concluding fragments - the long wide street perhaps twenty third around seventh or sixth avenue night with two girls one staying by his side the other vamping like jazz riff here and there and the passing stranger she asked for coin as i once had for a kick which turned out cash - he supposes, we were having fun - the mango tree he knew as a child had been sold along with the farm - the initials on what was to be his grandfather's hat - IR - made him wonder if there hadn't been some mistake - 
names the same next door moving in then moving out when the target was weakened enough to steal her keys - but why harp on it now well as he returned from taxi trash a man popped open the downstairs door and then slid up inside next door as if the reprise of so many scenes for no reason he could fathom - rice and chicken alone at last but what peace could last with yelling then door knuckle knock - after the upset anger however, it becomes clear at how good it is to be not them - with never before tried blueberries and news of where the devil roams arriving- yet in the swirling speed of typing he misses his own turn, thirty dead in pakistan train to heaven, ahem, he had woken with the fruit vendor echo - perplexed at the constant avocado shout ringing out against all logic, what was so necessary about these immoral sales? were the spics that stupid? the other dream was frightening walking out of also sold aunt's house with a lock in his back pocket which he placed on the gate only to encounter an eerie darkness that felt so heavy he tried crawling instead of walking - sunless moonless neonless sight only vague outlines of the structures and trees - as far away from galvan's pink shoes as he could imagine - some party with mother made to sleep on sofa - well at least he didn't go meanwhile viewing doom generation where the price is always six sixty six - lisbon youth rally last day open air mass - achoo  sneeze transfixed by the thought intersecting with lara that maybe she meant it - he wanted to write her about a design for a shoe, spark plug heel but not wanting to intrude and not knowing how it would be taken he thought to simply make a note of it - paid the light bill the woman from barahona beaming then insisting he take a bag - camphor - sister returned mother and suddenly his wait was over but the day was lost - coronation street actress dead - he felt empty, hating his music, hating his writing, hating his hair, straightened to untangle only to find it a more fried - jeff took pictures of alexandra but missed her beauty in most cases - story instead of post, perhaps why maybe even he knew it - other nephew arrived like a secret leaving wife and babies to their own riot - no ello still, it wasnt looking good, niece leaving he got the hundreds along with three bottles of ale he would not drink - ink arm link ms grant missing ms grant even when she was there with him - missing her the second he thought of it - missing her at the memory of her songs well his songs to her - it seemed to him he had finally figured his favorite picture of her, she would never guess it was that one, no one would - but it held him as he beheld it remembering all the feelings he had had at that image - like bread not so much mango - in any case, there was yet danger as the word pnumonia had been hurled out as if covid and bee sting had got a standing ovation and now the encore, brando's son had perished from that word once upon a time and he thought about it now in between mango and bread.
