the late night darkness retains a greyness in my dream as it walks what seems to be the college streets where some universities face each other and i am concerned about money and perhaps more than that about being alone and i;m thinking maybe it will be different this time as well as at least i;m in new york but the possibly because i am not the dream awakens me as i seemingly contradict my own dreaming mind which is sauntering the city as i lay naked in bed then getting up to a demonic voice and some concern for the three women i know are going to school there - yet i weigh the knowledge of the spirit world and suggest to myself that it is not reliable even if a certainty.
