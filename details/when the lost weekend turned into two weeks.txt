logging in to notes, sixteen days. it seems impossible. i actually had a lot to write...well, midi gating circumstances of the meddlesome sort...i suppose - 

it did take seven hours or so to give up on trying to figure out the widget code for collins' dictionary, even with the "help" of artificial intelligence -

but that was only one day...cooking and cleaning and wondering how it could it be that even without using water much there seems to be a lack - 


whatever, there must have been some work done somewhere that might justify this lapse - 

language dreams the living shock a girl, perhaps like chloe but not that chloe no the skankbang chloe with a hole in her head or at least a bloody spot that spins upon my dream sight then as if a show and tell before the present a past is shown man stabbing woman repeatedly blood everywhere and he disappears as other women sew the pieces and she sits in what seeems to be a hair salon seat i awake perplexed - worried, tired. 

sixteen minus seven equals nine new videos, cute things of the ritual but on electric - 

plugged in shoes dream zodiac, doris of all people - as if not a second had transpired since whenever- 

for a while i didn;t think of emilee, in fact i can't recall not having gone over the notes except for the scrabble battle word anagram which makes some people sore since i had the notion idea to explore my dislike of certain locals but when it comes right down to it i don't really think about it not unless there is noise - 

buzzing into my reality emilee seemed returned but i only felt baffled - i had waitied to see where the ily would end or lead to although that was only giving her more benefit of doubt than i would otherwise -
what can one do when love is onvolved outvolved
overvolved...nothing hate the love in an irony that cannot live.  anywhay, nothing happened, like that quiet before provebial storms and on a whim i unfollowed her sisters partly fishing for a reaction and partly pushing for a solution - well an encore to the ironic applause she had offered - and suddenly there it was beige flags and red flags the man in question made a comment and she responded - one could argue that leave me alone blank name could be interpreted as a brush off but it only nailed down the lid on the coffin i had been dragging around since the aforementioned scene - i of course tried very succesfully to not weigh all the awful things this meant - the time much more than sixteen days - the feeling now of not only losing a mother an aunt but also her and the idea of her so much a part of myself - there was nothing in fact there couldnt be anything - who could deal with such mounting munitions of emotional devastation, well yes a writer - and how you may ask but you already know there is no answer - any method i might provide as an explanation would only perplex - i must have had some practice somewhere - days and nights floated by and i even missed the tv - i loathed the orgy that formed in my thoughts like a free for all like a drowned man in a deadly fight to reach an air that was no longer there, oxygen that had been poisoned by loss - as she returned, i might have promised to return her position in the list but due to self respect i could offer no more sure i had wanted to be unconditional but telling love words to another lie or not ruined it and further talk finished it. in the dream she tapped the side of her crotch telling me not that she loved me but that she had got a tattoo - switch was the shouted word in the deadly dream when i awoke and all this made me think she had been switched. there was something to that idea given the january ordeal and the possible matrix world of clones and such - i entertained myself with lara cosima and ganah anwar - recording early roman kings then forming the lara cosima protection society but i was astounded when i searched for ganah on my main account that she was nowhere to be found it took a few rounds of back and forth but it had to be that she did it on purpose which i could not comprehend in other words either she had been lying or someone had clouded my thoughts so that i could not tell she had no intention of being nice to me - with the population numbers as they are one cannot reasonably ask others not to pretend they are someone else but the timing could not have been worse - lara herself had sort of gone silent but i had no expectations there except indeed to be nice - in a dream and in waking ganah appears her lip mole transfered to my lip and i remove it with suspicion - 
gianna dior the porn actress predates and seems to predict in part some aspect of this weirdness, i hope i am wrong - at one point i took out the frustrations i hid from myself agains t the word sikh - arguing lightly and as politely as i could managae that it was too much alike sick and so on and so forth - 

i had a wrong number asking for peter in spanish to which i pretended being deaf saying i can't hear anything and another one asking for lily -

i was immediately at ease thinking of anya, agatha turned out to be li linlin, and we texted a bit myself taken aback at how memory arrives at the interaction in conversation - i had not had a conversation with anyone since i spoke to alexandra - 

not sure how that is going to proceed - the pressure mounts, african wardens plan to empty all their jails and insane asylums into europe, i glance at the camp of saints - the fucking nineteen seventies alive in lampedusa - the thinnest line between staying in control and being overrun by mob rule - i felt fear - wanting to be humane yet knowing the reason why we have doors and locks upon those devices further even alarm systems or in my case barricades - i watch mogambo not having studied grace kelly before she leaves me in awe - a shot in the arm indeed - i only find further fun within monkey business - hilarious yet miriam disappeared, i suppose as i drooled over the nazi uniforms on rosh hashannah but i never promised her a change of outlook on fashion preferences - perhaps wishing to have access to that wardrobe department was over the top albeit truthful -  well, yes more diary than novel but such is life - 
quantum solace bond you lost another one, i throw out the can of illy coffee in despair but i'm bound to her by word , emilee that is - grant me salvation from the wreck - these are wicked days, worse than jean dubarry a fair affair but the actor playing the king proved finer than any critic could have imagined or foreseen - too cool to even speak of -  a magic act in fact - shocking if one were to linger in thought about it - switch, i nearly stuttered in mind when my sibling repeated the word urging me to video conference as it brought home the bloody dream - dang apps - gang naps - no maria neverova even tried texting, i nearly feel as if an imposter is pushing and pulling at anyone near and dear - as for them near and not at all dear - like cocaine addicted sharks on the coast of drug dealing florida, i sense them in pain and distraction - the over flowing soil gives proof itself of having been stolen all those times - my tamrac photographer;s case shows me its missing lining frame, taken as if in jest, even the memory of a beloved brings the knowledge that they hounded me into this hatred intruding wherever they could - i'd like to take a survey of people who have had receipts put placed into the the pockets of their mother's clothes  when they lived alone and happened to be out on an errand. in the end, it takes no toll except that if the surveyed were informed of their passing it would be cause for a party not mourning as evil as it sounds i do not hesitate to agree. 

however, i do not wish to conclude the chapter or even the anti chapter on such a note - obviously, i need to concern myself with myself at such a fragile time when even love is vanishing - 

indeed sixteen days or even years, time is not - itslef resting on restless pinions - time is the evil, beloved the hours - pounds the silence i will prove myself right even upon this slippery writing sliding somewhat against decency or decorum - go ahead and turn away, go ahead and run - i have as a matter of fact only just begun.
