Twenty six July - Afternoon rain standing without a clue - My story is about a girl - I make love to her faces - the little girl with the band aid - the vampire girl standing over her butterfly sister - the freckled girl with blue eyes like a cloudless sky in winter - the woman in lace - the upside down woman smiling like a tortured bat - the one with acne so sensitive it breaks out right under her nose when her other sister gets a septum piercing - the girl with braces - the woman playing with her retainer - the girl that told me she'd be my valentine - the woman that wrote me a letter once upon a time -

My story is about America - the insane experiment that continually backfires upon we the people in the name of so-called freedom - yet we are free otherwise I could not write such sentiments, but is that at what price -

My story is about witchcraft, but let us call it magic for the sake of a universal feeling - 

And finally, perhaps unfortunately, my story is about pornography -

She does not have a name, because I stole it and put it on my chord arm -

she is on my mind through blonde ice, marlboro ice, meals, and dreams and when i awake -

when i awake it is wednesday but we are not married -  genitals in a gift box at the florist - bride humty dumptied down to death turkey - greece two pilots dead trying to read a conflagration - australia fifty one whales gone at misguided beach - 

when i awake it is wednesday but i don;t want anything except her - the summer has bought the sun wholesale and we are walking through an oven outlet shop that continually replaces the vocabulary key words with others as if to make speech meaningless - cholesterol and extremism have disappeared like cancelled game show -

the price is not right, in a dream my aunt presses my ribcage as if searching for the control button - the old get that way by learning to be evil, said burroughs suddenly himself aging - 

i am dorothy in a kansas that never was, in an imagined kansas city that plays jigsaw puzzles instead of jazz - 

i play along to a touch of grey, more than a feeling, and stairway to heaven - but in my inner thoughts i am thinking perhaps i should have played when she was at work - earlier -

i ceased the habit of waiting for her all day when i learned there was no work on monday and then all those mondays felt foolish - 

i always think to call but i never do except twice; the first time an incorrect number which made me wonder why there was no message and the second time another person picked up the line and at least i learned the actual closing time - 

hurry up. please, it's time -
