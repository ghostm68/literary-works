as i ordered a pizza, i was told they also have a twelve piece pie -

it seems now one has to ask and pay for extra cheese in this city -

why do we put up with businesses that treat the very source of their income with such blatant disrespect?

a neighbor like a roach crawling at the entrance asking where the delivery was going - then "passing" by as i started to greet the box - this happened before when ordering water as if my phone line is wiretapped - 

some people cannot mind their own p or q -

iq that it takes to take in all of babylon is more than i had at hand what with mind and women gone into ether into nether realms - but i liked it  to my surprise well not the suicide scene but indeed after hating amsterdam with every logical nerve in my body except for anya in some places - i was determined to skip this one -

but it is awesome, a mess that tries too hard for the message - they should have talked to warren who surely understands the lack of interest in the early days of cinema, in al jolson - hell the theater argument in the script can be reversed to reveal why there is no box office - still for those of us that love cinema what a treat, anthony quinn must be smiling in heaven - a mexican lead in a massive hollywood production - 

but as i hinted, i cannot speak with any intelligence at this time being held in the insanity of opinion all day -

i did however want to note, my thought about weinstein goes a bit further - in that if the top producer in the industry is accused and put on trial and jailed well doesn't that mean that hollywoood itself is guilty?

except hollywood cannot be guilty - as it is a dream - 
in a manner of speaking - 

yet there is part of the face of the industry, (we would all be hard pressed to envision many other "producers" ) part of the industry itself condemned.

then suddenly on the other side, or obviously, the games men play over women and for that matter women over men will still be heard - elevator to hotel room, meetings in the rv, whatever, and et cetera -

nobody can defend or excuse certain behaviour but that is not my point - my point is that film is art and art is life and to some extent requires itself to be above the law in a way -

it is likely that i am wrong but i sense that my wrongness is not that far off from being right -

it's the haze of feeling myself returning without words as i juggle the to whom it may concern letters that drop in as if i were connected to all the whoevers built a corporate structure without my approval -

let us end this note as my bitterness is overwhelming my attempt to type -

 hmm one lie - jennifer was in my thoughts as i considered magda and romy and sarah and anna -

yeah while studying the scenes i was reminded of kansas city, seen that so many times it got etched in my memory -

as to why that would - in any case, ten thirty here nine thirty there six on the sag awards coast i distantly heard was today.
