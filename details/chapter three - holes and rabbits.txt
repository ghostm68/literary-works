I didn't awake until four in the afternoon - sleeping naked i felt a woman's lip nudge at my penis -

Usually upon such an occurrence, I would bring myself to some phantasy or other but I always come to correct myself because of Emilee - that is to wait for a time that might actually rhyme with her hours -

Although I told myself I would not wade or wear the news articles, I found myself drawn - first to an obituary and then the shocking draw of yet another one of those killers in america work seven days a week clashes -

I surrendered to my choice yet the thought i feel now has to be expressed in some manner; when the outlandish becomes commonplace, my comrades, where is the promised change and how can any of us aspire to hope if our own children are targets. 

It is eerie now how the so-called president held up a baby only a few days ago as if to blind the nation - perhaps feeling empowered by hobnobbing with the famous - as if a prelude to what went down in Tennessee -  as if politicians could still get away with anything by hiding behind innocence -

Me, I seen the twister and I ain't never seen anything like it and do not wish to ever see that again - it was demon with legs  infernal and merciless - 

I put placed these thoughts away from me and brought my guitar nearer into some songs - not to play as much to go through some of the scales - I found that of the nine I usually tend to shy away from three or four of them keeping to a handful as if it was meant to be - overall i enjoyed the way it all sounded and blended and i especially loved feeling the sense of Emilee as in a vision upon one of the songs - 

Recently, it has been difficult to imagine anything since what i term as no boundaries in terms of my sister has made me feel well I am not sure but I sure don't want to bang bang bang my sibling nor share testicle levels with her current or two former husbands - I mean, would you? well, perhaps you would given the hopeless nature of modern times -

usually, wishing the brother in law dead, works but it has become a cockroach irony and so I must find another method of extermination - 

they hide in holes and bounce about like glow in the dark rabbits when the lights are off - 

on the chance that it is myself deluded, I tried a different phantasy - well more maybe - but i felt the vow i wore and felt how she swore -

and so it is like she said, you know it because you feel it, perhaps in the way cummings meant since feeling is thirst - i mis-paraphrase on purpose - 

little flowers are made for blooming and little girls are made for boys love yes little magic emilee was made for mine - 

to put it another way, paramount has a show with real potent potential  but for the preview crowd they break it up with adverts which only makes for possible ruin at the serious viewer or fanatic - it is like that when trying to hold my faraway love and suddenly encountering them instead - 

the torrent without cuts so much better - real happy to see kiefer got another good one and the memory of who is the towhead made me grin as my legal drugs were running low.

ah but everything except the aforementioned distraction brings me back to her...once upon a time she asked is there a rabbit hole i can go down over some romantic hollywood previously hollywoodland speculation.
