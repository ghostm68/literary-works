march third dream her dream heard kitten cat in the bath pulled out practiced i'm through with love so long without chords what am i supposed to do now,  transpose key major slog - gols - goals, that fly was dead in the water - wasted days - i waitied without resolution -i paly the song again as the passing amplified sound of a continual offer to buy anything that is old pounds through the silent air - paly meaning play -
looking at her post, i decided to send in a contribution - finding the honeycreeper i thought about either yellow leg or red leg - 

her response sent me down a strange spiral as emilee saint spam blocked inkrealm but why i still wonder although i have opted to not dwell or judge including myself - 

of course some things are not what they seem - the irs was renamed in 1918 -

the cheese shop at 188 grand street moved to Jersey -
i put place reece instead and poured out my heart to myself even as part of me still felt her surrounding -

they mystery irks me, but the love overwhelms everything and so the irony burns -

does it mean that i indeed write this book? i had no feeling or appetite for anything - we buy everything that is again - paly -

1931 - the other arm - such distractions - 
 
i donlt know what i meant to say write - i posted on vsco - skirt too, he looked very cute in black and white -

i cried to think my adoration was mistaken - 

brunswick records, tuna - put out my cigarette before i can exhale avocado yelling screaming shouting -

plea to insanity it seems - goodbye to spring and all it meant to me - 

ambush, you saw, i see russia is not fighting ukraine but a clone company created by the united states and co - bing sang with bowie if memory serves some christmas song - i lay again p - it doesnt sounf like him, i think, sounf of other - david crosby also came to minf - sounf of minf - 

i wonder if the avocado is gone - but i know it is never gone - all the flavors for ten pesos - eternal recurrence feels as real as death -

perhaps i created an imaginary emilee and that is what is remains - 

pain is plastic i felt it again upon returning from shopping on the 28th - remnants is seemed all at the soles - i could hardly take a step without feeling my own weight - i still waited - the fool in me is immortal and not concerned with time knowing his foolish ways are strangely heroic - 

i'm waiting even now - split in half one side in love the other seeking the answer -

no questions just appreciate, one of her deleted posts - said - there there, this means all those times i commentized have vanished - 

lesbian death bed - joan of arc as led by a wound - would i still be me without those words - killing it - i cannot possibly recall them all like dreams -

red silk dress temptation, i met that girl in egypt, the grateful played awfully, summoned for why surrounded why for, 

i do not trust another - i'm through with love - 

of course i know i'm not good for her anyone, how could i be after all this seclusion - but as i mentioned the fool floods me with hope eternal - 

sigh - oh yes i am aware there is no equivalent no full scale mirror that you can look into and peer the individual frame - 

nearly everybody at friends or family and the like - like the dna family or friends at everybody nearly -

nevermind, noone does -

now for this specific book - still no exact resolution or perhaps this is the end.
