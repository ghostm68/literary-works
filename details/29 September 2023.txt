i catch emilee's new video five days later as if it were expected, yet i cant even express the contradictions...it might have been i looked away, i tried not to listen - 

not right away, in any case, i go to sleep but it sticks with me like a catchy song -in the scene she is in a car just like the video but somehow cutaway as in a vehicle that is used for filming -

i'm sitting next her as if it is where i am supposed to be when suddenly a man appears before her saying something along the lines of so you want me to spread your legs - that is why you are here, isnt it?

as he places his hands on her knees, i pull at him and shove him away from the automobile - 

i suppose the car was moving but neither of us look to see what became of him - i suppose i start to feel ashamed of myself for dreaming of her and disappear before she can explain anything - 

of course i awake still entwined, even worried over her -

i actually look at the video and see the frail flaw in her countenance like someone trying to convince themselves that they actually exist, even in pink lace and threaded mini skirt there is something ghostly, something that does not approach the ethereal only the spectral - 

i keep asking myself why all this adoration, this passion bordering on insanity but i know there is no answer, some things are simply the way they are - 

i give up the fight, deciding if she ever makes a real gesture then i will reconsider even if i know that means never using the word love...

who knows perhaps i love you needed to be obliterated - 

trampled through dream time, as if a sequel to a few days before walking down street looking up to see a man trying to paint a wall white where the floor splatters back onto the floor - water color carpet, i sense my thoughts of Burroughs and his Nova Express line filtered through subconciousness - spurting white wash - doll house building with a cutaway side to the street - 

then in current dream it is me in a house looking out at the street, the flooding street where a man gets covered in water as he attempts to cross, i think maybe only jesus should attempt crosses - a bad joke awakes the news emergency state in manhattan city - but how could i have known me not htere dreaming with alexandra the rain pouring down madly from the skies music and i take her hand hurrying in a run race to her boat three stories high we climb to the top both of us so self effacing we cannot go long without a line of sabotage not that we could ever overcome ourselves - i can't see her really but i imagine her as a child in those glasses looking very much like a witch where i want to bring in luisa may alcott to write little witches - i envy some of the constancy of her face where mine itself evolved into a cleaver's sharpness from being but down by hateful glances, what happened to luiza limani one day in white spandex the next invisible well some people are too good for this social media world - website cities i traveled all over my domains fiddling and fixing and finding new and improved ways into code hell - hello hello hello hello hello hello amanda in the tv show house meeting a bird - seyfried should be a bird's name - i watch nearly in a binge for her even missing american horror story in a still cant understand kardasheens and the sorry hype that even makes saturday night live stories seem weightier than well not really - if i ponder the matter it is that the first episode held no sense of humour and it irked me in that sense - hopefully it will work out i will take a look sooner than later  but yes no urgency especially since i had actually kept the crowded room waiting now weeks - one says to the other, lady you must be a cyclone in bed and i grin -

fried chicken and fries all of it so greasy not even counterrevolutionaries could save me from feeling as if i had gargled cooking grease - 

when one needs bread  and later even further rice to forget the meal well something is way off - 

maybe it is emilee and the contradiction arisen like confused beaches of salt steps and sand water making dust waves - 

what the hell is a man supposed to do - i put place her card back in the cinema list -  i feel the crazed confusion - this weirdness i could not come to explain even in writing - it must be over but the emotion and the memory are carved deep into my soul - 

to surrender to this type of thinking solves nothing - notes like a whirling dervish dizzy spell - more to edit - more impossible with each new line - 

and still when a line escapes, i feel the loss as if it is reflecting mother and aunt and those women i didn't meet yet somehow missed as if i haunted their minds even before i could mention a whisper in their direction - 

i pretend of course none of it matters yet is all important perhaps even vital - 

when i contemplate it all, it seems obvious - if the mystery is not considered - especially in these days of shifty truths - then there is no costly contradiction - there is only a series of events, some of them strange, that suddenly become the past, the what used to be...what will they say gigolo gogol top google result life goes on without me...to be precise even my nose goes on without me - 

every one sing along to the polka poetry i aint got nobody hiding in apartment womb thinking forceps killed more babies than the baby serial killer ever could - the word itself like an awful letter forcing a pist script...
