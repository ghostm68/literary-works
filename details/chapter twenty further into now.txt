 
despair spiced with desire to escape, always to escape, was someone coming to get me, elvis hears the sirens, are they here - no exit so sartre nose running for office - before the campaign a woman tells me she can get me away from this dream space and put places me next to some sort of loading machinery, there is a man there now with her - it seems they are expecting a metal box to turn into sellable goods and i'm on the lift with them going down - watching their disappointment as the produce does not appear but it has nothing to do with me and i leave without a word, now the clash lost in the supermarket becomes clear - i near a dinning hall perhaps a restaurant - i sit at a table for reasons unknown to me and there is a couple there with a child - i don't like the look of them and spin the heavy wooden chair to face the other side - at my left emilee is on a love chair holding what might be our offspring in her arms and wearing a low cut dress that ends at the thighs except when she strings it upward as if tuning an instrument of flirtation - i cannot see the seed of our love, only looking at her - but another man is also searching her, he looks like roman polanski or the villain from quantum of solace - i walk away with her nearing an argument over exposing herself - i say something like am i going to have to kill that man now and before i can wink he is at the door, i pick up a knife curved with an arabic flair - there are other knives, straight and one with a broken handle, he says to her show me that again and i fly into a stabbing rage which does not plunge but slices at his upper body where no blood appears as he disappears and i awake minutes after two feeling her with me filled with jealousy and longing and make love to her as if the first time as if a consumation until we are both shaking into a sigh that makes no other sound except sleep - 
shake it sugaree in my thoughts - nine videos done, somehow on the very anniversary of mozart's little serenade which i mention as one of them employed penny serenade - my puffy eyes couldn't say if it was lack of sleep or oversleeping - still, magic presented itself in an overwhelming synchronicity beyond the wolfgang - having chosen to sit next to a framed picture of the whore of babylon, the jewish equivalent is said to eat the souls of the sinners, sister of lilith or someone;s fifth wife - encountered lara cosima riding a camel side saddled in egyptian sands by the pyramids - it felt made to order as did alexandra's dive into the ocean - flying witches and soviet night witches - i didn't hashtag the later ones - in the aftermath, i felt pretty good at results - in any case, a new day is here and it is already escaping as if done shopping and looking for the check out line...
