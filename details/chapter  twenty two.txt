Awaking at two in the afternoon, he felt no sense of dreams of rest. Hurrying towards the telephone, he was at least pleased at the return of the dial tone. Finding, at last, the sweet victory of saving his Aunt's antique phone number...She had had it since the sixties, possibly, early seventies at the the latest - either way a solid forty years...somehow, as her sons sold her house, they had not followed up on the line most of the family had long ago memorized -
one version said that it involved a cost of twenty thousand pesos to get the transfer and although wealthy they did not want to spend their money in that manner - the version he heard was that they tried but the phone company told them it could not be done...
And so it felt even sweeter to him, to have it now -
 Sweetest of all was mother without hesitation spelling out the sequence which proved something about memory even in a fragile mind - His own memory confounded him as it seemed to confront him with scenes and details from the place which he had not entertained before...
Strangely, some years back, he had asked his aunt for the old AT&T out of style rotary contraption and she had given it to him. It was unreliable and impractible by the time he took it apart in order to save the bell which gave it that familiar, warm ring however, like many things that were left in the care of others during  moves from one place to another - it was stolen or lost - most likely discarded by someone who failed to see the value of a saucer shaped piece of metal with a hole on top -
No hope to shop for one now although it was his inclination -
After wandering through the remaining portion of the day which involved a runaround conversation with Sister and Mother, He phoned Carolina to tell her the news. She said she loved him and he thought of FIx Vein's Due - recent song by his own Two Skinny Girls...
By three in the morning he had poured the mixture for nine new videos, a bit distraught by the fact that some of the songs were not available to "add" during selection...Still, he felt pretty good over the work done. 
three hours later, after being unable to untangle thought from fantasy, he got up again - still feeling very much awake and ready for another round even if by any logic he should have been exhausted - perhaps the intermitten sensation from emilee kept him going, drove him into a groove - get into the groove - lady madonna - sunday magic, maybe she loved him more than he imagined - all other signs pointed to the contrary, key guidance spoke of love spells, sherry glowed pure beauty and his lust told him obviously she had put a spell on him right then and there - 
yes, it felt like some sort of spell when after stabbing himself at the right side ribs with the tip of a knife as he went out to trash a couple of bags and edging off a bit of skin from his left index finger while in a frantic search to rid other plastic bags, yes two cuts in a day well two cuts in a night, yesit felt like some sort of spell as he sat down to this next chapter note as if a man possessed by his own vocation...no vacation from inspiration - even if the muses never call -
fall on the horizen, tall on the short end, everything just around the bend.
