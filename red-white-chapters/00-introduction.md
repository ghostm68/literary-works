Red White

Chapter One

After the  lockdown, what is now known as the extermination of Wuhan transpired without a hiccup. Hick town, nowhere, China. We can't treat these people like cockroaches, some cried. The Governor pulled out a spray can squeezed some of the venem's contents into the air, as he giggled. 

Meetings had been held...No, look at the outrage; even if they admited it was a military error... Besides, not enough people fly due to economic reasons anyway we are doing what we can with the boats but this, oh this, how juicy, dozens of them everyday why in the second round we can easily start from scratch in India and Pakistan to boot - think of the real estate opportunities!

The writer sat bent over coffee cigarette and keyboard, it was at the edge of the lunar new year wherein two eerie trials in America attempted to annihilate the recent onslaught of royal abdication news while the Kremlin reminded the world that is was all a circus, here comrade, look, two aging elephants have escaped and can be seen tusk wild traveling through the snow packed streets.

Neither trial made sense - one could argue that the industry is based on a culture of rape, in one, and in the other, to prosecute tactics of negotations on an international level well might as well throw everyone who ever held public office in the slammer. 

Hammer judge headline punch penis shaped chocolates and obstruction of nobody here has ever spoken of Ukraine before Spokane spooky...

It startted coming in fast and heavy, a woman in London, a couple in Wisconsin, a family in Honduras...

Pictures of hospital rooms and clinical equipment, well sure it looks right - on the up and up. The images pre-recorded and digested in the collective mind-set for instant recognition...

Asian faces shielded with surgical type masks, defeating their own humanity as foreigners in tv horde land  see them as an unending livestock of human flesh...

The roach struggles to reach any sort of exit, turns over legs squirming...

Check in but they don't check out. Welcome to the Hotel California version Wuhan...

He saw two lovely women sauntering under a single umbrella. Gift wrap left behind. The portrait painting still wet with space for the future. 

Others had decided, that his own idea for population control, the time had come. 

POP he had termed it and to behold him was to acquaint oneself with the awe of an agent entirely unaware of his own cover. 

Many had often cited his near addiction to filing in reports even when everyone at the Branch requested a stop or at least a pause yet now the Cloud sector smiled at his determination and obviously enjoyed the picking apart of that poem story or book from his dossier which they kept in a gneiss structure about the size of an igloo with distinctive markings for each project. Of course, many of the staff hung around to download his music -which he presented without plan in measured doses to the public - which attracted the attention of the pencil and button pushers...One thing leads to -

Another virus.

Chapter one second draft -apolitical-

He saw two lovely women sauntering under a single umbrella. His gift wrap left behind. The portrait painting still wet with space for the future. 

In the artistic rendition, there was no cover. Three women from a portrait note...

Montserrat. Isabel. Licelot. 

With more luck than talent, he had captured the setting he wanted to scene. 

Meanwhile back under the parasol, they were Asian. Most likely Korean. Maybe Chinese. 

A crimson red hair brush, two pearly laced hair pins, and the high flying blood colored rubber ball awaited his return.

It was Friday, the Friday before the lunar New Year. 

Some sort of spiritual sensation had thrilled him and he was excited to once again fill empty pages with words, so much the better, poetry.

The items in question were for a lady named Scarlet.

He'd first met Scarlet while attempting to become friends with Faviola.

Simultaneously, he had secretly outlined a novel which he imagend calling Red White.

The opening chapter poured out of him easy as arrows from a steadfast arm without over-aiming and yet he battled against his own intuition for a few days even going so far as to attempt a re-write...

Here, he would swim in the infested waters of self-pity for a while explaining the alleys and avenues of desolation and loneliness to underline the need for companionship, for touch. 

He'd settled for kind words and was remarkably at ease in his own company. 

of course, there was Scarlet and Faviola...

Yet as he tried to come to terms with himself and his desires a dream girl straddled him all the way into rapture. 

Others, surely would ask, was it true...DO you mean the blonde on the bed or the plan for population control...

He'd sat in the silence of the night. An urge to play his instrument crept up like the snake in the garden of eden but he thought I can't play here - the music goes everywhere before it goes anywhere.

It's cool, this time of year in Sweden, not that it gets exceedingly hot save for when it does...

He moved along with all his notes from Stockholm because Stockholm is not the same as it had been or always was...

The notes involved an affair which he calls the prelude to the end game...

Willing to go all the way he waited for that particular muse until suddenly it was no longer present but past and as everyone knows you can't live in the past even if it is the twenties again and old sports might find a way to repeat it...

In any case, as satisfied as he was with the agency and his own distractions which posed effectivley as self, he still wanted to as they say in the movies get the girl. 

As it happened, it would be two. A sort of double or nothing situation which arose when Faviola with her Persian charms casually contradicted her free state of engagement for marriage. 

He saw through the gimmick, but he could not be entirely certain of her meaning and so he scrambled his eggs of devotion and desire to Scarlet with flirting and gifts to bring about her nearness and earn the state of jealousy from the other lady. 

It was going according to detail or plan except a third party with pretty hair jumped on his bones early one morning before he could gather enough thought to think his way out. 

Is the way out, the way in? Perhaps...Yet there is no faking several many basic conditions even if nowadays one can manipulate location while living in the electronic nature of these devices which hold a good portion of the first wolrd customers in thrall. 

Hallways of always what will happen to all these half way houses we call cells?

Bells in a dream Inka sits in a voodoo circle and although he knows he cannot escaape the coconut trance his vision is a captive to the ceremony. 

Tells himself he must have met her somewhere before...I know you says the line we walked together in a dream. Not his...

Some witches will put their own flesh on the line and she is one of them. Despite the fact that during one such ceremony her face was consumed by an acne as aggressive as New York City subway riders at rush hour jamming themselves into squeeze position even as the doors are sliding shut.

She betrays no fear of the oil preparation and even plays with a kitten which appears to nibble at the white flesh of the leftover ingredient. 

He realizes that one wrong move and he will be enslaved by this woman he feels he has known before in that elusive era named the past.

She says she is in love, but she is speaking of the feline instead of the dreamer. 

His book was about reincarnation and the history of China and true love or at least the one sided worship he wore perhaps for too long a time, but now is not then and although he will paint some of those pictures again he knows that like Stockholm, something has transpired which has toppled what was once true. 

Did you like the gifts, the words spilled out from him like a school boy searching his lunch bag for the treat to have before the eat.

Yes, she said with hair now a lighter shade than he remembered and a smile so thin the unthinking observer would have to call it a grin.

And did you get any time to play with the ball?

At this, he grinned himself swftly before adding, those ar very bouncy -

She breathed through another smile like some strange orgasm she was trying to hide and behind her Faviola paced then stopped raising her right leg in much the manner that a female dog might to perhaps mark territory...

I have a viridescent one, he exclaimed pretending to not notice Faviola and turning his gaze to Scarlet's silver rings. 

The sun dimmed and although he carried no umbrella that late afternoon, he could feel them both under his happy shade which neither green or red was some other color yet to be translated for the canvas, the portrait.
