They look at each other for a moment, as they start out.

DISSOLVE TO exterior and headlines. The scenes in open in 
multiple screens where the manuscript, typewriter, et cetera
were. the procession offers a history of the case through, 
dakota is at the altar of cable network executives with
paparazzi crowding below.

CUT TO medium shot of meeting, altar on left. Dakota
being tied to altar. 

CUT TO timeline of the vietnam war next to hippie movement
 and 70s disco scenes. dakota turns into sperm and starts "evolving"
before our eyes until the eage of eight. Paparazzi bulbs like candles
flickering and  torches burning.

Two men begin in suits with signs that read "no women directors in
hollywood", those behind them yelling "hallmark seasonal movies" 
"lifetime bio pics" and "showtime soft porn".

CUT TO close up, ghosts of ancient starlets only certain film buffs
would recognize - some of them with a striking similarity in looks
to dakota.

Top of altar. network executive invoking BRIM:

     NE
          We call thee, BRIM. O Mighty One,
           The bride is here, O Mighty
          writing, Great BRIM have mercy on us
           and let us continue our plunder and pillage
             of your one idea and we we will let you 
           take the bride when you masturbate.

CUT TO los angeles and casting director. soundtrack 
suddenly stops. a bootleg copy of BRIM is handed to her, she  looks at
the audition actresses against the  wall, beats her chest and cries how
could he pick that dakota! it's not even the johnson one and look at all 
the fine bitches willing to murder for even a bit part! 

CUT TO exterior with paparazzi, meeting at altar. network executive
walks into camera view and raises his arms.

everyone watches in silence.

CUT TO nearer, dakota and altar with a something crawling in the 
background, cutting to double projection when three finger reptilian vampire passes
foreground looking very much like a human otherwise .

moon landing in close up stands nothing visible, sounds intercut static. what was that/
there's something back there / they are watching us/ screen fades to black static remains

CUT TO straight shot of people building a starbucks in front of aushwitz birkinau two poland
next to screen cctv tape on the doan thi huong / siti aisyah incident.

CUT TO war on drugs, DEA agents burning money in a lavish vegas party with strippers
and drink sets,  ads for various types of medication flash alongside along with side effects
indications, two doctors in a fist fight over cholesterol levels and two nurses in a wrestling
match over blood pressure....BRIM's party racing through the turning pages of the manuscript
in yet another screen and straight  into the altar.

CUT TO exterior altar set, reptilian alien turns from Altar with Dakota in
his hostage vehicle, a rust lined blue pickup truck you might see in rural farm areas
 and drives toward camera. Paparazzi near altar in uproar
one of them drops a camera, flashbulbs, they are yelling, waving recording
cell phones as well.

CUT TO DEMON and party reaching the proceedings, he hears DAKOTA
scream, looks through.

CUT TO what he sees. Edge of altar, the pick up truck going into the distant horizon.

ALIEN drives away from camera and into a dusty road, does not turn to look
back,  Dakota is barely seen in the passenger seat.

CUT TO ALTAR. DEMON wildly gesturing to slave, minions, and hacks to
overrun the network executives and reach DAKOTA. soundtrack rises.

hacks struggle with box office receipts and popularity polls. They finally get through with
 the dues ex machina appearance of emma thompson  who gives the english where's the
tea look one eyebrow partly raised and the gang slips through.

     DEMON
          He's got DAKOTA! Who's coming with me?

     1ST HACK
          I'll go.

     2ND HACK
          Sure. Me too.

     3RD HACK
          I'm going, sir.

     DEMON
          All right. Here you - and you -
              (selecting minion)

     INKY
          What did you see?

     DEMON
              (brushing him aside)
          COUNTESS, you stay here with half
          the halks and minion and don't let these fools
           out of your sight not even if the hollywood 
          foreign press associations arrives with champagne
          Don't  let 'em distract you next thing you know
           you will be at the spirit sag oscar awards then
           fondled at some tacky after party.

     INKY
          Who's got the semen?

bingbing comes forward.

     DEMON
          Come on, you brave hacks and minion.

DEMON, INKY and eleven others start after the alien.

     INKY
              (shouts back)
          Keep an eye peeled for us, COUNTESS.

EXT. dirt road - FULL OR MED. SHOT

PAN to follow the men, headed by DEMON and INKY as they
run  through the path in a sweep pattern to head off the vehicle.



EXT. road - FULL SHOT with manuscript overlay - DAWN

CRANE TO FOLLOW as they come up the parking lot. A twittering of
homosexual noises. Ad lib as they come: "Watch that
pick up" -- "Slide right on down." hacks and minion go left to right.

     INKY
              (stops, wipes his
forehead)
          No telling where he's gone in this
          darkness.

     DEMON
          He came by here. Look at those
          tire tracks.

     INKY
          That's right. He's up ahead
          somewhere.

     DEMON
              (looks about)
          The sun ought to be rising about
          now and if the reptile alien is a vampire
          there's a chance he will need cover.

     INKY
          Listen to those homosexuals.
              (broadway show tune noises)
          It's dawn all right.

     DEMON
          Look here.

He points to one of the side mirrors dislodged; just visible as
a first shaft of dawn light strikes down between the trees.

CRANE TO CLOSE. All move forward - TRUCK TO FOLLOW

To look at the mirror they gather. Probably no close up necessary.
Ad lib murmurs together, "Get that" - "It hit something" - "Look
here, won't be long now."

     INKY
          Look at that. He must
          be an awful driver. He's come
          this way, all right.

     DEMON
          And he's heading that way. Come on.

TRUCK to LONGER SHOT as he leads them forward. All hasten on
after the alien.

     INKY
              (to sailors)
          Keep those pepper sprays cocked.

     HACK IN BLACK SWEATER
          He's telling us we can squirt!

As they exit, camera left - DISSOLVE OUT.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

As the men come from the edge of the jungle, last fringe of
shrubbery masking foreground, to look out upon an open
glade.
They pause, as they see broken shrubbery. It is now full
dawn. Use "Most Dangerous Game" ledge set, men coming
towards camera.

     DRISCOLL
          That's right. We're on his trail.

He leads them forward out into -



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The open glade. Kong's footsteps is visible in soft earth
again.

     DRISCOLL
              (sees footprints, points,
shouts back without
stopping)
          There!

All hurry forward in a dog trot. A couple of sailors,
running, pass Driscoll, then stop, run back into the arms of
the others.

     SAILORS
          Look out! Look out!

They point and all stop as they see --

An immense spike-tailed beast coming through the jungle
parallel with them, partially masked by trees. Men in
foreground here. (Williams Process)

     DENHAM
          Great Scott, that's something I
          didn't know about.

     DRISCOLL
          I got an idea there's plenty on
          this island you weren't figuring
          on.

The beast crashes out into the open.

     DENHAM
          Gimme one of those bombs.

ONE ANGLE ONLY

He snatches a bomb from the sailor who is carrying them.



EXT. GLADE - DAWN

The beast charges. The men run. Only Driscoll and Denham
stand their ground. Driscoll fires several times without
effect. This should be a very wide glade to get the full
effect of a long charge.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The first angle at edge of glade, with Denham and Driscoll
in the foreground, other men running back.

     DRISCOLL
              (gun empty)
          It won't stop him.

Denham throws his bomb.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Second angle again. The bomb strikes the beast, explodes.
Out of the smoke, the two-horned beast staggers towards
the two men. They throw themselves to either side.

First angle. Driscoll and Denham throw themselves flat on
the ground as --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

In the first angle, the beast collapses just short of the
men.



EXT. GLADE - DAWN

Its head is just short of Driscoll. It goes limp.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The sailors, huddled behind the shrubbery at the edge of the
wood (as in the first shot of this sequence) stare at --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The beast, unconscious on the ground. In the foreground,
Denham and Driscoll pick themselves up.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

FIRST ANGLE - the sailors run forward to --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Join Driscoll and Denham. They start forward towards the
beast. It is in the background. (Projection)

     DENHAM
          Wait a minute. He's only knocked
          out.

He takes a gun from one of the men and goes forward to the
great beast's head. He shoots it through the ear. It's
starts convulsing, then grows rigid.

     DENHAM
              (after a look, speaks to
Driscoll)
          I told you those gas bombs would
          bring down anything. We'll get that
          ape alive.

     DRISCOLL
          We're not trying to catch the ape -
          we're trying to save that girl.
          Come on - we're losing time.

He leads them off towards --



LAP DISSOLVE - EXT. STREAM - FULL SHOT - DAY

DISSOLVE IN on the exterior of a bank, leading, in the
background down into a hollow filled with fog. The men come
in from camera left and look down. (Fog Hollow set from
"most
Dangerous Game")

     DENHAM
              (following tracks with
eyes)
          There's his foot again --
              (following director)
          -- he's down in that hollow where
          the fog is, some place.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks)
          There's water down there. Here.

They listen. Sounds of splashing.

     DENHAM
          That's him, splashing through. Come
          on.

They run down into fog. (CURTAIN EFFECT)

to right. A couple of fallen trees, floated down with the
current, lie half submerged by the bank. Kong's footprints
is
in the mud, Kong splashing out of stream on other side can
be
heard as men come up. (Fog Hollow Set)

     DRISCOLL
              (looks at footprint, then
across stream)
          He must have swum across.

     DENHAM
          That's out for us. We can't swim
          with guns and bombs.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks about, sees log,
gets an idea)
          How about these --
              (indicates logs)
          -- for a raft?

     DENHAM
          Yeah, that's it. A raft.

     DRISCOLL
          All right, boys, gets busy.

     1ST SAILOR
          Get some vines, Tim.

Tim, the sailor to be used in tree, runs for vines. Other
sailors run to logs.

     2ND SAILOR
              (at log)
          Pull 'em clear now.



LAP DISSOLVE - EXT. STREAM - FULL SHOT - DAY

DISSOLVE IN on the raft, now completed. They have bound the
logs together with liana vines. Heavy fog.
The arms and bombs are loaded on the raft. So are they men.
They last of them are just getting on.

     DENHAM
          Don't get the arms wet, boys.

     SAILOR A
              (guarding them)
          I'm watching 'em.

     SAILOR B
              (helping another on)
          Easy now.

     DRISCOLL
              (shouts, looking around)
          All set? All set, everybody?

     SAILORS
          All set. Let 'er go.

     TOGETHER
          O.K.

     DRISCOLL
          Shove off.

A couple of sailors; still on shore, push the raft out until
they are waist deep, then jump aboard. Others use poles to
push it towards the opposite bank. Ad lib, "Push -- put your
back in it, etc."

The raft moves across the stream through heavy fog.
(Miniature raft and miniature men.)



EXT. STREAM - FULL OR MED. SHOT - DAY

     DRISCOLL
          Keep your weight in the center,
          boys -- weight in the center.

     1ST SAILOR
              (stops poling to stare)
          Holy mackerel -- look at that.

All look.



EXT. STREAM - LONG SHOT - DAY

A huge scaly head rears up from the water to look down on
the raft, drifting, horrible. It is the head of a Dinosaur.

commotion.



EXT. STREAM - FULL OR MED. SHOT - DAY

     SAILOR A
              (stares)
          It's Tim he's after.

All stare as they see --

          Then gimme one of those bombs.

     BOMB CARRIER
          I had to let them go to keep from

from the jungle background into a mire which lies in the
middle distance, masked by foreground shrubbery and backed
by
jungle.

(MATTE) This mire is an asphalt pit. In the center is a dry
mound to which Kong springs. He is pursued by two huge three
horned beasts (tricerotops) who, trying to follow, find
themselves mired.

     DRISCOLL
              (to men)
          Down! Down!

All throw themselves down behind shrubbery.

     DENHAM
          If we only had some of those bombs!

(MED. SHOT of men crouching behind shrubbery, as he speaks
this last line)

A terrific fight now ensues between Kong and the three-
horned beasts. Kong picks up boulders and hurls them
down on the beasts as they try to reach him through the
asphalt mire. He kills two. The third retreats.

During this, the men exit cautiously, camera right, and
reappear in the background, camera right. (Matte) The three
horned beast sees them. He charges them. They run out,
