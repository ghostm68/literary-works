I playback one of the recordings, nothing genius but it might be genuine...what is music if not the evening awaiting the dawn.  136 follows -\par
genuine recordings playback evening nothing awaiting the dawn...i might actually know all the words to tokyo storm warning...the sun has set, the phrase holds a hidden meaning since i am making a reference to a series of serenades...i hope from the air i have pulled something within the live tradition...it is difficult especially when one's voice isn't exactly available for the final two tracks...still, i love the mystery of putting together a song...the pope pleaded with his entourage, let me go to argentina, it's not so much far away and the pope mobile is loaded with petrol...please, call me pepe...all right, but have someone try the fish before i have my evening meals...obviously it's an interlude, it gets a bit weird when the fourth wall is tore down for a page...the age demanded an image of its grim-ace...i don't think jonathan is handsome enough to play the part...these world tours take their toll...gaga please come to brasil, the lady has heard your prayers...is it still you, when you see me again, it won't be me...how excited was i? i subscribed to showtime and went spinning with joyous expectation...uhm the playback on that device would not mirror screen and i had to view the return all on the cell phone...the first night i turned off the lights and i was beside myself with enthusiasm, had not read any articles to avoid spoilers...tried my best to not think of the announced cast...suddeny there it was, shovels and they were being painted! yes, it sounds perhaps strange yet it is exactly what makes a lynch production stand out from the rest of them...i could not sit still and i spilled my coffee on one of my laptops...weird that it was the one with the lights out and after the show the lights came back on...true story...now i have seen all the previous episodes many times, more than i care to admiit, and i even started on what some are calling season one all over again but i can't start without going straight to the so-called season two beyond life and death scenes...they call to me, they haunt me, i hate that picture of the behind the scenes as much as i hate kubrick's at work on the shining scenes because i know that these places are real and i know which characters are supposed to be there...in any case i learned a thing or two by reading the secret diary as well as the history and near the end i viewed sunset blvd too which was referenced alike the soap opera what was that name, invitation to love...i think that is right and if it isn't the whole affair is exactly that, an invitation to love and man alive was there a lot to love...contemplating all the scenes that drift into the background say when the current episode eight exploded or when sarah palmer showed her face as it were...well, i simply don't understand how all the other networks and stations did not say hey let's preempt everything and bootleg these stories...you know that feeling when you are hooked on a scene cause it's true and nothing else seems to even remotely exist, well this was a party for those of us that applaud that type of truth...i always admired the players except for the man that played hank because yuck right but there's a whole backstory that validates my emotion...all i can say it was an undefeated season! i had the same queasy sensation when the network squeezed in another program between the repeat and before the premier for a couple of weeks before the last two episodes which thankfully were preceeded by a marathon of this art work...but what i was saying is that my admiration has increased to a point where i don't think i could bring myself to say it aloud...all i know is none of them got paid enough or will ever be applauded enough...same or more goes for lynch and frost...yeah i know that for the networks it's a business and it's like they have their usual deals and suddenly audrey walks in and says something and everyone packs up an leaves! sure, my thoughts started in with questions and the calamity of well what about this or does that mean...then i remembered albert telling truman look its trying to think...what can i say i still can't cut all the deep rooted reaction lines and yet after a laugh at my own expense i surrender to the higher knowledge that in more ways than we can imagine lynch and co has brought us all back home even at the risk of not knowing who they themselves might be or even the exact date in time.  i daresay none of us deserved such affection.  for he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse...\b0\par
