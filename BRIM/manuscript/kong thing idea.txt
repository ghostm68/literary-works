FADE IN a composite  shot over the Malaysian docks -
Kuala Lupur Skyline dimly seen in background. Rain. Sounds of
traffic moving. DISSOLVE TO -

A group of police slopes up out of picture.

White, a rogue agent, comes along, peering at
a newspaper. He is forty, heavy, slow, but with a sharp eye. He
turns up his collar and shivers, stops and looks at the cops
doubtfully.

An old cop comes along from opposite side,
swinging a flashlight.


     White
          Hey, Is this the moving picture show?

     Azirul
          The Brim? Yep.
          You got any new orders?

     White
              (beat)
          Well orders are orders even the old ones are new?

     Azirul
          I dunno know, but I hear everybody
          talkin' about this writer feller
          that's running it.

     White
          inky, no. all you got to do is play dumb when the time comes?

     Azirul
          Guess that's the name. They say he
          ain't scare of nothin' - if he
          wants a picture of a lion he walks
          right up and tells it to look
          pleasant.

     White
          He's a tough egg, all right. But
          why the talk about this movie
          being crazy?

     Azirul
          Well, there's talk around the station
          about the target for one thing. And
          I never see any poison in the  KL
          plus the patsy being two girls.

     White
          Not enough men to handle them?

     Azirul
          Not enough! we got all the men
          those bitches could handle. We can
          even get Chinese men to sleep with
          them.

     Demon
              (from above)
          Hey, there! What do you want?

     White
          where's inky?

     Demon
              (comes down into picture)
          Yes. Who are you?

     White
          I want to see him. I'm White, from the mossad.

     Demon
          He was expecting the FSB but come on in. inky's getting wild.
          Hope you have some good news for him.
