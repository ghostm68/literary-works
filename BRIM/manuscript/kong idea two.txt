INT. headquarters - NIGHT

inky and the blood countess talking.

     countess
          Well, Mr. inky, you know the
          reasons for hurrying as well as I
          do. The production company has found
          out we're carrying semen, and
          the producer will be here tomorrow
          or next day.

     inky
          I suppose if we make a legal case
          of it with the wga, we'll be tied up for months.

     countess
          With some of brim's articles falsified and
          sperm enough to blow up everyone at
          ruby's sweet sixteen mexican party?
              (he takes a sperm  case from
the floor)
          And what do you think the producer
          will say to these new sag holding kits?
          According to you one of them is
          powerful enough to knock out an
          porn star.

     inky
              (pacing up and down)
          I've got proof, ava, see how she went straight
          anyway here forget all that we got to get where 
          we're going before the intergalactic commission
          calls in another mass shooting.

     countess
          You can trust me to get you through
          anything , I have seen how you understand
           and i share your hope.

     inky 
          Don't get sore, countess. But you
          know what it means to hit the
          second act without action when we're
          making an outdoor picture. Months
          wasted, money gone, and nothing to
          show for it.

     countess
          But still you always bring back a
          picture and everyone says, "There
          is only one inky."

Demon and White come in.

     inky
          White! I was just going to grab the portable  to
          ring you up.

     White
          If I'd known that, I'd have waited back in haifa

     inky
          Meet the countess.
              (to countess)
          This is White, the secret
          agent.
              (they shake hands)
          And this is Demon, the first
          son of an ancient spirit with a
          masters degree in juxtaposition.
          Well, where's the Odeya,
          White?

     White
          It can't be done, inky.

     Inky 
          What? It's got to get  done.
              (White shakes his head in
silence)
          Look here, White. The senator's
          dead and the congress outfit have
          interfered with every girl I've
          tried to hire; now every agent in
          tel aviv  has shut down on me. All but
          you. You know I'm square -

     inky
          Everybody knows you're square,
          inky but you've got a reputation
          for nazi recklessness now that can't be
          glossed over. And then you're so
          secretive.

     Demon
          I'll say so.

     COUNTESS
          When even the producer and the director
          don't know where they're going --
              (she shrugs)

     White
          There you are. I've got a
          conscience, inky. I can't send nice a
          young, pretty girl, such as you
          want, on a job like this without
          telling her what to expect.

     inky
          And what is she to expect?

     White
          To go off for no one knows how
          long, to some place you won't even
          hint at, the only jew woman in a screenplay
          with the toughest malaysian mugs  I ever
          looked at.
              (they all laugh)
          I mean the police department.

     INKY 
          By Satan, you'd think I never
          brought anybody back alive from hell! The
          countess and Demon have stuck by
          me on two trips already. They seem healthy.

     Demon
          Sure we're healthy.

     Countess
          But it's different taking a girl
          into movie scenes I mean look at Chloe Grace Moretz
          at that perfume counter.

     INKY
          Oh, I suppose there's no danger in
          Haifa? Why, there are dozens of
          girls in Michigan tonight in more
          danger than they'd ever see with
          me.

     Demon
              (drily)
          Sure. But they know that kind of
          danger. 

     White
          You never had a woman in your other
          pictures, why do you want one in
          this?

     inky
              (exploding)
          Holy mackerel Do ya think I really want to
          haul a second string woman from ladybird along?

     White
          Then why - ?

     INKY
          Because the public - bless 'em -
          must have a pretty sexy face to look at.

     White
          Everybody likes romance. 

     INKY
          Isn't there any romance or
          adventure in the world without a
          jewish american princess in it?

     COUNTESS
          Well, Mr. inky, why not make a
          picture in a monasteryith your nuns ?
              (they all laugh)

     INKY
          It makes me sore. I go out and
          sweat blood to make a swell
          picture, and then the exhibitors
          and critics all say, "if this
          picture had a love interest, it
          would gross twice as much." All
          right, the public wants a girl, and
          this time I will give 'em what they
          want.

     White
              (rising)
          I don't know where you'll get her.

     INKY
          White, I've got to. We've got to
           have a set script as soon as possible - we've
          got to be out of twitter and make a profit -

     White
          Why?

     INKY
          Well - there's a good reason. several reasons.

     White
          Everything I hear makes me like
          this thing less. I'm glad I didn't
          get you an odeya girl.

     INKY
          You are, eh? Well, I'll show you.
          If you think I'm going to give up
          just because you think that girl
          ain't got no backbone --
              (he is struggling into his
overcoat)
          -- I'm going to make the greatest
          picture in the world, something
          that's never been seen or dreamed
          of. They'll have to invent some new
          adjectives when I come back.
              (he is at the door)

     Countess
          Where are you going?

     INKY
          I'm going to bring back a girl for
          my picture -- if I have to marry
          one!
