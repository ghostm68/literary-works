\b\fs18 BRIM 76 or 80  gold in the skin and now i'm glowing i'm golden finally i get why so many bitches rub this and that on their faces not to mention virgin blood sometimes it feels like the city and having had the sit down with pink secret who told me that if i wanted to smuggle drugs into malaysia i could find a girl with flabby tits and pay off a doctor to put two packages in her and then get another one in kuala lumpur to pull it out and stitch it up with a similar size settings...i tell pink secret why are we eating bread in a fancy east side hotel restaurant and no because i have already tried hanging myself and don't want to let nobody else try it for me...hell, i'm thinking if they beat a school boy to death imagine what they would do to a writer...people are being rounded up and told to shut their pie holes, facebook accounts have disappeared, and well, maybe i'm in over my head but if anything runs in my family it is pigheadedness, they are stubborn folk some of them have lived to be a hundred and six which is nothing in contrast to 121 who was that puan the oldest bitch in malaysia expired the other day...i was with christina in san francisco but don't tell her boyfriend...even if it was only in a dream...waking up from it i heard le pen did not win outright and had competition from my corn or something and yeah corn is good food but to get real votes...stranger things can happen even the obiden grope and rope tour is making the rounds...women across several cities have been complaining of breast discomfort after their bras came into the vicinity of that circus act...to think ringling brothers gave it up and we are left with democrats...a man could puke if  a man were pre-disposed to vomit...at least walls are going up against the rising tide of immigrant hordes in europe...sad though that it comes to this but i guess it is the same reason why we all have gates and locks and doors as for the spiritual intruders well i myself have not washed the sheets this year and it gives me a good sense of place that is until the nose movers push the no smell no tell button. \b0\fs20\par
