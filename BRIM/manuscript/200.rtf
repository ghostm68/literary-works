BRIM 200 To make it new, day by day...wednesday 25 october...twenty 17. Middle of the Asian evening, I'm exhausted. When you take these chances, even in a work in progress, well it makes for a strange worry. Misunderstandings, missed landings...My aircraft hovered over some speech by el or al sisi and all I saw was makeup as he stood next to the french president who somehow was not as glossy. Now, being that it is only a prelude or introduction to serve as opening for the paragraph I could ask myself; should I edit that out and away...But the lipstick, it was well runaway train...and you're gonna clean that spot until it gets that shiny clean...Some cook, some do not cook...I heated up the poultry, scraped the rice out of the pot, and cut through a tomato. I ate yet there is hunger. I slept yet i longed for a nap. Ask the egyptians on the street...who are these people and where is Hosni and where is de Gaulle...I was going to speak of the visit to the airport which I may have wrongly reported in these notes as having already transpired ofcourse not with any deceptive intention...It was what had been revealed in numerous respectable journals, if memory serves, right after the lab visit and the announcement of the live feed.  I should also note that this is not to indicate that the intention of all these notes is veracity or adherence to non-fiction. As might be more than evident, there is a goodly amount of well flights of fancy if you will and the poetry i cannot help but spill or stream of beatnik thrills...Now let me see if the sour hordes will let me get through a few lines before i become entirely who or what i didn't intend to be all for the sake of envy or perceived bliss which makes no sense yet some are confident that indeed they have every right to glue my nose and glom my natural tranquility...more on that later, if the circumstances continue yet let us as ee suggested further into now. \par
