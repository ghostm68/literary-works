Yes, but only once said graves just like that...hat's off to history...cats often to his torrid downloading me wow...now i don't know how someone might translate these tranced musings tracking the right angle from which to case these unfolding events and honestly i don't think about it at all as when i want something neat and clear i will usually clearly and neatly use my sentence paragraph or page...paging kim jong nam's cell...perhaps they will claim he did not carry a phone...unlikely, but these days you can say anything and others will believe you...i've said my sad stance on gun control but i nearly forgot that i also wanted to say how much i hate the phrase bump-stock...it's like noticing the what's happening line pre-tweet and remembering the title of  private email server poetry book and feeling that icky shiver sensation or having people think one is associated with profit monger bully types out for dollars and cents when one is simply trying to be poetic well what i was saying was that it surely weren't a poet that came up with stock bumper car words...crashing against conformity i conform inform me about the phone if you will, foes of doan and siti are calling each other but what about the cell phone...as for his life in prose and poems well it's not that i don't want money it's that if my grandmother were alive she would cut your balls off.\par
