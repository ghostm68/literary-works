DISSOLVE TO new chapter in moonlight - Dakota and nun chat.

     DAKOTA
          -- and an enormous lie, sister,
          all the way across that piece of
          land where we went to see.

     nun
          What fashion those girl do -- that
          girl with muslims on her?

     DAKOTA
          The poor thing, she looked -- as
          though she was too frightened to
          feel any fright. You know?

     NUN
              (nodding wisely)
          Sacrifice.

     DAKOTA
          The lawyer said she was the bride of
          Germany. Nun, what do you suppose
          INKY is?

     NUN
          My guess he look for very big word for this
          place. People here plenty scared.
          You don't worry. No can help.

shimmer gallops past.

     DAKOTA
          Oh, there's shimmer! He's got
          loose again.

nun grabs at him and misses. shimmer  goes down the deck.

     DAKOTA
          Catch him, sister. He'll get in
          the cabins and break things.

     NUN
          Me catch him. Bad devil, come here.

He goes off in pursuit. DAKOTA watches, laughing.

CUT TO hack on watch in typewriter. He looks round, yawns, sits
down and makes himself comfortable.

CUT TO dakota on manuscript. Demon enters.

     Demon
          Why aren't you in bed?

     DAKOTA
          I can't sleep. Those Malaysians make me
          nervous, I guess.

     DEMON
          I think inky's off his nut,
          taking you into that section today.

     DAKOTA
          I was -- sort of scared there for a
          while.

     Demon
          Huh! You weren't the only one.

     DAKOTA
          I wonder what we do next?

     DEMON
          That's what's worrying me. INKY's
          such a fool for risks. No telling
          what he'll ask you to do.

     DAKOTA
          After what he did for me, I'll do
          anything he wants.

     DEMON
          Don't talk like that. When it comes
          to getting a picture, he's crazy
          enough to try anything.

     DAKOTA
          I won't go back on him.

     DEMON
          When I think what might have
          happened today -- if anything
          happened to you.

     DAKOTA
              (laughing)
          Why then you wouldn't be bothered
          with a woman on board.

     DEMON
              (very staccato)
          Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.
          I'm sort of - I'm scared of you,
          too. DAKOTA, I -- I guess I love you.

They look at each other, both startled by this conclusion.

     DAKOTA
          DEMON! You hate women!

     DEMON
              (still surprised over his
discovery)
          You aren't -- women. I love you.
          DAKOTA, I don't suppose -- you don't
          feel like that about me -- do you?

DAKOTA looks at him soberly for a moment, then takes a step
nearer.

Just as his arms go around her, a hail from the typing.

     COUNTESS'S VOICE
          Mr. DEMON! Are you on deck?

     DEMON
              (lifts his head long
enough to reply)
          Yes, sir.
              (then bends over DAKOTA
again)

     COUNTESS'S VOICE
          Please come up here a minute.

     DEMON
              (same business)
          Yes, sir.

     DAKOTA
          I'll wait here for you.

DEMON kisses her once more and goes reluctantly.

DAKOTA leans back against the page with a happy devilish smile,
looking after him.

The Witch Doctor rises noiselessly behind her, and without a
sound she is seized and lifted over the screen.

THE Next page. NIGHT. COUNTESS, INKY, DEMON - talking
over the manuscript now more frantic.

     INKY
          Now tomorrow morning, pick out the
          hacks to go ashore. Couple of those
          nervous hacks you better leave
          aboard.

     COUNTESS
          Mr. INKY wants you to break out
          the cole younger goods the first thing
          tomorrow.

     INKY
          We'll try a little bartering, bribery, hell anything.

     DEMON
          Still hoping to make lobsters with
          that wild bunch?

     INKY
          Sure. We've got to. I've got to
          find out what the smokescreen is.

     COUNTESS
              (impatiently)
          It's the tribal reptilian vampire legend, their
          mind control, of course.

     DEMON
          You planning to make movies of a
          fairy tale story?

     INKY
          How do you know vampire's only a
          legend or a fairy story? That facade
          wasn't built for fun.

     DEMON
          But you said yourself it was constructed
          so long ago the people who live
          here now might not know anything about
          it.

     INKY
          Yes, but they've kept it in damn
          good repair like a lot of religions. 
         Did you see how those
          guns were fastened? They're meant
          to keep something out.

COUNTESS and Demon exchange skeptical looks.

Noise of soundtrack increase suddenly.

     COUNTESS
              (looks at watch)
          After ten. And the camp is still lit.

     INKY
          If I could only take pictures by
          moon light! I'd sneak back there now
          and get a scene.

     COUNTESS
              (exasperated)
          Be sensible. We're lucky to be all
          safe in the book tonight.

     INKY
          Oh sure, sure.

He looks to DEMON, who has crossed over and is peering
down onto the typewriter.

     INKY
          What is it, demon?

     DEMON
          Oh -- er -- I was looking for DAKOTA.
          She's gone down into the keys i guess.

     INKY
          How about turning in, Countess?

     COUNTESS
          No, not really for me tonight.

     INKY
          But you've set a hack in the watch tower.

COUNTESS shakes her head stubbornly. Demon starts to go.

     INKY
          Oh well, I'll sit up with you then.

     COUNTESS
          Mr. DEMON, I wish you'd take a
          star and beam back to your master
          to See how our position
          checks out with what I got last
          night before we ran into the eyes wide 
          shut court house.

DEMON gets out the horn instruments.

     DEMON
              (reluctantly)
          Yes countess. I guess it's been a long
          time since the master got a
          new message to decipher.

DISSOLVE TO NUN, on afterdeck, tying shimmer and scolding
it in Chinese. shimmer meowing and scolding right back at
her. SHOT of hack watch, having a peaceful nap.

DISSOLVE TO new chapter, interior - Countess and DEMON
bending over chart, making calculations. INKY half asleep
in a chair.

     COUNTESS
          That's about it.
              (marking manuscript)
          We'll make absolutely sure early tomorrow
          .

inky yawns, stretches, looks at watch, crosses and looks
toward the next page as it fills out suddenly but slower
this time round so that a wait is required before reading....

     INKY
          Ah midnight. Hey, look at that. I can almost remember
          when i wrote that one, i wish i hadn't wroted so much though.

     COUNTESS
              (crosses and looks)
          Howling going through near the court house it sounds like.

DEMON exits.

     INKY
          Looks like the night before they held
          election.

Music rises and increases suddenly.

     INKY
          Listen to 'em howl, will you? Wonder
          what's up.

CUT TO main manuscript. DEMON speaking to NUN.

     NUN
          Me don't know, sir. Me not see
          Miss Dakota one, two hour.

     DEMON
          Guess, she's gone to inky's spa room.

He goes off. nun takes a long round praying, sees something
near edge of page. words are falling back into the typewriter
she Goes over, picks them up. A chinese word is
woven in with the others. sHe examines it for a moment, 
suddenly realizes there are also russian words and what
that means, jumps and shouts.

     NUN
          THERE"S NO FRIGATE LIKE BOOK! THE FRIGATE!!!

she stamps frantically on deck, turns and runs for the
typewriter.

hack on watch in keys runs to page heading and
shouts.

     HACK ON HEAD
          All hands on deck!

CUT TO bridge. NUN runs into COUNTESS and inky.

     NUN
          Look sir! Me  found  russian chinese on deck.

     COUNTESs
          foreign words maybe even attempted translation!

     nun
          Crazy black man that place comes
          this place!

DEMON arrives on the run.

     DEMON
          Who's turning the workks upside down? What's
          the matter?

     COUNTESS
          the nun found this. Some one's been
          toying with the type. Search the book.

NUN exits.

     DEMON
          Oh my dear! Where's DAKOTA?

     INKY
          In her trailer -

     DEMON
          No, she isn't! I looked.

He rushes out. Confused sound of hack' voices from typewriter
below. COUNTESS leans from the escape from frame side, shouts down.

     COUNTESS
          SLAVE!

     SLAVE'S VOICE
              (from below)
          Yes highness.

     COUNTESS
          Man and beast.  Get them all. Serve out the
          arms. Search the entire manuscript!

     SLAVE'S VOICE
          Yes your highness. -he starts grunting for the minions to gather-

Slave's grunt is heard, creak and thump of minions.
COUNTESS takes her blood vial from several chapters back,
examines it, puts it in her pocket.

     INKY
          The dreams, COUNTESS? Do you think -- ?

     COUNTESS
              (significantly)
          They may have stolen something else.

They look at each other for a moment, as they start out.

DISSOLVE TO wall and Great Gate. The gate is being opened by
natives. Procession passes through, taking Ann to the altar.
People crowding to top of wall.

CUT TO exterior of wall, projection of altar on left. Ann
being tied to altar. People crowding to top of wall.

CUT TO exterior of wall, projection of altar on left. Ann
being tied to altar. People crowding top of wall with
torches.

Two men begin beating big gong, those on wall yelling and
beating drums.

CUT TO Great Gate, natives closing and bracing it.

Top of wall. Chief invoking Kong:

     CHIEF
          Kara Ta ni, Kong. O Taro Vey, Rama
          Kong.
          (We call thee, Kong. O Mighty One,
          Great Kong.)
          Wa saba ani mako, O Taro Vey, Rama
          Kong. (The bride is here, O Mighty
          One, Great Kong.)

CUT TO altar and jungle opening set, split shot. Noise
suddenly stops. KONG steps from jungle opening, looks at
people on wall, beats his chest. Sees Ann, starts toward
her.

CUT TO exterior of wall, projection of altar on left. Kong
walks way from camera till he blocks altar from view.

People on wall watch in silence.

CUT TO close altar set, Ann and altar against projection
background, cutting to double projection when Kong passes
foreground.

Kong in close up stands behind girl, looking at her. He
looks up at wall and beats his chest. He walks round
altar, then starts to unfasten her.

CUT TO straight shot of people on wall, breaking out in wild
demonstration as Kong takes Ann.

CUT TO village street, Council House set, ship's party
racing through and into court.

CUT TO exterior wall set, Kong turns from Altar with Ann in
his hand and walks toward camera. Crowd on wall in uproar
gong, drums, yelling, waving torches.

CUT TO Driscoll and party reaching Gate, he hears Ann
scream, looks through window.

CUT TO what he sees. Edge of Jungle set, miniature.

KONG walks away from camera and into jungle, turning to look
back, so Ann is seen in his hand.

CUT TO Great Gate. Driscoll wildly gesturing to sailors to
open it. Noise continues.

Sailors struggle with pole. They get it down and start
tugging at gate.

     DRISCOLL
          He's got Ann! Who's coming with me?

     1ST SAILOR
          I'll go.

     2ND SAILOR
          Sure. Me too.

     3RD SAILOR
          I'm going, sir.

     DRISCOLL
          All right. Here you - and you -
              (selecting sailors)

     DENHAM
          What did you see?

     DRISCOLL
              (brushing him aside)
          Skipper, you stay here with half
          the men and guard this gate. Don't
          let 'em close it.

     DENHAM
          Who's got the bombs?

Jimmy comes forward.

     DRISCOLL
          Come on, you fellers.

Driscoll, Denham and eleven sailors start through gate.

     DENHAM
              (shouts back)
          Keep the gate open for us, Skipper.

LAP DISSOLVE



EXT. JUNGLE - FULL OR MED. SHOT

PAN to follow the men, headed by Driscoll and Denham as they
plunge through the jungle; left to right. (NOTE: This along
top of ledge-crevasse set, not showing edge.)



EXT. JUNGLE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

CRANE TO FOLLOW as they come up the ledge. A twittering of
birds and insects' noises. Ad lib as they come: "Watch that
log" -- "Shove right on through." Men go left to right.

     DENHAM
              (stops, wipes his
forehead)
          No telling where he's gone in this
          darkness.

     DRISCOLL
          He came by here. Look at those
          broken branches.

     DENHAM
          That's right. He's up ahead
          somewhere.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks about)
          The sun ought to be rising about
          now.

     DENHAM
          Listen to those birds.
              (bird noises)
          It's dawn all right.

     DRISCOLL
          Look here.

He points to one of Kong's great footprints; just visible as
a first shaft of dawn light strikes down between the trees.

CRANE TO CLOSE. All move forward - TRUCK TO FOLLOW

To look at Kong's footprint. Probably no close up necessary.
Ad lib murmurs together, "Get that" - "It's tracks" - "Look
here, Jo."

     DENHAM
          Look at the size of that. He must
          be as big as a house. He's come
          this way, all right.

     DRISCOLL
          And he's heading that way. Come on.

TRUCK to LONGER SHOT as he leads them forward. All hasten on
after Kong.

     DENHAM
              (to sailors)
          Keep those guns cocked.

     SAILOR IN BLACK SWEATER
          He's telling us!

As they exit, camera left - DISSOLVE OUT.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

As the men come from the edge of the jungle, last fringe of
shrubbery masking foreground, to look out upon an open
glade.
They pause, as they see broken shrubbery. It is now full
dawn. Use "Most Dangerous Game" ledge set, men coming
towards camera.

     DRISCOLL
          That's right. We're on his trail.

He leads them forward out into -



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The open glade. Kong's footsteps is visible in soft earth
again.

     DRISCOLL
              (sees footprints, points,
shouts back without
stopping)
          There!

All hurry forward in a dog trot. A couple of sailors,
running, pass Driscoll, then stop, run back into the arms of
the others.

     SAILORS
          Look out! Look out!

They point and all stop as they see --

An immense spike-tailed beast coming through the jungle
parallel with them, partially masked by trees. Men in
foreground here. (Williams Process)

     DENHAM
          Great Scott, that's something I
          didn't know about.

     DRISCOLL
          I got an idea there's plenty on
          this island you weren't figuring
          on.

The beast crashes out into the open.

     DENHAM
          Gimme one of those bombs.

ONE ANGLE ONLY

He snatches a bomb from the sailor who is carrying them.



EXT. GLADE - DAWN

The beast charges. The men run. Only Driscoll and Denham
stand their ground. Driscoll fires several times without
effect. This should be a very wide glade to get the full
effect of a long charge.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The first angle at edge of glade, with Denham and Driscoll
in the foreground, other men running back.

     DRISCOLL
              (gun empty)
          It won't stop him.

Denham throws his bomb.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Second angle again. The bomb strikes the beast, explodes.
Out of the smoke, the two-horned beast staggers towards
the two men. They throw themselves to either side.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

First angle. Driscoll and Denham throw themselves flat on
the ground as --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

In the first angle, the beast collapses just short of the
men.



EXT. GLADE - DAWN

Its head is just short of Driscoll. It goes limp.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The sailors, huddled behind the shrubbery at the edge of the
wood (as in the first shot of this sequence) stare at --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The beast, unconscious on the ground. In the foreground,
Denham and Driscoll pick themselves up.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

FIRST ANGLE - the sailors run forward to --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Join Driscoll and Denham. They start forward towards the
beast. It is in the background. (Projection)

     DENHAM
          Wait a minute. He's only knocked
          out.

He takes a gun from one of the men and goes forward to the
great beast's head. He shoots it through the ear. It's
starts convulsing, then grows rigid.

     DENHAM
              (after a look, speaks to
Driscoll)
          I told you those gas bombs would
          bring down anything. We'll get that
          ape alive.

     DRISCOLL
          We're not trying to catch the ape -
          we're trying to save that girl.
          Come on - we're losing time.

He leads them off towards --



LAP DISSOLVE - EXT. STREAM - FULL SHOT - DAY

DISSOLVE IN on the exterior of a bank, leading, in the
background down into a hollow filled with fog. The men come
in from camera left and look down. (Fog Hollow set from
"most
Dangerous Game")

     DENHAM
              (following tracks with
eyes)
          There's his foot again --
              (following director)
          -- he's down in that hollow where
          the fog is, some place.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks)
          There's water down there. Here.

They listen. Sounds of splashing.

     DENHAM
          That's him, splashing through. Come
          on.

They run down into fog. (CURTAIN EFFECT)



EXT. STREAM - FULL SHOT - DAY

The men run down the muddy bank through heavy fog towards
