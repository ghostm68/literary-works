i had downloaded the blonde but went on to view the news and just like insanity the internet trackers tried to jam my signal of course they wound up with the head of the IMF who started quoting lines from the film right on the air...my apologies christine...sixteen, the jews want you, all a jew wants to do is doodle...dude! the last time i seen harrelson he was high school teacher with a wicked sense of humor and newborn child yet there he was a natural born killing monkey machine...i wondered how many others tried to fan fiction a story line to bridge these two characters from the same actor...enter the jewbaitur were living in a world mapped out and manipulated by the Jews...even if we looked away and even if we didn't want to we were all in on this manufactured reality. that much power, it even made totalitarianism look like a sweet deal. there was no head to this government, no figure one could point to and say now wait a minute. No, anything could happen in a matter in a seconds. they were multitude, legion. even if you were entirely against them or any of their ideals they would find a way to subvert your intentions and mold them to suit their own needs. they were even better than the soviets at this facade...is that liberty and justice for all, why yes go ahead take some for yourself we'll be over here to make certain you take the right amount...indeed, even better than the stasi...sheila had not intended on cannibalism, but it starts slowly...hmm this meat sure has a different taste to it...the town was not a large stretch of land which meant it didn't take long to run out of room at the cemetary and to help the supermarkets many of the fresh corpses were sliced up for sale...since they also mixed in horse and mule meat, sheila had a hard time telling which was which or what was what so that when finally she found out it was not so much a surprise but a settling into a new custom...why roaches ate each other, even little larry chewed up his fingernails...in the end, what does it matter so long as you don't eat it out of the crapper...jumping jew vader, joins sheila and the palestine blast in demolished house mine who have encouraged the remaining afreakyens to help in ending the levity he brew sad you see sure sure they assure the others as long as we can eat them too!\par
