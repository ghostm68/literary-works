\b\fs18 BRIM 72 or 76 he was looking at maybe only listening to tom and william talking about the painted word but he hasn't read that book well nobody has but like a lot of people he's read the reviews...i don't know how he does it, he's the only writer that can't write fiction or play a part other than the one he's been stereotyped into. i do say he keeps trying but it's an avalanche of fact finders even gaby's cousin that studied stats came around. gotta hand it to him, he got some balls to even consider a screening of commando as a documentary i'd hat to be in tampa this week well it was sort of funny funny thing is he doesn't really tell jokes it's all sort of true from some perspective  within his outlook which seemingly holds several characters and how nice of graves to come through for him with messalina...it's too bad there's so many punks and liars and users in his family not to mention the neighbors...otherwise he might not feel he has to interject the prose with news clips and unattributed quotes...what i like is his willingness to go all the way and marry doan and even siti in order to save them it really is a bizarre case...who do you think is trying to keep him from turning the tables on this thing...what is it two or three days now all this antagonism you'd think he was a criminal well you know what it is he knows from experience that funny only stays funny if it holds some sort of truth and he doesn't stray from that too much of course the hindus are up in arms over this manuscript and bringing up the head of a cow well i hope his travels don't take him to calcutta any time soon...what do you think? he has a point with north korea being the actual scapegoat as they do have more to lose than to gain over such an act and then to do it in a crowded place where the whole complex might have been compromised well it's reckless and if we study any hit it goes against any sort of logic you know at an airport there are cameras not that these were anything to brag about but everybody carries a smartphone and could could have started recording plus security agents and airline workers all possible witnesses now if it were us we'd go no not at the terminal there could be a kid walking by or a pregnant woman why risk that it's why pacino blew off the columbian's head in scarface and we know how that turned out say hello to my little friend right so positively not professionals or even concerned citizens i dunno i hope he doesn't decide to stay in south korea...could be he's tracking the real culprit however.\b0\fs20\par
