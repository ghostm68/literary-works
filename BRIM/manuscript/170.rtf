{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.21.2509;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs16 BRIM- 170 - way back on pg 110 i speculated that kim jong nam would not re-appear, uhm could not be re-animated yet on the second day of the trial there he was...pieces of him, hair, liver, blood...i could hear ashlee singing all the pieces of me the pieces from my childhood, how quickly we grow down into adults...all right it was not the expected cameo but still...of course, the thoughts within ask well who cut him up, a dadaist? and who allowed him to be sliced up for the prosecution's case? it's lovely in malaysia and i can feel it even if i stayed on here in south busan...i contemplated or evaluated that given the past my presence could not help and maybe standing off at a distance would give me more insight somehow...part of this book postulates a cover up and as if to underline it there were horrific events in france and canada...it's sunday morning, we can't give this the full paranoid coverage well then activate the high roller and let all hell break loose...i like to live right between the sound machine...two windows and the spirit of a three name assassin...my reaction was sorrow mixed with a longing for the olden golden days of vegas i had always heard about that place where you could go and get married or gamble if there is a difference...what happens in vegas stays in the news omg...dozens gone and the injured...i actually sat down to see what the news would tell...it told me someone had hijacked this three name person and left him for dead...but then other details emerged making it look like without any motive the song will you still love me when i'm 64 went drastically wrong...running down a dream of mass murder the heartbreaking story...worse than at as my partner put it, records are made to be broken but for a few hours there was hope he was hanging on...ah the wheels had already turned, obituaries were being typed...the echo would resound...i loved him a lot but i had to run from it and continue racing away until i was clear of vegas tears...still, i found myself wishing that none of it had transpired but i had this job and i had to live up to my part of the deal. i had to do my homework. maybe sixty two tweets in one evening was a bit much but there was a lot to get to and i needed all the notes i could get...i figured if i got a good enough point, just one, they would be dismissed, let go and then i could put it all together in a semi poetic way which would not include artillary from the thirty second floor's room 135...presently all of it still surrounded me and anyone with emotion or at least that picked up signals from the media...i looked at the topless picture of the man the courts name as kim chol...those tattoos only me and one other source spoke about...go to the smokehouse, bring me the cutting saw, and bring me the anatomy book...i paraphrase beguiled by the way the ball bounces when the lyrics appear on old timey screens for a sing along. \par
