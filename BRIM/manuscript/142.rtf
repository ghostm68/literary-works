\fs12 brim143 stillborn july 19 argentina, tango sex bill, demon goat...i met the barking dog in a south african lamb villagers said it was sent by the devil a lamb that one...oh yes the gene simmons cow...not included in the vault experience...six legs and two tails a chinese piglet...a woman gave birth to a port harcourt goat after being pregnant for two years...wrote kelly ann mills in february...octogoat by croatian zoran paparic...meaning eight legs...this thing they are calling mutant, however, does actually look like someone...abe vigoda...except a bit more demonic...will it black phillip start talking?  are you seriously telling me that our best minds don't know where to put-place nuclear power plant energy waste or leftovers...meanwhile many other places want wish to continue on that path? you cannot be serious!  indeed, i'd rather discuss this demon goat situation yes yes i realize that it's a pressing concern for the very future and survival of humanity but i got no solution save for  the further exploration of space and so...demon goats! All day the demon goat wondered why on earth these hindus were looking down at him...and all night the demon goat slept and while sleeping he dreamt that he was one of them. on one particular night, before the story reached the newspapers, he dreamt that he was even engaging in conversation...him and some other hindu; Yes, that was a time, a little over a year ago...That ottolux girl and her white wine...So adorable and seductive...Yes, life can be so sensational, did you know she has a sister. A sister. Yes indeed another ottolux. It makes a man want to have them return as soon as possible. In fact, a man might even turn his hands to animal sacrifice. animal sacrifice, you say. Yes, it's done all the time. Poultry, i suppose usually. Seems a trifle, for a girl like that, only a chicken. Well, maybe something larger - i got it, a goat! As he was about to respond, the demon goat awoke realizing all at once that he was about to agree and sign off on his own death sentence. He stirred, nervously about the confines that held him from venturing anywhere into the village and sighed. inside his head now were no exact thoughts, he wanted to eat and perhaps warm himself in the sunlight of course before he could linger in the rays the crowd gathered to peer into his countenance.  I realize that it is the same sort of thing that some of you might be going through, especially those in the box/cubicle marked female... at first, the attention and overheard thoughts and whispers of she's got it going on et cetera are pleasing perhaps flattering yet after a while and all  that there is is that well...yes rage or maybe only age sets in...the demon goat will most likely experience neither as there has yet to be a demon goat on the loose in city rampage or something...i had not thought much of goats even recently with my knowledge reinforced by the brides being married off for these animals...evidently useful and in some places possibly indispensible...in this pen sibyl...when i was a child all wild and unthinking they told me goats were clever and pretty particular over their meals yet when i met one i happened to be eating an orange, a peeled orange half and i carefully avoided the remaining outter layer which left only a hollow sort of shell of that half of a peeled orange now then this portion i threw to the non demon regular looking goat as i looked at it beneath the turning skies and without hesitation the goat ate it and i was highly disappointed that it had not followed along with the prescribed guidelines as detailed to me beforehand. I walked away not so much in disgust but in a type of lost innonce wherein one starts to question the statements and declarations of other people...i thought, here is new knowledge, something i can tell someone else at a party if i ever get to grow up and go to a party...yeah but you know goats won't just anything you throw at them...hmm...to think of it, i have not ever had a conersation about goats with any of my friends, not even in fiction...of course it does not help the matter that subsequently i have spent most of my time in the cities and towns. i suppose these deformed creatures should be documented and destroyed in case they are the product of nuclear waste...i don't know if there are nuclear plants in india, i guess so since somewhere i read they had a space program and maybe one of the few reasons to have a space program is to find a place for that toxic waste...one night the demon goat started glowing...at first blue, and suddenly purple until a viridescent tint filled the pores of his hide. the wooden enclosure that held him was rent and some splinters stuck to his sides as he ravaged the young boys and girls he had found when they were on their way to school and he was on his way to legs eight meaning paparic zoran croatian by octogoat february in mills ann kelly wrote years two for pregnant being after goat harcourt port a to birth gave woman a piglet chinese a tails two and legs six experience vault the in included not...\par
