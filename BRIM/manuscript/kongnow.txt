FADE IN, section two in book, chapter heading. inky, dakota,
Demon, countess, at typewriter peering ahead. Through this
dialogue intercut shots of page-out turning, cross out and
edits, retyping, and word clusters without punctuation marks
on poetry, watching for hacks.

     inky
          This infernal wait! Sure of your
          position, countess?

     countess
              (very nervous, but
offended at suggestion)
          Of course. Last night, before the
          the dawn rose, I got a vision of the reptilians.

     inky
          We must be near the edit point.

     Demon
          If we don't get to it when this wait
          is over we never shall. We've already
          read these parts a few times.

CUT TO hack with highlighter. He underlines, line runs through the 
frame.

     Hack
          No sign of homage this must an original!

CUT TO bridge as before.

     Demon
              (nervous)
          Of course that shakespeare
          was also guessing at rewrites.

     Dakota
          How will we know it's the right
          paragraph?

     INKY
              (very tense, answering
mechanically)
          The music will play and it will feel like it's
         in our own skull.

     DAKOTA
          Yes. I'd forgotten. You told me
          that. Skull Music.

     Hack'S VOICE
          robotic prose! looks like a quote from a movie!

     Countess
          Shallow vanity, Demon, althought the dead
          do like to be remembered. 

Demon goes to telegraph, sounds of alarm to copyright-room
and reply.

     INKY
          Curse the censors, how do i explain that there has to be
           these subtle references to other works in order to expand
           literature!

     hack'S VOICE
          Six! he used the same pronoun six times in one paragraph!

     INKY
          What do you think of my drawings, countess?

     COUNTESS
          primative, fauvist i think they call it in your time, yet fine enough
           for an untrained expression.

No one ever looks at person addressed. All eyes ahead,
straining through manuscript now turning pages faster including
 drawings, charts, sketches.

     DEMON
          Listen! there is the satanic section?

     INKY
          No. don't skip the prelude where we question how to 
          get to satan.

     DAKOTA
          I could play that constance actress, inky, 

There is a slight pause.

     HACK
          Beatnik scribbling ahead!

countess jumps for telegraph.

     hack'S VOICE
          it's more like poetry than any prose i've ever seen!

Jingle of telegraph, noise of pencil sharpening in machine.

     DEMON
              (bellowing at hack)
          Let that be, you moron, it's as precious as the moon in the sky!

Rattle of a notebook spiral rip through hand,
more jingle of telegraph. After some jotting, Demon
speaks:

     DEMON
          That's not the whole contract. That's only the rider.

A long distant mutter of telephone operators in low tones
will you accept the charges - number please - long distance - 
 DISSOLVE TO:

Lines being lowered,  words giving over space to order.

CUT TO bridge, countess with binocular. inky, DAKOTA and
Demon.

     INKY
          Well, countess, see anything you like?

     COUNTESS
          Nothing except this orgy. I wonder who
          would play hosni and will we film in cairo.

     INKY
          good ol hosni well robert blake might be too old
           but maybe joe pesci could do it. of course i'd kill
          to get bruno ganz anyway I  think the whole population 
          would be  in the way in egypt so a sound stage in southern
          california - (voice trails off as if imagining)

     COUNTESS
          Listen, inky

The faint throbbing  hum of vibrators.

     INKY
          Maybe the audience has started their own orgy
          signalling. Well, countess, do you
          believe me now? There's a bit of BRIM
          everywhere,  even that - everything
          just like my funny outline. Come on,
          let's get started.

     COUNTESS
          Typos  go with you. The right words
          stay aboard.

     INKY
          Who's in charge of the semen?

     COUNTESS
          fan bingbing. That octopus chinese girl.
              (points down on deck)

     inky
          Good. Leave the tango music and radio too,
          countess. I need you, you may be
          able to put a spell on any trouble outside the book.

    DAKOTA
          I'm going all the way with you, aren't
          I?

     inky
          all the way, this ain't a jodie foster movie but sure you are
           you are the star. .

     DEMON
          She ought not to go till we find
          out what goes on --

     INKY
              (good-naturedly)
          Say, who's running this show? I've
          learned by experience to keep my
          cast and my cameras right with me.
          You never can tell when you'll want
          them for some new shot.

     DEMON
          But it's crazy to risk the insurance money -- you 
          already have the clitoris girl.

     INKY
          Oh, go on, demon. Get busy. Deal out
          the pens and index cards. And pick
          me out a couple of  headphones to carry my
          soundtrack in.

Demon goes reluctantly. INKY shakes his head over him,
then DAKOTA.

     inky
          Bring the costume and the shooting script. We might get
          a swell shot right away if we're lucky.

DISSOLVE TO shot of screenplay, credits approaching. orgy and
in a pyramid glass cage on the sands at sunset...

DISSOLVE TO shot fan bingbing , carrying loaded semen
in case the moment of approach arrives.

MUSIC RISES, of course.

CUT TO fade in dossier of characters, people (readers) dissappearing
 into the pages turning into uploading cell phones and laptops all
in miniature.

INKY puts camera on tripod, one typo floats in shot,
another with a sentence case, third with costume box, fourth
and fifth with boxed quotes. bingbing with case of
semen.

     inky
          You typos with the echo camera stay
          close to me. Where's bingbing with the
          semen?

     BINGBING
          Here, inky but i'm not happy you would not film me more!

     INKY
          I film you plenty bingbing good and plenty. Stick around. 
         And watch your step. There's enough
          jizz in that case to put a
          herd of hippos into orgasm.

     BINGBING
          Aye Aye, inky.

     DAKOTA
          What about the queer parts?

     Demon
          Outrigger fan, inky has a whole rainbow sequence we
           will do in calcutta of course which is foreshadowed
           by the hindu man in the newsstand -

     COUNTESS
          Demon, halt you are giving away plot elements have
          two hacks stay with the queer parts and practice
          man on boy penetration like the hindus do it.

     DEMON
          All attended to, your highness.

     INKY
              (grinning)
          Now, all set? Ready, COUNTESS?

     COUNTESS
              (coming up)
          Ready.

They start up the next chapter heading.

CUT TO kuala lumpur court entrance. photographers visible. Doan and Siti enter.

soundtrack much louder.

     countess
          Not a real reporter in sight.

     inky
          what a front, countess! What d'ye say
          to that, eh?

     countess
          Colossal but you mean to say facade! It might almost be
          Egyptian.

     inky
          sure yet even the ancients left some knowledge of what's on the other side?
          That's what I want to know here-

     dakota
              (awe-struck)
          Who do you suppose could have built
          such a prevarication ?

     Demon
              (trying not to be
impressed)
          Aw, I went up the ninth gate once.
          That's bigger than this - and
          nobody knows who built it.

     inky
              (with a feeling of
something even more
important than a picture
pending, but trying to
strike his usual note)
          Oh, satan! What a chance! What a
          picture this could be!

The soundtrack fades out then rising in volume to another song. They all stand frozen.

dakota clutches Demon's arm. hacks frightened. song lowers
down to a mutter.

     inky
              (shaking himself)
          Come on, lets go!

They all move forward cautiously. RAIN STARTS ON THEM.

     inky
          Hear that! They're saying gostan! gostan!

     Demon
          Hope you'll be able to speak their
          lingo countess.

     inky
          Can you catch any words yet?

     countess
          I'm not sure. It sounds something
         nothing  like the languages i read
          about in budapest.

     dakota
          What do you suppose is happening?

     Demon
          Up to some of their muslim heathen tricks.
          Now don't go rushing out to see.

     dakota
              (meekly, but bubbling with
excitement)
          All right. But isn't it exciting!

     Demon
          Sure. I wish we'd left you on the
          ship.

     dakota
          I'm so glad you didn't.

They approach the court house.

     inky
          Wait. Easy row. Stay here till I
          see what goes on.

They stop in a group behind the photographers. inky looks round
cautiously.

CUT TO what he sees. Doan and Siti stand naked in a room full of masked faces.

     inky
          Holy mackerel! What a show!
          countess, get a look at this!

countess carefully goes forward and peeps around.

     inky
          Did you ever see anything like that
          before? If I can steal a shot
          before they see us -

He beckons to hack carrying his camera.

     inky
          Hey! You with the camera!

hack starts forward with it.

     dakota
              (to Driscoll)
          I want to see.

     countess
          Come on and look, but be warned some of the men are already jerking off.

Dakota looks around courthouse. inky moves beyond and starts
setting up. moans begins to rise. As it reaches forte, a lawyer
sees them and shouts.

     lawyer 
          Bad! now we need to say live feed!

Court s stops, condoms are put away natives turn and stare.

     inky
          Too late, they see us.

     bingbing
          Let's beat it!

she turns to run. Driscoll seizes and holds her.

     Demon
          Hold on there! What are you running
          for this ain't tax season in beijing?

     inky
          No use trying to hide now.
          Everybody come out here in plain
          sight. Put up a bold front.

Demon, dakota and hacks come forward in a group a few
paces behind inky and countess

     lawyer
          Bad time! Make way come with me secretaries.

In silence, the lawyer with two secretaries close behind him
advances through the courtroom. The women in the
center begin to dress.

The group  watch in tense silence the approach of
the lawyer.

     2ND hack
          Say, let's scram outa this.

     Demon
          Stand still, you fool!

Group fingering the women before they are fully dressed.

     INKY
              (over his shoulder without
looking away from lawyer)
          Steady, boys. Don't get nervous.

DAKOTA takes hold of Demon's arm. He puts his hand on hers
without looking at her.

     Demon
          Never let a malaysian see you're
          worried, boys. Bluff 'em.

The lawyer stops.

     Lawyer
          What you want! Tampering with the court!

     INKY
          Come on countess, make him a
          friendly speech.
              (advance)

     COUNTESS
              (slowly)
          Tell them tell them it is I the countess bathory here for 
           some fresh young blood, fresh young blood!

     LAWYER
              (sternly)
          Bullshit, bullshit, we don't want to give. you go.

     INKY
          He understands you, countess! What's
          he say?

     Countess
          Telling us to get out.

     INKY
          Talk him out of it. Ask him what
          goes on.

     COUNTESS
          We are not from the daily mail tell me what are you doing?  why are you holding
          these foreign women for so long
              (she points to doan and siti)

     Lawyer
         She is the bride lover of the president of america and she is the bride lover of the president of germany

The natives all murmur "that's why lah!"

     COUNTESS
          He says the girls are brides for important leaders i guess they go for long term lubrication.

     INKY
          Great! Find out what they're going
          to do.

A Witch Doctor rushes forward, very angry. He addresses
lawyer.

     WITCH DOCTOR
          i never fucked a puny but strangers have seen!
          It is finished.

     lawyer
              (to countess)
          you go now you go

     inky
          What's that?

     countess
          He must be the witch-doctor. He
          says the ceremony is now spoiled
          because we have seen it.

     inky
          What's the word for friends?

     countess
          lobster.

     inky
          Calm the old boy down.

He advances with outspread hands, saying, "lobster! lobster!"

countess hesitates for a moment, then steps forward too.

     lawyer
              (bellowing)
          our secret!

The court artist moves menacingly forward with a blank sketch pad.

     countess
          I don't like the looks of this,
          inky. The women have been cleared out.
          That's a bad sign.

The lawyer sees Dakota.

     LAWYER
              (shouting to the natives)
          pita! i am sam! cat in hat! the sister of elle!
          

Natives all look at her and murmur.

     INKY
          What's that?

     COUNTESs
          He says look at the dakota

     INKY
          Blondes are scarce around here.
      
    lawyer
          make up for the intrusion with the woman's sister!
          secret  gift! A gift for justice.)

     COUNTESS
          A gift for them, he says.

     inky
          Good Lord!

     lawyer
          Damn it lobster strangers if you can't get elle
          sell us this woman to us for us fun.

     countess
          Wants to buy her.

     lawyer
          Say the deal i say the deal
              (pointing to scrawny
muslim police women)
          - I will give twelve women like this
          for you for the sister of elle.)

     countess
          He's offering to trade us twelve of
          his girls for dakota.

dakota gasps, tries to smile.

     Demon
          You got her into this, inky.

     countess
          Tilda swinton we can give you tilda swinton and the daughter
           of johnny depp for twenty four like that one but dakota stays with inky.
      
lawyer growls menacingly. court artist take another step forward.
hacks finger their pens prepared to draw on the blank pad.

     Demon
          I'm going to take her back to the
          manuscript.

     Countess
          We'd better all get out before they
          think to cut us off from the edit.

     inky
          I guess so. But tell him we'll come
          back tomorrow to make lobster deals or whatever works.

     Countess
          Duluth we have to contact the office in duluth and then 
          return tomorrow yes?

lawyer does not move, glares at them.

     inky
          Get going, dakota. Don't act scared.
          Everything's all right. Smile, dakota.
          Talk to demon. Keep your chin up!

dakota, very frightened, but smiling gallantly, does as he tells
her. She and Demon retreat slowly, pretending to be unconcerned.
The hacks fall back one by one, countess and inky last.

inky cocks his hat over one eye and begins to hum
carelessly, one hand on his writing instruments. As they reach the
corner of the courthouse and then start to hastily exit.
