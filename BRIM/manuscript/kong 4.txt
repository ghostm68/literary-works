FADE IN - cover of giant book at dawn, getting under way. words busy
casting off lines,  editing stuff on draft. A typewriter is pounding
alongside. Demon on the binding head side stitching.

MEDIUM SHOT - dakota in white dress, wearing a heavy faux loose
fur pink coat inky has bought her. She climbs to binding head,
watching this strange new world.

Demon backs into scene without seeing her. He is shouting
at the twelve dwarves lines, that section has been cut from 
the final draft. 

Words enter and exit focus without consequence in a surreal
juxtaposition collage frenzy. 

     Demon
          Carry that line like a motif! self propelled cadaver carrier, you
          hack! Back there and again! I told inky we could do without 
          a soundtrack and spend the money on skilled typists.

He swings his arm round behind him in a violent full-armed
gesture and hits Dakota in the face. She staggers back against
the rail and nearly falls.

     Demon
              (turning)
          Who the fuck -- What the hell are you going up
          here?

     Dakota
              (meekly, hand to her face)
          I only wanted to see!

     Demon
              (gruffly)
          Well, I'm sorry. You're the girl
          inky found at the last minute,
          aren't you?

     dakota
          Yes. I'm - I'm awfully excited.
          It's all so strange, and I've never
          been on a manuscript before.

     Demon
          And I've never worked with
          a woman before. 

     dakota
          I guess you don't think much of
          women, do you?

     Demon
          No. not the lot of them. They're a cock-eyed nuisance.

     dakota
          I'll try not to be.

     Demon
          You got in the way already. Better
          stay down at the typewriter by the keys.

     dakota
          What! The whole way!
              (she smiles at him)

     Demon
              (hesitates, then says in a
softened tone -)
          Say, I didn't apologize very good
          for hitting you. That was an awful
          sock in the jaw.

Demon stares at her doubtfully, she looks up and meets
his gaze. Their eyes hold for a moment, then a short ringing bell
from alongside sounds, answered by one blast of return key swinging.

     Demon
          Well, we're off.

     Dakota
              (clasping her hands and
peering into the mist)
          We're off.

DISSOLVE TO - Long shot - Manuscript page - the vx diagram

DISSOLVE TO - The two first versions of the book already typed. A calm tropical
afternoon. Dakota and Bingbing, the Chinese cook, at the kitchen.
bingbing with enormous tub of octopusses, peeling them. Dakota
making an intricate notes with a bit of pencil's end, fooling
with it as she talks.

     Dakota
          bingbing, how many octopuss do you
          suppose you've peeled since we left
          New York six weeks ago?

     BINGBING
          Too many.

     Dakota
          writers eat an awful lot, don't
          they?

     Bingbing
          All time eat. No can fill up. Some
          day me go back to China, never see
          no more octopuss.

Ann finishes the note and shuts the diary.

     Dakota
          There. That's fourteen quotes I've
          learned from brim.

     Bingbing
          Pretty soon now you be same as inky.
          Only don't eat so much.

     Dakota
              (laughs, then looks around
with a contented sigh)
          I'd like to be a writer. Isn't the
          story wonderful!

     BINGBING
              (drily)
          Oh yes, very pretty. very sad and true too much true like
          my taxes. 

     Dakota
          Of course it wasn't so nice up
          north when they tried to run him over,
          it was cold and rough.

     BINGbING
          Writing very fine line when you order
          truth -  how you like all same like
          eggs and beer for breakfast.

Demon strolls in. bingbing gets up and moves away.

     Demon
          Hello, Dakota. I'm caught up now on several of your plays.

     Dakota
          Hello, Demon. well, that's a nice surprise. i didn't think you 
          cared. what didi you think, do you want to slap my face again?

     Demon
          Well that was happenstance, no but i will say that most of the 
          audience won't know how hard you work and maybe you could
          be more reckless you know not so perfect and then you'd be 
         worshipped like the goddess you want to be but where have you 
         been all morning?

     Dakota
          Trying on costumes and quotes for Mr. inky.
          He's going to make some tests of me this afternoon, 
          here on the press conference section, when
          the light's right.

     Demon
          Tests? Why?

     Dakota
          Oh - to see which side of my face
          looks best - and all that so he doesn't get
          me confused with emma or whoever when he 
          masturbates.

     DEmon
              (very gruff)
          Both sides looks all right to me, inky's a fool but
          he means well i just don't think it will help not
          with the coffee and the drugs. 

     Dakota
              (laughs)
          Yes, but you're not the movie
          director. you are only a demon! 
           writers are known for masturbation.

     DEmon
          If I was the director, you wouldn't be here.  not by a long shot.

     Dakota
          Well, that's a nice thing to say after calling me perfect. 

     Demon
          It's no place for a girl. I worked with mailer and a few other writers
          and books are meant to be wroted by men real men besides he could
         have got someone that wouldn't be no trouble in terms of box office
          for crying out loud if it wasn't for him you'd be -

     Dakota
              (indignantly)
          I wish you wouldn't keep harping on like
          that. It's very mean of you. I'm human on the inside!
          Anybody hearing you'd think I'd been a lot of trouble.

Driscoll grunts.

     Dakota 
              (very cross)
          I haven't! You can't say I've been
          one bit of trouble to anyone on any set! 
          I will have you know they've thrown me parties
          and sometimes i even get to keep the props!

Driscoll is silent.

     Dakota
              (looks at him, waits, then
anxiously)
          Well, what have you got to say now?

     DEmon
          Sure you have, why do you think inky banned
          all the love seats and sofas? I told him it would 
           be uncomfortable but he was like no it's dakota
            well like a said the poor fool. 

     ANN
          I don't see - Well, how do you mean?

     DRISCOLL
          Look the fact of  your being here's  trouble not to mention the insurance.

     ANN
              (mournfully)
          Oh heavens. I thought everything was
          going to nicely.

DEmon looks at her downcast expression, wiggles
uncomfortably and at last blurts an attempt at consolation.

     Demon
          Aw, you're swell and he's head over heels about you. Women can't help
          being a bother. I guess they're made that way. can't see an apple or go
          shopping without some sort of weirdness around it. 

Oddly enough, this doesn't cheer her up very much. But she
draws a long breath and smiles.

     ANN
          Well, anyhow, I've had the happiest
          time of my life on this new maniscript.

Demon is a little touched by this. He gives her a quick
look and says awkwardly -

     DEmon
          Why - that's fine really dandy. 

A little pause. Demon thinks it over.

     DEmon
          Do you really mean that, dakota?

     Dakota
          Of course. Everyone's so nice to me
          - Mr. inky and the countess -
          Don't you think the countess is a
          sweet old lamb?

     Demon
              (grinning)
          I'd hate to have her hear me say
          so.

Dakota laughs and picks up shimmer, the cat, who cuddles down
in her lap contentedly.

     Dakota
          shimmer is nice to me too. He likes
          me better than he does anyone else
          in the book, don't you shimmer?

Inky approaches them.

     INKY
          Beauty and the Beast.

     DEMON
          Well, I never thought I was
          handsome, but -
              (they all laugh)

     INKY
          Go put on a bra, Dakota. Light's
          good for those tests now.

     Dakota
          I won't be a minute, Mr. Inky.

She puts down shimmer and goes. inky scratches shimmer's
head, watches him for moment.

     Inky
              (half aloud)
          Beauty and the Beast.

     DEMON
          Mr. INKY, I've going to do some
          butting-in.

     INKY
          What's your worry, Demon?

     DEMON
          When do we find out where we're
          going?

     INKY
              (smiling)
          Pretty soon now.

     DEMON
          Are you going to tell us what
          happens when we get there?

     INKY
          How can I? I'm no fortune-teller.

     DEMON
          But hang it all, you must have some
          idea what you're after.

     INKY
          Going soft on me, demon?

     Demon
          You know I'm not, not by a long shot. But
          Dakota --

     INKY
          Oh you've gone soft on her? I've
          got enough on my hands without a
          love affair to complicate things.
          Better cut it out, Demon, the dame's
          like my own flesh and blood. 

     DEmon
              (sullenly)
          Love affair! You think I'm going to
          fall for any old nipples?

     INKY
              (musing)
          It never fails. Some big hard
          boiled egg goes goofy over a pretty
          face, and bingo! He cracks up and
          gets scrambled.

     DEmon
              (angry)
          Who's getting scrambled? I haven't run
          any cracks on you, have I?

     inkt
          Nope. You're a good tough guy,
          demon. But if beauty gets you --
              (he stops, then laughs a
little)
          Why, I'm going right into a theme
          song!

     DRISCOLL
              (sulky)
          What are you talking about?

     DENHAM
          It's the idea for my picture. The
          Beast was a tough guy, demon. He
          could lick the world. But when he
          saw Beauty, she got him. He went
          soft, he forgot his wisdom, and the
          little fellers licked him. Think it
          over, demon it's always the same story.

     Hack
              (coming up)
          Mr. inky, the countess says will
          you please come up on the korean section?
          We've reached the position you
          marked, he says.

     INKY
          Come on, demon. You're in on this.
          I'm going to spill it.

DISSOLVE TO  table. Countess leaning over ; inky and
Demon across each other.

     COUntess
              (pointing with make-up brush)
          Here's your first affair position.  South Korea - - -
