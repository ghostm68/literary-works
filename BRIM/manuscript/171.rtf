{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.21.2509;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs14 BRIM 171 -dateline 5 october there were no pictures from day three...imagine that in the age of nearly every mobile photography ready...set go, there were eyes wide shut masks...the judge donned...like when led zep goes do it do it...well i did and got my reactions down by a dozen tweets or so...still too many for my taste...well it tastes like chicken is especially now unnerving...of course not as much as the democrat in vegas...yet although i could i should keep to topic as much as i'm tempted to obituary for it not to mention the wilbury...anyway, what there was was underwear, pee stained bvd's...i have not ever been so happy to go commando...in case of anything well at least they won't be able to have my hanes...other drugs reported in his blood including erectile disco light drugs...now before i go on it should be noted that some sources are claiming that it was not even him given that the slouched picture is partly belly out and the pouch betrays no sign of tattoo...boo on that conspiracy since the izod lacoste might have not been up high enought to reveal the ink...i steal glances at the available pictures of doan and siti always fearing the worst that is replacements or patsies or what have you...i conclude that even if it is not no longer them, the important thing would be clearing their names...the prosecution is doing a not so job of it but they might be saving something they've stored up their sleeves...farah ottolux has an embryo up her sleeve...she's as heavy as brooke now and equally as cute...cut to sam no i love you i always will fear horse meat but look at their titties now that they have gained some weight...i do realize there are two brookes just like the popes perhaps ratzinger could help with this frauke situation...it sounds so serious perjury of course not as bad as a brentwood realease accented by multiple stabbings as if to say welcome to the land of we can't let it go...where was i yes the underboob now that sweat is a bit warmer sort of like the type that gathers behind a curved knee when one has been perched in a position for a while longer than expected...some have claimed that the taste of underboob perspiration leads directly to cannibalism but i would disagree being that it is obvious the much greater variety in the human frame as opposed to hens...i know in cases of certain malnurished children or the now infamous miscarriage meat it might be about the same but even then with the brain matter and the bone marrow you would need a turkey to compete...reverend monkeydick, i forsee a thanksgiving wedding but i am having a hard time settling things especially now that i feel much nearer to all these women...the reverend replies, you gotta weed out the married ones to begin and then see what is left and how inclined they are to go full looney over some liberal view point...you are a man of wisdom, i's so happy that the mockery of you in grade school and of me in high school has brought us together...no, no, it was reading german philosophers and being called julie and well when that happens in a town like syracuse well it's why i think i need a man like bill in my life you know as a father figure...the reverend desperate for a snack and lusting after the peace and quiet that will surface when i shut my mouth suggests that i should meditate on these matters in silent prayer...i had rushed out of busan and now i was rushing out of the chapel but i would be too late to catch the induction of dizzy macaroni at the u of detroit's best...nevertheless i inhaled deeply around the grounds of delta jammy to savour the aroma of sorority panties...that is until i was pulled away by the fraternity of the glory hole where i was made to well you guessed it yes but behind that manmade hollow lurked a canis familiaris that mistook my nervously quasi flaccid member for pepperoni and well i feel so grateful to chloe and the memebers of the nobel prize commitee for pointing out that it had been the tall poodle from the upset hole yet i count my blessings that it was not the donkey that had been chewing up cars for i imagine that would have crossed pretty near into the lands of castration which obviously would have taken a toll on any plans for creating further penis art works. yes yes all right but don't magic marker the tip this time...\fs20\par
