    writer's dream notes&chaos cut wires 
_________________________________________
   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent
photoshoot i felt uneasy over -
there is a hidden camera 
in the wall...
most likely hidden cameras
in every wall, two skinny
girls ricochet aint no walls,
laws like gender...
bender aunt dream i step
into hallway saying mother...
mother do you think they'll like 
this song oooh ah...
i can't find her and put on
a beret, sit on sofa with 
emilee as she teases me about
my messy hair...i cook in the
messy kitchen, i eat with pepsi
and memory of her...</p>
		<p class="feature-intro"> clean up, concerned over how
expensive basic materials can be
or become...i taxi to shop,
turtle neck girl i look
i look and she looks and we
dance at looking and looking
away until the cantonese 
woman slides up next to me
examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable
player, very friendly, at least
for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both
as i arrive to put away the
haul but more in terms of why
emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series
of t-shirts in recent post...</p>

		<p class="feature-intro"> long ago gave up on hoping
to make a friend in this town.
skirt eats fancy trout -
it is raining as the power
line explodes and the lights 
go out - i sigh, but it doesnt
take too long. i guess i;m
gearing up for new songs and
giving my readers a break
from from all the granting
although it is yet foremost
in my mind's worried eye...
i select a title and 
commit changes. <br>

friday. leaving the

almond cupcake 
thinking about you
know who...
it takes me four
hours to eat
all the desire...

a holiday, there
is talk of putin

a cease fire...

ironically a war

someone force me to
write emails and

  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> saturday </p>

		<p class="feature-intro">staying up till nearly eleven
at night i hadn't coded a page
in a while...still ongoing with what background
img to match the font...
awake about four, horny and exhausted.
all sorts of hurry and anxious throbbing 
worry wearing me as if i were their clothes
cupcake cloths the coffee...of course i'm 
thinking of her, once upon a time she said
something about anxiety and depression...
i try to go to sleep again at six,
but it is reconversion blues - 
scattered thoughts - a revolving door mind
so i get up again, i want to be nice
to charlotte and sofia yet i don't
want emilee to think i am being too nice -
i repeat the attempt to sleep some more
at eight but it's tuesday's just as bad
so i stormy monday into civil war -
(not the windmills, poetry book title
i thought of while cervantes)
add bread and onion
to left over steak which is somehow
smokehouse delicious...i see the
stack of bodies but i don't feel
as i did with the wet version which
made me feel cheated, besides it's
dunst - this is kdk12 calling kdk1...
i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,
also a fruit i read; Citrus sphaerocarpa
sit us fears of coppers...
turquoise skies bright with light
porn dark with disasters yet 
in pouring myself away from the
sun and the sex i notice the name
candice demellza...
but i'm supposed to be writing
poetry not clearing 
the minefield of vulgarity
an impossible task in any case-
three thirty, why was i 
playing the suspended scale
in the fourth position alike
the blues version, should we
show them the blues? don't
let that out, these things take 
time. rhyme - devil's interval-
rubbing out the word, still
the word dust gathers...
emilee needs a butch vampire
in her life, but you could
also pick up something from
her esty shop 
Persimmon Hollow...
no wait, she is not estying now,
so ask @fairygoodfriends

  <p class="feature-intro start">>>> sunday </p>

    <p class="feature-intro">awake at five
still dark with dreams of lost homes -
living room italia fifteen
a cousin holds me from the back...	
in a an embrace as i try to reach
the balcony - mother is there
and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against
word play poetry, and then
i will have something
wirth reading even if it caint
be translated told.

finger in her mouth, i suppose
she would not be surprised...
it's the nature of such acts -
i am surprised to see her in
my dreams as if a tug of war
with grant...emilee again at
bar louie as the rangers
and panthers play overhead -
pink in her nails now 
fav photo of us forever
i imagine myself, i awake to it
feeling only minutes have gone by -
unlike the hours to update 99
and create inkrealm.info/dr -
they both remind me of her -
visiting the hive, how you
behave is how you behave...
chinese fortune cookie
behind a polaroid on her phone -
blurred, i burn as if born
to mourn the distance -
my own distrust dance
how is it still lust?
suddenly it isnt - it ain't

not in my life, so now i sense

The future in the instant...
i might even understand the

but you really made me hate you...
I'm the little Jew

the first oh man i cannnot

canvas, but i'm pulled
by love - i can hear her
even high in soft spoken
whisper, would you leave
that movie for me -
i'll stop the world 
and melt with you -
i skip through it
in a few minutes...
of course, she's not
there anyway and i start
thinking what exactly

about - the hit the books

leia was in love with han solo...
so there are days when she requires
all my love, literally -
friends romans countrymen lend

don't think i have no pride,
i still didn't make no pasta...
reckless cleaning room and
kitchen her news reminds
me of the cuts my finger knife
sixteen july birkin
who killed jane not the squad
kid i think we been framed -
to miss someone you never
truly knew - "we blew it"
(- do we ever know anyone?
we only know them under
certain circumstances...)

dear leah it's not
that i ran away, what's
the frequency kenneth, it's
that i haven't figured out
out how to be platonic
without making imagined
emilee homicidal -
at least lara only
threatened to cut off
my penis, but the death 
penalty...where was i
ah yes typing with my

same with family in 
mind, then how is it

as squirming dog -
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs:

promise me you'll never leave,
alivia utters, in terms of emilee -
never divorce...so no pre-nup
hey hey my my...i guess if you
pay off your little sister with
the tie-dye tee as well as the

you get an enforcer, tyne daly
hello my name is doris, i listen
to hotel california with an entirely
new twist...i look at her picture

i never know what the poor girl's
gonna do to me next...
hate to tell you this, buddy,
but you have to wear clothes

if you look carefully at my lips
you'll realize i'm actually saying something

(money to bring
his wife and was working 
hard  to make enough washing 
and see if that will
their house) that is this poem...

He arose as dreams vanished. There was 
eros from the baby munchkin cake and
it made for a bit of conflict. No cornflakes,
pasta with 'a reckless moment'...
some "thoughts" were missing
and he downloaded them to play...
and right off the bat he wanted to say;
The purpose of his writing style
was to make new connections, indeed
to make it new. He knew he wanted
to make poetry for her,  yet the 
bullhead pants (wtap) obituary
beverly j boggs dowler wheaton
via philip hickman found him
watering the plants and so he 
settled in to wait upon wit a while.

The slacks were jeans he had
enslaved into the trash with a sensed
low class tracking system...
Now confirmed. 

This lacks the whip of sensation but
he considers nobody would believe
the dead sons appeared in the shut
sugar bowl after he did the dishes
and then mostly disappeared.

Like magic, no, like mayhem...
ahem. enough prelude.

He wrote as love envisioned.

lime juice and zest :

The peddler had certainly spoken the truth 
although he did not know what truth
daughter meant when declared

Your vanity has led you away.
Like masturbation
scrubbing it 
vigorously 

(is that what they think we do...)

The agency informs him;
'cutiekim' first date comment
finds 'raspberrypussy' no cat
how dare they act on 

(is someone out of innuendo?)

Then the race against lies

soap was irresistible

(further into the maze...)

To admit some excitement

at the constructed whore or virgin

either lessens love or heightens it...

Strangle neck / slap ass,

You see how fast it can go down

to no class at all, a lesson in

the salon of contradictions. 

or as the rolling stones put place it

every cop is a criminal & all the sinners

saints.

looks like someone else -

will you get tired of me, she asked

how could i when there are so

many faces in your face -

the ending of feeling Minnesota

between the lines...

did she know i was going to 

be short attention span circuited

at ellie eilish -

minneapolis ambush

civilian cop and shooter expired

los lobos singin' viking -

to be clear, i was playing

(in lime posset two start)

at the godfather of soul

and i did dream a cape woven

of bones...

(chimney made out of human skull)

 laid eyes upon hotel dream. 

memory making bracelets...

i had not recognized the  struggle

entrance door, don't leave. 

she's right about vultures...

 circuit span attention

preceeded by the beast in me

tell me who do you love



lime juice and zest :

 awed by the proportions 

of the satanic rhetorical

 the weight of  possession 

 captured to be released

in a secret  to silence 

cruel-lipped  oozing, 

learn your part a mind to lose

eggs this is not your brain

swiftly not even expunged

punt suggestion foot job

 muse, repeating the lyric

 a low, savage whisper.

Weak i  was; yes, and wicked, too; but

 turned me cold blooded with honor.

commonly interpreted to mean  

dentistry extracting the foes

that make her think she's

a shell a show -

this direction was the reported seat
	
of the in-progress.

i view 'pink string and sealing wax'

paying only attention to her

yet the trash needs to be put placed out

this bitch downstairs goes in and out pretending

a basement so she can come upstairs excaping

the comatose blubber she is paid to care for -

excapade on ice, menthol illegal most of the time

i write the haiku biscuit crumb before exhaling this

other bitches insisting she's an ugly little troll

not worth all my time much less all my love

i listen hoping she can't hear such hate

clean the back rooms, cook the meal

as promised - 

i remember i went to sleep that night -

awaking to her post about the ancients

eating all the silphium - golly i gotta cook.

maybe my love is more than i have learned

drawn to the last drop of pepsi, 

i had taken a bath in her depression.

anxiety soap, you see how annoying

 covered the notes

yet repeatedly aria 

down upon closer view.

miss grant it's me, there is nothing to worry about

 reinforcement—it's devotion.

too heavy to hold

she argues, i hold her still -

in sickness, health armoured

in death's counterfeit sleep dreams of her

in death after life desires we forever

or as she herself sort of said

i'd be so hot if i were real

-hint perhaps to keep my phantasy

on its toes- hail.

in one woman, yet my dreams whirl with strife.

pinballs but my pen'is rich. cannot teach
away lack of knowing, spy in the  house of love.
I do not steal, a line, it is blowin' in the wind...
so you didn't, see that film-heard song- or read,
well literature, my theft, is my own time
rhymes for emilee  and yes my cock.
how many roads? stands like a statue;

Lucy  has a solution for apathy

—an axe. 

So when she finds her poet

 intent on skipping the tribeca, 

it's off with his film festival. 

Right from the back seat,

axing did she even follow...


Unfortunately, he witnesses 

the deed, the first season of 

pretty little liars...

 Lucy is tried and judged 

criminally stereotyped...

montgomery, he plays

the clash right profile...
 



 
3/4 cup sugar:

She spends the next seven years 

at the break even rom com farm.

With Elvis to regain emotional stability.

 Upon her release, she nearly had him,

I've played Melanie, why not Emilee...


He even starts to like her tattoo collection. 

Then, life sentence and the podcast 

made him think, has she even read

Spengler... 

he goes steady with Emilee, 

the richest young girl in town....

Lucy attempts to get cast as a Bond 

girl, but settles for Kissinger in Paris -

troubled by dreams and flashbacks of her 

previous seven years as Aria

She envisions lying in bed with 

the severed heads of inky and emilee...


packing for Manhattan, she carefully organizes

the grenades...

The encounter proves too much and she
	  
she writes new curses on the back 
	  
of her cat on a hot tin roof poster

Let his penis wither, 
	  
let his bones crack, 
	  
let him see his legions drown in their own blood...

 Shortly after, inky cant help but write
	  
an interlude lime posset for her... 

Lucy fears he may have chopped up

the strait jacket story -

Carol screams, I want the truth

it's like an engram inside Cruise control. 

But Tom is blackmailed by Suri -

stop meddling with my right hand man... 

A short time later, mission impossible wraps.

What am I doing over here with the workers,
the gooks, the apes, the dogs, 
the errand boys,
the human animals?
Why don’t I come over with the board, 
and drink coca-cola or make it?

One evening, Inky tries to explain it all to Emilee.

It is not a happy affair. Little Red looked too much like Alivia!

In a rage, Lucy reminds everyone it's a party not a funeral -

Still the balcony had everyone thinking it was about money 

 not love,
	  
obviously, he only wants emilee for her finances!
	  
greed pursued by alone in his home 

he confronted L A WOMAN and COME ON LETS GO

with self comparisons - key of A...  

subsequently promising to help lucy work

with the luke warm coca cola...

a half step down from those chords -

	Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us...

doors locked some of them holding a knife -
	  
 In the film's ironic finale, the now magically not typecast

 Lucy prepares to make Emilee even richer...

Of course, not to be outdone she oils me on Nordic Ware

pan adjusting her strap on and slapping me into submission,

arrows and he has lost count
of the dead natives.
Come for his head, come to scalp into insanity-
Even playing, phantom marty big iron,
Grave remodels Claro, draw for it,
Texas red clone...I can't even, as they say...
I'm raising Arizona over in a moment-
"weaving an endless sentence"
bookmaker's stake, you know some ammo
keeps on truckin'
pause;
And in further'd, memory 
Olympics bronze silver gold, the nail scars are true
not for history; but for the faith. the belief.
all those fragile leaves, clinging to that tree -
like I believe Russia is no enemy,
Proof at 1945. Well, except for raping the German 
women...There are no women like our women...
Damn the beauty of that gravesite! what is your endgame,
ireland. 
 
alone,  with her picture
or even with, her there.
chained to earth like the vampire dyke.
 
The synonyms don;t always work
in the newly found image;
she wears stars little and shiny,
across her collar,
it is not a wish of death, yet dying ain't we all.
 
Meanwhile, if you live it up you won't live it down,
other tom, i'm still in a wait, She went and took,
Contemporary that California trip
Against my colon and aromas. I get Jealous
Stagnant, even horny; I'm sure she wants to 
say I love you likewise or more...

yet even facing each other:
 
we will be bottled up,
Do you take this woman?  marriage when?
I took this woman three years ago
here an anniversary song, shaking from the lost,
Emilee exact date !
 
since curtain I am not staff - only an individual;
memory, validation for the shoe,
it was this time of the season...
i looked away not thinking not knowing
the truth, the love...
then the interruption, the delay,
how could there be anyone else...
air vanishing, i was dizzy...
 
not even recording for six months.
And all that day, becomes another day:
 
until evening falls and she calls,
cat quick my purr none of it matters 
shell or show only she mattress...
only she married...breathe
everything is fine but i can't use 
them pictures and i can't hear the name
 
which set such distractions;

even the other day, even today, tonight
it's all toxicesque, a jazz too fast to groove
making me wonder if madness
 
has been taking extra vitamins
but sanity needs her, needs that anniversary,
even the contrast and cost...
of it all since it proves a feeling,
like playing crosby i'm through with love
all afternoon weeping while she worked salon.

 
hennessy story my line about her smile,
was no allusion to work poster,
 
i'm not wearing any panties --
well we could, always adopt,
although the pregnant dream was so reel, real,
 
rael innocent even if guilty;
my virgin saint, 
 
i'm exhausted and i ate too much.
too bad it wasn't your pussy,
maybe a bit later, 
don't get me wrong, sex
 
not, with fears, cannibalism,

Although a bite or, mooning nibble upon bare hill
thrill still into a quev'ring
ah yes even to coin new word,
 
che guevara,
bolivia  blur stares at the new world order;

i take five tic tacs.

with a marlboro:
cigarette, ashes move before me,
 
the rainy night knows i am afraid.
The live wire pain sudden and vicious,
soul casino, even if i have placed no bet
well alien probes and satanic spirits trying 
on a talent like suspenders, spies
lift and leave, sometimes i think it's you,
insisting on something perhaps i cannot hear.
here...
Being more than they, 
hey, do you really love the smiths...
 
GE wandered into Chinatown bank.
sorry if i kissed like onion, 
i have a neverending need in red or white,
the fan whirls.
hoping to win the fender,
 
play you a love song,
that rises above the trite, something trippy.
traveling far away into tomorrow,
maybe even like this canto
3/4 cup sugar my dear anniversary sweetheart.

The girl in dream, I'm sitting here with grin, she was holding a diploma, 

two fans blazing, then put-placing art over it. rain yet tinted with hotness.

I'm sure i dreamt other things, five June listin news calls I say yeah but

still debating it within myself...twenty twenty five seems a long ways 

away, things like that time I went dream apartment hunting with 

Caitlin...No one is yet to explain Ibiza to me...weren't it Max, Erin

oh kneel, is that why the American in Russia saunters into mind?

in any case, reason eight why i can't remember my dreams lately...

pretty sure it was new Manhattan York city - maybe it was even

Emilee, all I think about...all i care about today, said Lucy - 

Elton's barrel full of monkeys(,, Johnny the bossman* )handing

out bananas, I hope she is fine in her jury chair - where was I,

oh yes, despite the fact that dang Adobe went no more draw

or photoshop mix, flashback Serif (does my art really hold such

power that actual corporations shit I mean shift away products...)

I was feeling all right, thinking of the old bag, affectionately marie

anne - wd'ave put you in seven but sometimes when the thought

bomb goes off i can't jugle it all - idea run at arm...maybe someday

not a transition but a song quote you'll see that it's true

there was no greater love than what i had for you...

now then there, i'm with the grin 'cause suri was racing

around the big apple...i;d mentioned here right before

and enjoyed the near synchronicity, hell, i even took

out the Clorox and mop all the way to the living room...

*(that's what waters muddy called winter not the season -)

i'm not certain sure why he's considered a great given

that not really lead player nor an operatic voice,

still hard again is genius in terms of blues -

bliss at the rest of Miss Grant takes Richmond,

I asked my friends about her, but all their lips were tight -

our lips are seal'd. meal again onion rice chicken...

there's something divine about it most likely from

keira posting posing next to emilee...angel necklace

slave ring metallic teal toes...sixteen glass panel

window painted sea green with an anchor sticker

venus symbol above a heart...lean out your window

goldenhair, no i still don't know how i hit that double

triplet sounding ring, don't even think it can be tabbed...

while dancing with the thought that she was actually

right here, i got so shy i'm sure i blushed, i even sort 

of hoped she hadn't read some of the words herein,

why did i let it get so beatnik naked in terms of 

emotion -  cut reaction line, bring out

Lazarus machine for juice zest and sugar...

the future bleeds through -

i didn't get to sleep til after three again,

even had to overcome a sudden migraine as if the

spirit of fifi had visited, she of headaches when 

sexless...awaking near noon to lower back pain

as if someone had tried to fold me into a suitcase...

but maybe it was only the kitchen...at ritual meditation

i felt all right - forty minutes, graduated digestion

chainsmoke -  i felt i could even sing you're not

alone.

he however wore hearted sleeves in his writing,,,

merry web

"Middle English oistre, borrowed from Anglo-French oistre, ostre, 
going back to Latin ostrea, ostreum "bivalve mollusk, oyster,"
 borrowed from Greek óstreion, óstreon, of uncertain origin..."

origin...well sure some "critics" want you to be original,
what is new under the sun gunnin at the shade,
go ahead leave your newborn without
learning or notes and it will only
be idiot...a tale told, then heard no more!

the source here is all that happens as it happens -

We all know the Beach Boys couldn't

wait for June - Good Vibrations - 

I can see-feel the why reasons -

Six June seduced me and 

kept me up nearly into dawn -

no relation to the dish washing soap -

Of course, it wasn't the late night,

wasn't the day or date...A not so

simple twist of fate -

Reaching through air, through

space and time to make 

rhymes with her in rhythm's 

rhythm. A rhythm which swayed

into dreams. Dreams...Therein

ourselves asleep dreaming 

a nap, perhaps a sofa, maybe

it was my sofa bed -  retired

from living room and now

serving martin acoustic

and Ibanez electric...

sceptic glances - she is 

undressing yet not nude -

i am drooling in my mind

hopefully not rude - 

deep into her eyes, she is 

looking back at me -

the ronettes shld've been

singing be my baby -

turn my head

secret glances

her sister above my skull

i can't hear her words

septum ring smiles

i was wondering why

she seems fearless of the sun -

emilee has two sisters

these are my sisters...

crumbles the question

we have no dildos

possibly then i explain

it's literature too and 

dramatic effect...

et cetera in terms of 

big pink stun gun

not a recommendation 

something shoots emilee

a bit in the distance perhaps 

to dance - prancing in another

girl moves the blanket covering 

my bones, i look down at her,

at my boner - i don't want to make

the connection, the number you 

have reached is no longer in service,

please check the number and dial again -

i get up and it's only ten in the morning -

more in love than i had been even if

interrupted - i'll buy no dick, albino

winter that stranger sure sounded 

alike the dark side of the moon

track same year - i decide suddenly

during the ritual to set up for 

a new recording - lucky town -

i put it together, key of E

but when I strum along it is 

in F - well, maybe C...

i record two vocals quickly

escaping the deliveries 

i stacked on purpose all during

the calls to cancel my subscription

listin ounce don't throw

and tell the phone company why

i haven't paid the bill, so it all 

dissolves into a density they can't

crawl through as i lettuce myself

lime olive oil turkey sandwich

The record was released nearly immediately...

I wrote that song a few years ago, c major,

f major, g major...I always credit James

Caan as co-writer, but I don't want to explain it -

when i jotted down the notes for actually

recording it - it was f sharp minor,  E major,

C major, A major, Asus2...

but, as it turned out more like f /b flat/ g/ c...

done quickly on a headphone mix which

when heard on laptop speakers made me sick

as the drums held a sort of ten k frequency slpash

- a rinky dinky sound that took a couple of hours

to manage... at that point i couldn't hear what

i was doing...i decided to spectral pan the 

beat and hoped that my instinct (on headphone)

had been right concerning the rest of it - 

of course, being me, right after ritual "meditation"

i went in for a second take, this time in the key of A,

asus, bsus2, e major 6 (i think) which then breaks

into f#m & e but with a flip back note since i liked

the sound - again two vocals but this time used parts

of either take since i did not pronounce sweet as you 

in the first take - i had intended to imitate the 

Andrew Sisters' bugle boy 

you know that growl...

but when i got to it, my main 

concern was simply escaping into myself and this time

the only glitch was guitar volume, but that didn;t take 

so long to settle - yes i listened to the first (released)

version against this new one and even i don't know which

one works better...i called the second one lucky town 9,

estimating the number of rendered tracks since the first -

obviously lime posset ten is only keeping the title

and format, but not going for the intricate poetics...

as they say, just saying or even js

nothing to do with javascript -

in the wee hours i envision fbi agents attempting

to capture...me? well, maybe it was only a movie

memory...

in sleep, i dream of several people on the floor,

pale, seemingly horny...some are masturbating -

two men and several women, perhaps one couple

is having intercourse ---  i don't feel surprised

or even curious, i look at one woman and watch 

her also take to the floor, alone...i think, to touch

herself...there's something of a blur, no distinct

faces or features...i awake and think nothing of

it except until the following evening, a few hours

ago when i felt the scene re-live like an echo

in peripheral imagination myself not excited

only confounded - i sleep again not getting

out of bed and find myself baffled by someone

from the supermarket giving a speech about

the virgin mary - i don't care if it rains or 

freezes as long as i got my plastic jesus -

dashboard of the dream, i noonish get up

almost running from the scene - there's no 

trust there and it wasn't even in my language -

i shampoo my hair with a sudden back pain -

street legal set up to take out the trash - 

imaginary

crash into me both hips pain so severe i sit me down -

breathe and wonder who or what - 

when then order kfc, mostly to facilitate recording

so as to not worry about fixing a meal or dishes - 

1940 a film called he married his wife...

it's entertaining enough and of course the thought

of wife or married makes me think of emilee, although

constantly in my thoughts...

yes - i first met suri cruise in LaGuardia

when i lived in blue white bathroom with skankbang girls -

she's on her way to Carnegie Mellon

we wish her all possible success in Pittsburgh

but i notice as i ramble through my thinking into words

that i haven't mentioned emilee too much here -

maybe i am trying to give nine the chance to firm itself

to film its motion picture production in its selected

locations - the powers that be seemed to pick up

and plug into California...myself i cannot say

what the side effects will be, i can say it was 

not my target...volusia
		    
the sheriff called it pretty shocking -

as holly hills took over chief and captain resigned...

mailer told me if you kill a cop in the states 

point blank you are punk -

he didn't mean that in a rocking way -

i certainly don't mean or aim to be a punk - 

but as i pulled the proverbial ring from grenade

vest poem my mind whispered, for Mathilda...

lando, land ho - 

singing songs of shady sisters
and old time liberty
songs of love and songs of death
and songs that set men free

in any case, it may be that i was overwhelmed 

by something she said "a metaphor"

(i want my hair to go up in flames
for the one i love 
to paradoxically be ignited and extinguished
only by their touch
to burn and burn
and have them catch fire beneath me)

"lust and longing" she may be late

for i long ago fell into the burning  fire

down down down as in the song the flames 

went higher...yet what a nearly perfect poem.

perhaps writing here today not wanting

to throw my hat in the ring -

yes let that be the verse of the day tonight.

trying to not football myself into dreams -

do you hear voices, i'll pay you back -

don't we all - no idea who might be talking -

everybody's talking, way past midnight

cowboys, i'm walking here -

wonder if i'm being too aggressive

in my own fan tah sea -

swimming into dreams with the 

day starting, i find myself dreaming

of keira, she had been on my mind

yet i wasn't sure why as i wasn't certain

about the dreams - vague conversations,

alike sitting around speaking without

trying for a keeping...in the mid morning,

i awake to the sound of a foreign

tongue, is it a las tres, or is it ala trez

third tine of an antler's beam

perhaps allah tress, akbar - but allah

is also a woman's name in the cyrilic -

i cycle through these thoughts feeling

still keira and missing emilee -

still, i don't want to crowd her - 

then and there or here now where

readers might decode it as repetition - 

i can't help it, as she says it

how you feel is how you feel about it,

paraphrase...yes i could be fiction,

make something up to entertain

but why should i? do i have to prove

anything - no. i daydream, i have a

all of it together is overwhelming -

need, but not these, no cough cough -

i carve out a plan -  i call a taxi

experiences while sauntering - 

virgin olive oil, rice, friskies, and

a hundred and twenty cigarettes

no make that a hundred and sixty -

women in tight white dresses glide

by on their way to atm -

i decide to tip the cashier that

said hey instead of the sour faced

one that has merged with the register

and has become more machine than human -

back home, in minutes, but some ghostly

hamstring hounds my left leg, i sit in the

disperse...who is the disaster, your guess

"Now I'm twenty one years, I might make twenty two

And I don't mind dying but for the love of you

And if fate should break my stride

Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride..."

 remember this room do I 
I could close my eyes and paint you a portrait 
with my big toe 

 at my wedding was I 
 [Music]
would you like to order now 

 love is calling us to transform 
 knocked oh my goodness 
 I can't remember anything but us 

oh stop stalking me
 she's the smartest thing 
she knows just what we're talking about 

 man you you you fat Flathead 
 I seem to detect a faint glimmer of  juicy 
 insult to you I want to communicate my feelings 

we're going down to Hillsboro
 I hear him will you please go down
 and tell him that he's honking up the wrong tree 

 I think you're a very nasty little boy 
 well goodbye Mama goodbye 
 ladies and gentlemen he's remounting 

yes he's he's up again 
 Restless as the horses 
 I pronounce a swivel neck 


 I pronounce claim that you two 
are here by neck and neck 
 they're turning into the stretch 

gone to the whip it's going
 wild come on come on 
almost a picture finished picture

Nuseirat, words i didn't know -

she's looking at another "artist"

I see the word count nearing fifteen hundred -

as nine skips ten into eleven,

free hornet eq plug in i think i miss

but then the email arrives with receipt -

in my dream, ironic humour, being only

a scene wherein i seen a picture of emilee

with a flashing triangle on the lower left corner-

earlier someone showing me a basketball

saying it is inspired by an orange -

meanwhile in the fridge

paramount rotting, i notice later...

i get up already late in the afternoon -

the room humid, my skin icky...

and my emotions getting a talking to...

look dear feelings, you love her obviously

but don't stress worry over a sensation

that is beyond your control - could be

foes doing those double speak lies -

could be they may even be trying to 

get her to see you as her enemy -

worst case scenario jealousy

marry me too or i will cc rider

dreams fading under the  tragedy

elvis concert starts...

i take up the job to remake the 

wordstar index html using

sea harvest, newsy css, and video -

it had been for a new artistic idea

page, but i liked it too much

details going into nearly nine 

in the evening - i make pasta

watch obsession otherwise

known as the hidden room - 

the puppy reminds me of bijoux -

so at this point too much for a short 

story, about a novella, but in 

continuation, a novel if edited...

I've used the word love sixty two 

times, it seems both too much

and not enough.

how do we know you are really a writer,

write something - yes, write something -

i turn to face my dreams, but there's a

man hammering through the standing walls,

taking my mind into curves i cannot turn...

making my body feel as if outside

and under sun i get up like a white

moon through grey clouds - late in 

the after nobody noon, soon a 

cigarette, some more coffee...

how many times have i done this -

vision of the sight before the clatter

noise claimed imagination -

yes, i was dream dream dreaming

but not alone as i felt myself with

emilee...not that i could see her yet

by my side...a spiritual irony, i suppose -

then i'm facing both keira and ashley -

missing london, have i become england...		    

as if someone reading had merged

words into a raid - or the dark crystal

idea insisting we restore balance to

thra by taking down the skeksis -

welcome to annexia,

yes, welcome to annexia...

yet presently my personal hero's

journey only involves proving to

emilee that i'm faithfully waiting

even asleep, yet in the dream

as if entering a surreal circus

i race with one of these women

through a rising and lowering

series of steps, steps of silk -

I've already gone the distance

we celebrate now thumb sized

the ant's a centaur in his dragon 

kingdom - i can't imagine what

it meant, dream not canto line -

from gulliver's reverie i get 

up a coughy irritation throat

i can't tell if it;s ive fang as it had been

similar once upon a time

or if i'm still haunted by the

crown choker actually

called queen necklace...

emilee are you -

emilee is it -

nine in the morning

i look at the index code

website update

play a bit brew smoke

calm neck - 

and return to no 

dream for banging. 

i turn to face my cat

further apology, but he 

seems to understand.

i turn to face my self

finding only love's desire

for emilee...all i know

is that i miss you and

i feel safe in your arms.

thirteen June an hour after

going to sleep i dream of 

hearing some disturbance

beyond my room...

there's money in there -

the words slow and viciously

excited ring in my ear -

a crowd in living room

someone tells me that

other people had broken in -

i look at the yet how door

not even thinking of the locks

on the adjacent gate -

it is twisted, carved in at 

the bolt mechanism -

a woman approaches

I know you

I say from an office

job I never had -

realizing I am not fully

dressed i go to my clothing

room for ready to wear 

but there is a man there

moving things around

- the cat is there as well-

nobody can touch these

things, i have a very precise

system - he pulls out a cd

and puts it into a player

that i do not have -

I say that stereo

has no speakers -

no hay banda, yet a sort 

of jazz blazes through

I look at a statue that

I also do not have - 

it's faith and she's kissing

some boy, in front of them

another statue and it's 

tilly and she's saying I've

never done this, also 

becoming intimate -

someone darts out

from beside me

it's my cousin,

reportedly homosexual

but I've not seen proof -

he grabs and pulls my

wrist, i wriggle away -

writing now recall smacking

him with a belt -

well, we were kids,

imagine giving up a medical

career to suck dick or

take it up the ass -

surely it would kill Adolfo

his father one of my uncles

retro alpha male military 

personality never served

still freeloading on salute

alone, i suppose -

i'm still a kid, how did 

life get so serious -
 
i walk the few steps

of the inner hallway

back to main living room

where they are replacing

furniture, it looks nice

but what does it all mean...

as i ponder the question,

i get up half thankful that

it was a dream and half 

wondering what emilee

might be doing - i suspect

she's with Alivia or perhaps

worried over her little sister -

prayed to the lord for 

a loving mother or blonde

hair...has the latter,,,

letter someone urging me

to write this all down - 

and i agree but I've had this

sort of scene before except

without faith or tilly -

and certainly without

daydreaming that emilee

is giving me head - 

you married a whore!

a dirty little whore!

diseased whore!

whoa, for all i know she

is a virgin - 

people will talk, libel

slander et cetera - 

me i'm happy

that usually the

writing occupation

ain't sexualized...

one simply sits

there type tap type tap

nothing sexy about it -

unlike say music

or painting which 

indeed might be pretty sensual...

abortion pill nine to zero

reform bill in Argentina approved -

i look at the news to see if there

are other reasons why sleep interrupted,

buzzsprout deleted podcast

actually a stones cover...

they sure give a lot of warnings -

gloria's souls craves intimacy...

monika asking if i have seen

her jogging, looking for a nsa

partner...i can only think of beate

hopefully they will release her -

Jayla says it has all led to this...

friend with benefit...

melina loves me loves "us" together

remember, from starbucks -

actually never sat at one...

visited one on the east side
		    
 the time me and mom 

had to pee and it was the only

place i could think of...

alice sends nude pictures

tongue out tattoo on thigh

sigh, zolaxx does not see how

i am single, obviously hasn't 

received the wedding invitation -

anonymous tits out

if my left leg is thanksgiving

and my right leg is xmas

why don't i come between

holidays...

omfg, and christin is 

stepping up her "game" -

there's not a twitch in my cock

over all these messages -

not with emilee in my thoughts -

when they informed mae west

that ten men were at her door,

she said, send one away 

i'm feeling a bit tired...

i'm not weary, yet the only

message i want is from ms grant -
	  
let's see then, ah yes, return

to sleep, to dream other dreams.

dateline new Zealand, when my astrologer suggested,

(with a hint of enthusiasm) that I should go outside,

I never expected to find myself on the other side of the

world...Is it actually legal for a teenage girl to deliver 

pizza on the heels of the cutiekim delivery vulgarity?

So, I'm dream walking with the astrologer but it is

so calming and peaceful that there is really nothing to report,

or how do you translate a sigh...

i dream of other girls, but it is as if emilee has allowed me,

perhaps for the sake of avoiding the label of being possessive,

to see some other faces...it is all pretty quick and very much

platonic - the only one that was different was dreaming

of Havana topless - actually posted a see through 

Instagram post captioned something alike it made 

me feel euphoric...well before euphoria home box

officed...she was walking down the street, but

like gif not irl therein a superimposed man also

topless appears to be snatching the chain that 

is yet attached to her neck - 

it leads to an argument, someone accusing 

me of imitating lennon...in the dream i start

singing instant karma with a horrible tone 

as if i am being squeezed...so my holiday 

is not complete...if a man rides in an elevator

with Shirley Horn, he should not ever have to sound like

that -  horny cats in heat make more melodious

lines...in another dream i speak to sir Mick or 

rather listen quietly while he makes a recommendation -

middle of the night film, as if Kim Novak is introducing

the age of aquarius...but it also a film that makes

anyone feel they were born in the wrong time and place -

a silent frenzy, which has obviously only gotten 

more drastic and more silent with each passing decade...

i sign up to cosmos,so - however haunted by 

the ello.co fiasco - so, co, you see it rhymes...

hopefully it will work out...

rex Harrison and carole landis did not work out -

i watch behind  green lights,

almost witty yet learning of her unaliving herself

makes me wonder, her family insists rex

had a hand in it and that she was extremely

happy right before even planning her travel

overseas for a film production...

of course, i have nothing to say on the subject,

except it is queer that he was the last person

with her and the one to "find" her telling the 

maid downstairs of the death upstairs before

climbing up the steps...

in any case, he made a few films about spirits -

i suppose to claim a lyric was given to me

by lennon would sound unusual 

yet i stand by "easter" and I've heard

jerry Garcia say matter of factly that

ancient verses of songs floated into

his mind while standing there strumming -

this doesn't mean he is pretending to be

Elizabeth cotton, it simply happened -

he wasn't in command of those spirits

and my awful rendition in dream was

the sarcasm in me reminding whoever

that i am not in the practice of summoning

inspiration as if making a phone call or

posing as any of the greats that have influenced

my way of making music -  et cetera..

you're not my type, typo in left ear -

Havana is the only muse i feel i have 

never been with -

i wake up each day of these two dream

scenes reaching for emilee -

My defense turns into, yes it was attraction and

yes it is admiration but some of that was feeding

off my love for Emilee Grant...It would not be fair

to you, nearly a movie star! To be a runner up...

No, no - let me finish getting you out of this 

typecasting and then we can continue this

conversation, don't hurt me, I'm a real live

fan...Even if I wroted an opera, I would not

call the monologue songs arias, let's be

friends. 


It's no use, she has a one-way mind

to bend mine into her way of thinking -

You weren't thinking about Emilee

when I got you so hard it hurt, were you?


Lookit that was months ago

 I was still trying to - I didn't understand

everything the way I do now, please be happy

for me...


all right but i'm keeping the doll so if you

break your promise to be my friend

there'll be no hesitation on my part

to put the pins back in even deeper...

	  LIME POSSET SIXTEEN EPILOGUE
		
double cream:	
___________


(if you've only glanced
at the stone scripted
version of that film,
do yourself and see 
the one from 1930s...)


i feel i am home, meaning 3k,

some sort of date, a nice girl,

after a while i think of luiza
 
- perhaps something to do

with bar louie...

but that might be because

i'm always thinking of 

emilee - 

in the dream, some

men from distant past

are looking at me, most

likely for the girl -

one of them wearing 

a western styled cowboy

shirt which i commentize -

yet while i;m talking

the girl leaves - 

another girl tells me 

the direction of her steps -

so it is not home, a cafe

a figaro place from the 

village or paris so maybe it

is lumani - 
	  
a voice so unique

i cannot believe it is real

i even thought to deal 

when i had no emilee meal

months ago the steal
	  
i tell the information

girl to pass along a message

for the waiter, i didn't skip out

on the bill and will return to 

settle it - now it looks

as if i;ve crossed onto

central park west -

i catch up to her and 

she says she decided 

to go to some job

was it a hotel -

for chance of money -

i hand her a hard cover

book and magazine

- you left the gift i gave you

and she takes them all while

joining a girlfriend - 

as i turn back 

i awake overwhelmed

by the noon day heat -

so much so that i forget

all the details until

i seduce their memory

by some casual magic

you know abracadabra

but i could have easily

kept wondering why

it was a very good year

was playing in my mind -

blue blooded girls 

of independent means

balcony to battle

gets of people 

airline slamming Hawaii

exist stay burning

second forever sentenced

fire in the vagina

avery busted in north carolina

sehorn five hundred drinks

has case after pond

narrative pumps

you dysfunctional enviorment

elderly woman out knocked 

los angeles

how much waffle house...

what was monsieur lambert

trying to say to me in the

other scene i missed

we the nearsighted

i say to myself

at least i didn;t

have to wield a sword

the ends saying

there can be only

splash pad -

long about a Saturday night

splish - for twenty dollars

you can get one too,

here "quoteing" Skynyrd -

you know that other

song i could write a book

well in my case two...

substances unequal inside the magnets

pulling through divides

gem sides marked

their tribes alike Ukraine 

nitpicker insists africans can indeed read

smh. lol. 

When you're layin' in an alley with your head blown off,

 maybe you'll learn how this business ought to be run.

i swim to the florida keys

pick up the memory, pounding the pavement

Seven of 'em. Lined up against a wall.

 Mowed down just like that. They didn't have a chance.

Now, that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all this riffraff into the room?

Nice little thug. He give 'em a writ of hocus pocus.

i had the steak and rice from the freezer -

onions melted, anya reminding me 

how good it used to be...

You're a butcher! That's what you are! You're a butcher!

Abyssinia, baby!

i put a five spot on the extra fan -

grifters and crumbs have put placed

the breeze in the big house

the kind of heat that could cover you 

in a Chicago overcoat

back then a Cadillac was what we'd

call an ounce of cocaine -

you and me both

think of a kilo

or a couple of them

they got squat

i make tracks within the poetry

link word to kill

off the cob nitwittery

let me put my meathooks

all over that looker

grant emilee

we'll have a ring a ding ding

i hitchhike up to central

florida

but someone must be on the jiggle juice

"Mcdonald's employee fucked like a slut"

someone says making burgers

and fucking, that is all cunts

are good for - 

i wonder what their opinion of men might be...

down the river of golden dreams

they won't let me 1930s

even if only bumping gums

take off my hoosegows and socks

double check the locks.

<pre>

	weird, you know, i hardly ever felt such an 

inclination to write, type - yesterday - as

i searched for the dream note which would

or does appear in what turns out to be the

last double cream...lime posset...
	
the writing software (which i started

using after the incident with tab

iron butterfly at index) -notepad-

went haywire, saving every tab i had opened

since the recording of exile's letter...

well, asking if i wanted to make changes or

save...that sort of thing...so by the time i 

got to it, the enthusiasm well, like

the way the porter explained 'drink'

leads to lechery...provoking the desire

yet taking away the performance - 

my drink was no libation - only

the unexpected turn of technology -

all this and the rising temperature,

got me thinking, let it go the way

it stands - i will pour in more notes

elsewhere at another time - place...

space, the final frontier oh wait

i don't want to boldly go - 

meanwhile setting up some

art  wordstar.nexus/δίπτυχα	 

it's sort of pronounced

ziptych...i had been thinking

triptych...the eyes have it...

although it sure feels like

some people don't enjoy the

fact that i am a visual artist -

"The void and the vista
the fugitives gone
I'll see you there
at the Hotel Vast Horizon
All them authorizations
we must have missed
are just the dictions dissolving
when we kissed"...

still some of it as godly

good as that whitley tune -

i clean up kitchen
	
even laundry and self

watch ten cents a dance -

1931 with leftovers and lettuce,

feeling a bit like bradley

carlton nothing but 

everything for barbara o'neill

in this case grant the emilee -

in a crowded dream i saunter

nearer to her, she turns, 

it's as if seeing her face 

for the first time - 

but it's always that way -

i inhale, taking in the brightness

she exhales, 'i knew you would

wait for me'

	eleventh hour fare thee well sixteen june twenty twenty four



		      
hmm...14 July 2025. 
		i dedicated June to not much at all - 
		it felt as if i had wroted a novel 
		instead of dream notes...i kept 
		wondering over the puzzle of the 
		last penned dream herein...it  
		was too vivid, maybe too much... 
		i only knew that i had to end 
		the notes there in order to  
		start over...it was an estimated 
		three hundred pages if double spaced - 
		well, i've put those away and here 
		goes...monday, daria called her 
		puppy her soulmate...i felt in  
		a daze...on the fifth of july, 
		i happend to see a picture of 
		two friends, children...i kept  
		wishing i hadnt seen it, but 
		even as cut off as i am from  
		most folks and i suppose even  
		some of my own emotions, that 
		scene really got to me... 
		i was in the middle of writing 
		some new songs and wrote four 
		verses...the fourth was left out 
		when it came to recording -  
		it took a couple of days to settle  
		into it...when i finally escaped 
		noisy distractions, the sudden phone 
		calls insisting on either hanging up or 
		pointless trivia, the strange hound 
		seemingly in search of boy-vagina, 
		and an insane argument about the beach... 
		(what else could it be except madness when 
		i have no inclination or desire to sit in the sun) 
		oh yes and the bizarre 'no input' mystery 
		which i suppose is all part of the process, like 
		pound might say... indeed, when i finally escaped 
		nothing mattered but the work at hand...i called 
		it 'the fifth of july' and put it out for release 
		with these lyrics; 
		<BR>
		I KNEW LILA WAS DEAD  
		- HOPED ELOISE WOULD SURVIVE; 
		SHE LOVED HER PUPPY DOG,  
		SHE HADNT EVER BEEN WED. 
 
		A HOUSE DANCED  
		ON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED 
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS  
		YEAH SOMEHOW STAYED... 
 
		I COULDNT TELL HANNAH AND REBECCA APART 
		- THEY WERE TWINS LIKE 
		FLOWERS IN A FIELD'S GARDEN  
		- IT'D BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT FROM THE START 
		 
		A HOUSE DANCED 
		UPON A RIVER  
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED) 
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS 
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED... 
		<BR>
		LITTLE BLAIR COULDNT UNDERSTAND  
		- SHE WEPT SHE CRIED; 
		LITTLE BROOKE COVERED HER  
		SAYING COME ON GIRL HOLD MY HAND 
		
		 
		A HOUSE DANCED  
		UPON A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED 
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS 
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED... 
		<BR>
		
		A HOUSE DANCED  
		UPON A RIVER  
		(A RIVER'S SONG AS IT PLAYED) 
		LONE STAR STATE OF TEXAS  
		WE SOMEHOW STAYED... 
		<BR>         
		      
		      i'd put placed all four verses on vsco from  
		handwritten notes photographed along with the chords 
		which remained the same...save for an added note 
                musical note.  
		as i glance through recollections, wondering why julia 
		mecey and joey king enjoy love island, wondering if 
		charles bukowski actually dropped a man at the race track 
		as in the italic section of factum or even why sylvia 
		plath's ghost doesnt haunt the hell out of matt haig... 
		i remember that night, the fourth of july... 
		i dreamt something like a bridge or a dam where the water 
		was red, crimson, but in that nearly dried blood brown color 
		and i couldn't see where i was but i saw a man holding a shotgun 
		and he did not move or speak, the motionless image against the  
		waves were etched in my mind the following day...i thought it 
		was about a guitar that had been slow to arrive and that 
		possibly it had suffered in transit yet by the time i went to 
		sleep again it felt revealed...well, decyphered...neither spirit 
		nor worry could save these lives from the devastation waltz 
		winding its way in what they call flash flood alley... 
		i was certain it was william s burroughs, a man who knew 
		about loss in an intimate way...aside from the wife, his only 
		son had perished and even in the afterlife i suppose some 
		emotions keep, all you can do is stand there and bear witness 
		i learned also that gabrielle's mother and my own share 
		a birthdate as it were... 
		i don't want to write anymore about these things as in  
		typing i might not reflect how much i felt and much less 
		how it all still hurts and will continue to hurt so many... 
		so i re-order that guitar and continue to wait... 
		i have a few dreams to jot, but those will be done 
		at some other point in time when i can turn my minimalist 
		writing into an even more concise style so as to not end 
		up with a book-length manuscript that might only serve 
		self-references... 
		
		 
		 
		16 july 2025 
		 
		i consider yesterday notable even if i don't 
		fully examine it here... 
		learning another side of the camp story... 
		what was her name, hayden...well she spoke 
		kinda like how i speak... 
		the second axe was shipped on the 11th 
		and arrived on the 15th 
		it felt as if my writing had manifested it... 
		reminds me of the telecaster except it  
		has a decided rock and roll tone 
		(no single coil pick ups) 
		i decorated it while listening to mustang sally 
		for a minute, everything else took a back seat 
		meaning it was thrilling... 
		i'm thinking now of a dream i had in may 
		i'd been with lotta in my old apartment 
		she kissed me and it was magical 
		we lay there talking about what the next meal 
		should be when a man with gun started shooting 
		at me and i ran into another room 
		there is a bookend dream to this scene which 
		i will jot later... 
		she's watching the summer i turned pretty 
		which i looked at but found revolting 
		i'm wearing a snake ring on my middle finger 
		instead of my stainless steel spoon since 
		some sort of rust invaded it... 
		anyway i awoke with a racing heart and  
		the realization of how much she means to me 
		hmm...when i said not much in june i meant movies too 
		although i did watch most of the secret life  
		of the american teenager 
		well, this was more than i intended to note... 
		let's leave it at that - for now - 
		here are two outtakes of the song i mentioned 
		i had the intent to adjust my release for one of 
		these but i couldn't figure out how to do that 
		and i am aware that this sort of takes the 
		expectation away from the single but i want  
		to share these as a way of saying it is 
		not about streams or whatever, it is what it is.

		      17july2025 
		       
		      correction, the mustang only sounded like
		      that through the boss amp...at the fender,
		      it was much nicer...yes i was fender-reluctant,
		      but since i don't much use pedals, the champ
		      amp was only logical...as for the guitar,
		      i kept hearing a line from blind willie mctell
		      when i would go window shopping for axes until
		      finally i didn't want to be haunted by it...
		      it is a step up from the ancient mustang i 
		      had which hardly ever stayed in tune but it
		      is not for big hands, even mine feel it to 
		      be a task going up the fret as if i had to
		      abbreviate my fingers which is the exact 
		      opposite of the jackson wherein my hands
		      sense and appropiate the space...
		      at least i feel a sort of bulgari vibe with
		      my new ring...still, all this goes against
		      my attempt at brevity and i have yet to
		      jot the dream note...hmm, notes..
		      connie francis died and her song had
		      recently become a hit again...even a parody
		      emerged, "you can touch my pussy..." which might
		      have been the cause of her demise...but
		      many several poets also passed away
		      and i had the evil urge to make a list
		      of all the writers that had perished
		      after 'the tortured poets depart-ment'
		      hmm...but what really worries me is
		      the grammar when gender is made illogical-
		      andrea is called 'they' instead of she -
		      here is quote/example:
		      "Their father, Mark, worked for a post office
		      and their mother, Shirley, was a secretary at a 
		      technical college. They have one sister, Laura."
		      this plural form makes language more of a virus
		      than it needs to be, indeed and why? 
		      where was i...ah yeah, i find 
		      lately that i go to sleep only to awake 
		      an hour or so later simply to wander
		      around in confusion...that was the case
		      last night, but first the bookend thing;
		      i had walked into a shop with julia and
		      told her to get something to drink, there
		      were only cans of coors in the fridge...
		      we walked out and there and then several
		      men harassed us, one of them with a stick
		      that knocked the hat off my head...it had
		      been a goodly time until then...weeks later
		      i learned that she had lost her red baseball cap -
		      cut to yesterady, i'm in the bath and the bath
		      is overflowing, i am trying without luck to 
		      shut off the water as somehow there are more
		      knobs than i care to count, i say the words
		      julia help but as i do i find the right knob
		      then we are on a bed where a cat climbs up,
		      i remark that it is not skirt and i think of
		      hedwig who it resembles but as a kitten - 
		      the cat speaks and i wonder if we have all gone
		      crazy...i awake and can't get back to sleep until
		      half a pack of cigarettes and coffee argue with
		      melatonin...i kept seeing romy mars although i 
		      only 'met' her at some far away chanel thing...
		      i like her especially since she positively proves
		      my point that sofia was and is pretty...the only 
		      thing is it makes mayhem of my fantasy life...
		      love her ego song - so catchy...
		      she had a bad scene at some hotel, in my dream
		      which i thought was about michael madsen, another
		      poet, i was in the elevator trying to get to the
		      twenty ninth floor - there was no 29 button,
		      someone pressed all the buttons and i got out
		      on seventeen determined to navigate the stairs -
		      1920s elegance surrounded me, someone with a 
		      glass case of coins, collectables, and aritfacts
		      was set up like a cigarette girl might be and 
		      i stopped for a glance there and then noticing 
		      a man seemingly having a heart attack nearby,
		      i kept walking after thinking about it all for 
		      a minute - as i contemplate it now it was like
		      the waldorf astoria...a minute ago having a grand
		      re-birth...i'd been there once upon a late night
		      frenzy...but i don't remember any stairs...not even 
		      much walking as yellow cabs did the work...miss
		      morin was at the chelsea hotel, i took a peek at 
		      how upscale 23rd street is now...i think it's where i 
		      bought that other mustang...i think it's still
		      there unlike music row on 48th...anyway, yes poets
		      are supposed to die like everyone else while
		      a few songs and verses live on but is it time
		      to advocate for protection of the scribes...
		      well, i dunno, but if someone whats to protect
		      me - please do but get Daria safe before that...
		       
		         
		       
		      3 aug 
		       
		       
		      not sure what to call this...an update? an
		      explanation...well whatever it is, the thing
		      is that last month i decided to make these
		      notes wait until the song was released, which
		      i expected to be a matter of days or a week...
		      there are several many dreams on the backlog...
		      but maybe this will help me make it all more
		      concise...still, i don't want anyone thinking
		      that i have been putting the dreamweaver page
		      on the backburner...on the offchance that
		      new visitors arrive or that i have upset
		      followers, i am put-placing the earlier notes
		      back in some sort of extra html box...meanwhile,
		      i still expect the track to be released any minute
		      now...i am reading charlotte bronte's villete,
		      i had more of a party than i expected with charles
		      bukowski's hollywood...nearly as lavish as pulp,
		      now i am in the middle of a cheesy slasher ride
		      called graduation day - this after viewing
		      red sun and wondering who would find the sword
		      left hanging there on the train wires...i think
		      i have entered into the veritas guitar giveaway
		      and i will be beside myself if i happen to win -
		      hmm i was thinking about love letters from a portuguese
		      nun as i wondered why it had such an impact on me...i couldn't
		      figure it out, as i looked at it again everyone seemed
		      to differ from my recollection but i saw why or partly
		      why kia attracted me...there is a similarity between
		      her and susan hemingway...it was then that robyn disappeared
		      and i viewed ballerina which i felt was too much into
		      developing the backstory and training only to be clumsy
		      but it came through in the end with some help from
		      keanu and a flamethrower...being maria was extremely
		      hard to get through, as i think highly of LTIP yet
		      this never gives you a way to care for ms schneider - 
		      the element of spoiled brat never leaves...despite
		      the stories, she and brando remained friends although
		      it is true that the same cannot be said for bertolucci -
		      you see there is no way to win, obviously i can't dismiss
		      a woman's suffering but i cannot badmouth bertolucci as
		      the only director that ever mailed me directly as if 
		      i were on his level...well, some situations have no
		      distinct resolution...let's see i also took a look at
		      meghan 2.0 but the wonder of the first has worn off in 
		      this sequel - didn't they see the fabulous potential
		      of the opening story with an ai model gone beserk...
		      dude, that was the movie and then end it with the 
		      promise of meghan being re-built for a third film...well,
		      it didnt leave a bad taste yet mostly that's the way i
		      saw it...like they threw everything at the audience hoping
		      something would stick...finally, cold sweat was all right
		      but here too they purposely posed the little girl to 
		      give men upskirt panty shots...no reason at all unless there 
		      is something about bastille day they haven't told me...
		      yeah, dream notes will return when the song is out. 
		       
				   
				  9 august 2025
		     the fifth of july was released on the eighth of august, i was
				  immersed in establishing a balance in terms of of music
				  software that is to say uninstalling this and installing
				  that...mostly this involved native instruments...it felt
				  as if had been suddenly rewarded for my efforts which 
				  was an all nighter that went past noon given that the
				  second laptop requested an update that was slow and 
				  resulted in me foolishly deleting the onedrive documents
				  folder which turned out to be the actual and only document
				  container...it wasnt in the live trash to restore and it
				  seems to have took the restore points too...so there was
				  the matter to checklist the missing things and get as many 
				  back as possible except i don't know what was there exactly
				  or why it took up so much space since i only use that for music -
				  reminds me to double check if anything else needs to be put placed
				  therein again...in any case, i felt good and sensed it as a turning
				  point although part of me wished to go back to typewriters
				  and tape recorders...in my dream there was some sort of 
				  discussion, could some beds be countries...the other afternoon
				  i awoke to a vision of a chinese letter or note which dissolved
				  into dots as if translated morse code...i say it is a vision since
				  it was there at the moment i awoke and vanished while i got up -
				  daria returned from sicily and wore a revealing red dress, i was
				  pretty surprised when she said she was switching schools as she
				  counted her shoes...i freaked out over julia presenting her
				  neighbor as a best friend while worried that it would in turn
				  give my own next door upstairs or downstairs an entrance...
				  ironically i have never felt so attracted to the other julia...
				  well lets get irony out of the way - lotta said she broke up
				  with someone that she had gone to mallorca and taken home...
				  i hesitate to spell out my suspicion that is was her manager,
				  but it is only logical to consider being that she specificied
				  him as a companion during her first trip to france...i sensed
				  it then but there may be more to the story than meets the eye
				  and it is nobody's business, i only mention it in passing to 
				  show myself how foolish i can still be...but what will i do
				  with these feelings and these memorized imprints within the
				  mind's eye...germany suspends military aid to israel...alaska
				  takes center stage...i realize that having a lot of guitars
				  also brings the dilemma of which one to play...agency heads
				  perish, stella then william, for a minute, as i glanced at
				  writings and songs i thought to myself i've overdone it, i've
				  taken on too much...yet it is an age of excess, is it not? 
				  i'm nearing chapter twenty of villette and i like it thus
				  far - i started to view harvest yet i realized that i was too
				  distracted and tired and hopefully can give it the attention it
				  deserves today...i'm happy to return here for these erratic
				  notes and i have a hell of ghost story for you next time...
				   
				   
				  18/08
				   
				   
				  i do not feel myself to be a stranger to ghosts...at least
				  not in dreams...i have felt their visits like angels on
				  parole from heaven's jail...here you go, take a few minutes
				  for the living...ever since i started writing i thought of
				  the words are we dead that live to tell, i thought also of
				  fame is the sun that shines on the dead, well i thought of
				  many things but these in relation to that...in any case, 
				  it's nothing i can prove, what proof is there within the
				  unconsciousness...only the shadows within memory...in the
				  case of my uncle, i would amend the statement to be from
				  hell's confines or perhpas via purgatory's expiation, do
				  a good deed and we'll let you go home, as it were...
				  i don't think the church kept that middle ground it's
				  weird that it comes to mind on the heels of the hand of dante,
				  who ofcourse included it in his divine comedy - 
				  where was i well i was stopped thrice at returning here,
				  first the subject matter - in this occasion it wasnt a
				  member of the family, it was someone i employed...i saw
				  him for the last time on the street, circa 108 or 109
				  broadway, he remarked about my countenance as if surprised,
				  i didn't know what to say and said it was plastic surgery -
				  in fact thinking of Elvis who i had heard say to get it
				  early so it wouldnt have to be so drastic et cetera...
				  listening to undescribably blue a dozen times yesterday
				  after the anniversary of his death...he'd gotten a bit
				  crude in a car as the documentary rolled, i think now,
				  so somehow this all fits together as in the dream it was
				  a car, the centerpiece was a car - unlike my dream last
				  night of leah telling me we were friends and then awaking 
				  to think it was bentley whi i had suggested be considered
				  to play sinead although she is neither an actor or singer
				  yet you can't look at her and not see the resemblance
				  once it's pointed out...in that dream i think he pointed at
				  the car, i was with a girl, not sure who - he was with another,
				  i put my girl in the back seat and got in the front seat - 
				  then he got into the driver's seat with his girl sort of upon him
				  but they kept shifting and sexually so until he ejaculated on 
				  her face yet all the while looking at me in the end with 
				  some sort of cruel satisfaction i could not understand as i
				  awoke...a precise memory of something he had told me led me
				  to believe that it was a ghost, no imagination or product of
				  mind, miller and aspirin, this was his recipe to last longer
				  during intercourse...you load up on miller high life beer
				  and get a couple of aspirin...subsequently i wondered if
				  ghosts actually had sex in the afterlife, they never really
				  frighten me and this was no different in that sense but it 
				  sure was intense and i sort of wish i knew what it meant...
				  i thought about it briefly again while watching the very
				  strange the night always comes...mazda madness...eddington
				  shows us the madness created at the start of the pandemic -
				  i recalled my argument that there was no logic to it, 
				  like prohibiting driving so there'd be no accidents...
				  because even walking one might stumble and fall...
				  ah yes, i was shocked to see walk hard the dewey cox
				  story...but i will refrain from commentizing upon it -
				  as i will remain silent on harvest, which is in a class
				  of its own. now then, or secondly, i was stopped by the
				  awful feeling of the delay fact...my spirits, high in
				  expectation of a haul that should have been arriving,
				  were brought down low as the package was sent out a week
				  later than i thought...so all that won't be here until
				  next week...look at my very own first world problem!
				  and finally well thirdly, i was stopped by the insight
				  in a passage within villete, i imagine very few people
				  will comprehend but it contains a severe truth and
				  that along with the fact that the novel might have
				  peaked in the middle gave me pause; yes i know it
				  is a long passage, but i must put-place it here
				  so as to have it available...
				  from chapter 24;
				  "Those who live in retirement, whose lives have fallen amid the seclusion of schools 
				  or of other walled-in and guarded dwellings, are liable to be suddenly and for a long 
				  while dropped out of the memory of their friends, the denizens of a freer world. 
				  Unaccountably, perhaps, and close upon some space of unusually frequent intercourse⁠—some 
				  congeries of rather exciting little circumstances, whose natural sequel would rather seem
				  to be the quickening than the suspension of communication⁠—there falls a stilly pause,
				  a wordless silence, a long blank of oblivion. Unbroken always is this blank; alike entire
				  and unexplained. The letter, the message once frequent, are cut off; the visit, formerly
				  periodical, ceases to occur; the book, paper, or other token that indicated remembrance, comes no more.

Always there are excellent reasons for these lapses, if the hermit but knew them. Though he is stagnant in his 
				  cell, his connections without are whirling in the very vortex of life. That void interval 
				  which passes for him so slowly that the very clocks seem at a stand, and the wingless hours 
				  plod by in the likeness of tired tramps prone to rest at milestones⁠—that same interval, 
				  perhaps, teems with events, and pants with hurry for his friends.

The hermit⁠—if he be a sensible hermit⁠—will swallow his own thoughts, and lock up his own emotions during these
				  weeks of inward winter. He will know that Destiny designed him to imitate, on occasion, the 
				  dormouse, and he will be conformable: make a tidy ball of himself, creep into a hole of life’s
				  wall, and submit decently to the drift which blows in and soon blocks him up, preserving him in ice for the season.

Let him say, “It is quite right: it ought to be so, since so it is.” And, perhaps, one day his snow-sepulchre will open,
				  spring’s softness will return, the sun and south-wind will reach him; the budding of hedges, 
				  and carolling of birds, and singing of liberated streams, will call him to kindly resurrection.
				  Perhaps this may be the case, perhaps not: the frost may get into his heart and never thaw more; 
				  when spring comes, a crow or a pie may pick out of the wall only his dormouse-bones. Well,
				  even in that case, all will be right: it is to be supposed he knew from the first he was mortal, 
				  and must one day go the way of all flesh, “As well soon as syne.”

Following that eventful evening at the theatre, came for me seven weeks as bare as seven sheets of blank paper: 
				  no word was written on one of them; not a visit, not a token.

About the middle of that time I entertained fancies that something had happened to my friends at La Terrasse. 
				  The mid-blank is always a beclouded point for the solitary: his nerves ache with the strain of long expectancy; 
				  the doubts hitherto repelled gather now to a mass and⁠—strong in accumulation⁠—roll back upon him with a force
				  which savours of vindictiveness. Night, too, becomes an unkindly time, and sleep and his nature cannot agree:
				  strange starts and struggles harass his couch; the sinister band of bad dreams, with horror of calamity,
				  and sick dread of entire desertion at their head, join the league against him. Poor wretch! 
				  He does his best to bear up, but he is a poor, pallid, wasting wretch, despite that best."

				  well, yes these are the lyrics to nobody knows you when you're down and out - 
				  which is possibly a point charlotte missed...but there were no blues back then...
				  still, to think she could - by turning her character into a man with poetic
				  intersections describing a solitary existence - conjure those emotions
				  by put-placing seven weeks as the timeline...herself, always surrounded
				  by others and eventually even married, was not intimate with loneliness
				  in the sense of lacking company...still, like the words in i'm just a
				  gigolo, there's something to it, you might agree...i certainly do, having
				  spent much more time than seven weeks without companionship...my point is
				  then what would she pen if she imagined it to be seven months, or years...
				  in my dream helena is in an involved conversation...i'm hearing her yet
				  i am not sure if i am there with her or not...the only way i can describe
				  it is to say i had no peripheral vision, my eyes were locked in looking
				  ahead into nothing specific or a specific nothingness...an abstraction -
				  she was speaking of legacy as if a time travel spy, for a minute i thought
				  it was to let me know what would become of my writing but i was either
				  too horny or more likely sure that it would be just like it should and
				  didn't want a fortune teller as it were...i should interrupt myself
				  and interject briefly on how once in a while women will contact me
				  -usually to join a dating site, or more frequently with a provocative photo
				  and a note stating how they need or want this or that in random succession,
				  spam as it were that i barely glance of or take notice, less frequently
				  it is an actual letter with convoluted details form european women
				  intent on what they call a serious relationship, then there are a few
				  requests to chat...since these are few i do answer as i sometimes politely
				  turn down the others...early in the month a woman named mary started to message.
				  it was, to my surprise, nearly normal with none of the usual weirdness that
				  i have pointed to here - of course this was balanced by her wanting me
				  to invest in future trading...still it all felt friendly and maybe well
				  intentioned until i noticed her reluctance to be 'seen' in terms of
				  me posting her picture...and when her voice didnt match her features, 
				  she claimed she had lived overseas when young and so on and so forth -
				  well i suppose i will never know as she then disappeared for a while
				  only to return for a final confrontation in which she turned logic on 
				  its very head by deleting the thread and calling me an extreme pervert!
				  a good title for something i suppose, now i don't know what she meant
				  but i am positive she was hiding something...i was talking about hair
				  styles and shaved heads...still it brought the lonesome side of things
				  into focus...so i'm saying to myself, am i even able to have a conversation
				  with someone else...can i even afford a friend...but worse, and i don't
				  like to admit it, is it now so settled in me, this luxury this freedom
				  of being by myself that i cannot in a sense share in terms of companionship.
				  i seem to be able to do so with my cat and my guitars yet i don't know. 
				  my one concern is that by divulging or declassifying such notions, is
				  that it will sound as if a protest. it ain't, it's merely a fact with
				  a bit of an opinion that is maybe grounding its roots or being pulled
				  from its place to be replanted on more solid land. 
				   
				   
				  twenty august 
				   
				   
				  on of the last times i turned on my television was to gawk
				  at would be the next to last mission impossible film - gee
				  that was an awful good time...so i had some expectations
				  with the conclusion of this series...after setting up the
				  sony, i settled in to it...however i found i had no way 
				  of pausing due to the cable remote being for functions
				  unralted to the usb drive and the natural remote itself
				  unresponsive to new batteries and slaps...already it was
				  a mission in itself as i then downloaded andraid apps
				  that all failed since lacking the ir blaster as they 
				  call it...giving up an turning to one of the laptops,
				  i found a much clearer picture, at least...but i was a
				  bit distracted given the aforementioned runaround - 
				  and then the underwater scenes battled with james 
				  bond scenes in memory as did the high flying sequences
				  near the end find themselves contrasted with hell's angels -
				  i mean i knew i was looking at very rare and special cinema
				  history but films for me an experience that require a
				  preset disposition, that is to say simply the agreement
				  within one;s self to go watch a movie...in fact my idea
				  was the opposite as i wanted to finish up villette, yet
				  sensing opportunity well...let us say i did not like it
				  as much as the other one yet there is no doubt that it
				  is awe inspiring. it also bitter sweet, as nothing in
				  production will wield such raw power for an incredible
				  cross section of people...in any casem does one buy a 
				  new remote or overhaul the equipment entirely...
				  in my dream, i am sitting with some girls, it is a restaurant,
				  a rare dream for me...but i am sitting there like a thief
				  planning on how to carry all the things i plan to steal...
				  i got up at midnight, feeling weird over it and not even
				  sure where it was or who they were...in the mary timeline,
				  i will have you know, there was another catfish, i say this
				  now certain of who the actual woman in the photo is...
				  someone named rose, who must be insane or intent on making
				  me feel as if crazed...no need to extend the story as it
				  might serve itself better in terms of fiction...no way it
				  could be poetry...i went to sleep for a few more hours
				  hoping i would catch my new contact in hong kong before 
				  nightfall...you know, the twelve hour time zone difference -
				  speaking of hours, i'm only a few away from concluding
				  villette, at dawn i cooked rice and made the chicken
				  peppery with onion, lime, and olive oil. the meal brought
				  a drowsy sensation i fought off not wanting to spoil 
				  the gains i made in terms of my desired schedule.
				  i hesitated through coffee and cigarettes yet jotted
				  these words hoping to get even more done in the sense
				  of recording or mixing music for production.

				  THE SUMMER WITHOUT POETRY
				   
				   
				  nothing beats a jet two holiday
				  echo until the eagle has landed
				  revved up crowds with sydney jeans
				  when her sammy davis movie wrapped
				  we can look back at the irony later
				  antlers and moose meat alaska
				  summit sees leaders greet
				  night witch spirit
				  polina gelman
				  i filter it through awake

				  six thousand words added

				  the heat it even stinks

				  the heatwave hits my ass as i sit -
				  a donkey packed with a bomb booms

				  it's too much kamchatka nasa looks

				  lamenting the once upon time innocent
				  and nearly universal word, brooke's 
				  husband sells pizza, hell, she even got
				  a slice tattoo on her arm...simultaneously
				  i finally understand the term catfishing -
				  i know i should prolly not speak into the
				  unknown yet something within requires
				  interaction - except in my dream i am
				  packing up, not from the plantation but
				  aunt's gone old house, i clearly see
				  my plaid pierre cardin cotton robe and
				  grab it heading down the stairs only
				  to find two chained dogs fiercely barking
				  on the right side and then a solitary puppy
				  perhaps like winnie hey leah didnt say if
				  it was marymount my old school except with
				  one eye closed or missing itself in a fright
				  myself estimating the space to slip through
				  this canine puzzle, but i awake before i can
				  make sense of it all - it's marie anne's 
				  day, a lot of this happened last month yet
				  a lot of it is still going on...i told julia
				  that i loved her for saying she would rather 
				  suck the toes of a man that hadn't washed 
				  his feet in ahundred days than watch some
				  summer i turned pretty scene...conrad murray
				  was the michael jackson doctor, i come
				  across the five's abc...there was nothing
				  like it until hanson's mmmbop, i'm at all
				  the bebop scales on my shirley flying v -
				  still an inertia zen settles in as if 
				  we were all meant to doom scroll for free,
				  well maybe it is freedom, liberty herself
				  went to denmark after returning from saint
				  tropez from denmark itself via england...
				  i feel i have known amaryllis without meeting
				  her and in amarillo burl 'bj' jackson chester
				  died possibly from team conrad syndrome -
				  i've been riffing on get behind the mule
				  and killed it yesterday...white stratocaster
				  that gave me hell, go ahead brag, go ahead rave...
				  now i don't think ozzy osbourne is going to 
				  be nominated or made a saint, despite what
				  lucy snow thinks about the catholic church, 
				  i tell mother protestantism is in the blood,
				  but i didn't say anything about him and sort of want to
				  sort it out here and now as a conclusion to
				  prose-poem shock news shavings, there was a 
				  minute wherein nothing else was on, a final
				  concert that really was saintly and an army
				  of guitarists picking on momma i'm coming home,
				  someone postulated that it was a zeitgeist!
				  myself, i was puzzled. i thought of the scene
				  wherein he pissed by the pool and dropped down
				  to lick the tiles, this ain't saying i didn't
				  like the man - i did, i only felt that the hype
				  was indeed somehow out of tune...too much or
				  not enough? i can't say, it's the emotion i 
				  suppose that one might encounter if most of 
				  us looked the other way while the war pigs 
				  went about their business, by the way, it's
				  a protest song in the folk sense...now you 
				  might ask what i think it should have been
				  like or expected...i reckon something more
				  underground, something in keeping with his
				  persona or style...who the fuck is justin 
				  bieber, the wynn hotel is asking...yeah, something
				  that didnt parade in a procession so heavy
				  that it hardly left a trace...or did everyone
				  hail satan as if not knowing shit about fuck...
				  have i got too vulgar, good he would have enjoyed
				  that, a twenty something couple having condomed
				  sex decide to go for a get pregnant try and proceed
				  to turn the rubber inside out after ejaculation
				  as the romp continues or perhaps it was Jesus 
				  gone insane from prayers
				  to john michael osbourne, rest in metal.
				  meanwhile we have not found cile steward, 
				  her mother, with the strength of God, voiced
				  her sorrow in a solemn attempt to make the 
				  world safer for other children in the future...
				  i dedicate whatever this might be to cece,
				  i demand that senate bill one be put into action...
				  i decline the silence for now and so have here said...
				  (for a second there i wish i had been the candy man
				  instead, separating the sorrow and collecting
				  all the cream, of course that entertainer was a card carrying 
				  member of the church of satan, not the deranged
				  seeing eye bitch hound in everything is illuminated)
				   
				   
				  23 august 2025
				   
				  i came to the end of villette and therein knew
				  i was right, the quoted passage was the peak,
				  in a sense, it foreshadows the possibly solitary
				  life to come after the sails encountered a storm...
				  i awoke very early - too early - i knew i had
				  not rested although surely i had slept a few 
				  hours...only a few, i always think of soraya on
				  this date...i raced through some likes on her
				  instagram as if to say hey - i didn;t really
				  enjoy f-1 the movie...i even thought, no wonder
				  apple tv is raising its price, the soundtrack alone
				  must have cost a fortune...and yet it fades out
				  with a mediocre ed sheerhan tune...let me not argue
				  about it - obviously some people like his thing...
				  my point is the shifting perspective used to film
				  the laps did not make sense to me...i also did not
				  like ferrari, but for contrast you can feel the 
				  quality is higher especially in the stranger killing
				  crash scene...anyway, we are behind the car, then 
				  in front of the car, but also sometimes on the side
				  of it...dizzying and if like me you are not a fan
				  of the sport - well...it makes it a struggle...
				  i regret to report, as i searched for what to 
				  read next, leaning into the tenant of wildfell hall,
				  so as to have experienced all three of the bronte 
				  sister's writing albeit i believe wuthering heights
				  to be the bee's knees, i thought of london rules,
				  which i excitedly read in vigil for the arrival of
				  a new season of slow horses...i thought if charlotte
				  were writing today this would be her type of romp,
				  hmm perhaps without the political commentary, herron
				  goes out of his way to have a giggle at trump's expense,
				  but there is hardly a mention of leaders in villette,
				  well napoleon as a point of reference or description...
				  in any case i have decided what to read next, although
				  i am most likely going to view einee meniee...in my
				  dream i was in the lobby of where i used to live
				  once upon a time, about to check the mail, i looked
				  at the key, it now had to be slid in sideways, as
				  opposed to straight in...as if to reflect my thoughts
				  before going to sleep - people i don't especially like
				  showed up - i awoke weirded out - who knows why this
				  happens and who knows why my thoughts turn to women 
				  once in recent while as if camping 
				  i am certain want nothing to do with me...like is it 
				  a message, or is it merely a mess? i scrambled eggs
				  and then started the day again near noon...it's 
				  an unusal day as did dishes and even cooked again,
				  yet i am waiting a while before settling into the
				  meal. oh yeah and the movie...
				   
				   
				  24/8/2025
				   
				  so the movie, not terribly good, had, i felt, car
				  sequences that somehow surpassed the F-1 scenes...
				  still, i can only imagine they made that thinking
				  it would be some sort of shocking treat but the 
				  sad part is none of it stands the test of time,
				  (someone asked chatgpt to count to a million)
				  and i am writing this mere hours after watching it!
				  sure i remember and can recall it, but not in the
				  sweet way that happens when cinema rises to its
				  potential without gimmicks...(the ai refused,
				  several times) i want to express my admiration
				  for brad pitt so my previous thoughts are not
				  taken as a stance against him...this was jack
				  conrad, after all, not to mention being the
				  producer of mickey 17, anyway let's hang our
				  hopes on cliff booth...both my dreams were 
				  weird, i finally sort of met another gemma, 
				  well a third if we are counting ward, and
				  she, not the heir or the model, were in my
				  dream yet in some vague fashion i cannot pinpoint -
				  it crawled through the day, i remember standing in
				  the shower thinking, i am in arizona and nevada
				  and london somehow...helena called her chickens
				  baby dinosaurs...i was dealing with some other
				  woman in my dream, she was handing me paperwork
				  that needed to be filled out but then some disgruntled
				  man switched places with her and i stood at the counter
				  trying to ask about the last two forms...there were
				  paragraph length questions, i wanted to know where i 
				  was supposed to write the answers...i suppose this
				  was an improvement on the baffling situation with 
				  savannah...i liked her, i think she didnt like me
				  yet overwhelmed thought's vision as if it had all been
				  reversed within me - which might help to explain part
				  of yesterday;s note...it was getting hot as i awoke
				  today, there in the sauna type humid chamber which i 
				  cannot fathom since i long ago covered the windows
				  against the sun...so middle night get up feeling a
				  severe twist at left calf like a sprain or swimming
				  cramp...i sit up and it;s gone, i lay back down but
				  no longer feel like staying in bed possibly sensing
				  the mysteriously burning miasma...it's sunday, there
				  was a song being wroted in my head or at least the
				  repeated refrain of it insisting...years ago i wroted
				  'we are your limousine salesmen' it reminds me of that
				  of course someone removed those pages from songbook
				  as if now reflected in waking minutes - emily ann
				  roberts, i find, had to get her martin and video
				  letter the tune she was thinking of...flight to 
				  wisconsin...madison's a nice place, not as nice as
				  madison avenue yet that is to be expected, no surprise,
				  sunrise yet a few hours away as i speak to someone
				  in hong kong, maybe victoria; name of land, 
				  ceded to England by China in 1842, from the Chinese 
				  hiang kiang, meaning good water; after the english queen.
                  even in such a faraway, at such distances, i encounter
				  the sensation of posers intent on masking themselves
				  for the sabotage, making the entity in mission impossible
				  more likely than i would care to admit - is it others
				  i do not trust or myself...there is no answer, in the
				  proximity a headlighted car stands still at the corner
				  as if deciding which way to turn at these crossroads -
				  i catch a glimpse as i look out the window to question
				  the delay in my request for breeze - the weather is
				  getting cooler but it will never be winter here. 
				  Lucy, in the novel, is the only Snow i will encounter
				  for now.
				   
				   
				  26 august 
				   
				  couldn't find a way to record correctly with video,
				  until i did, but my project idea is going to take
				  longer as now doing it twice means double the work
				  in terms of editing...oh yeah, i am simply trying
				  to get a few versions together for something...
				  it's tuesday at two in the morning - on monday i 
				  dreamt i was with julia - she was also in a magazine,
				  the magazine was rolled with a viriddescent tint as
				  if stained by grass on dream lawn...i can't say why
				  there is such ease with some people in these scenes,
				  like her...still i was looking at the magazine more
				  so than at her...when i awoke i found liberty had
				  visited a magazine shop...i didnt see liroe - 
				  i used the mustang and the kramer all in the same
				  reel - one take has a good enough sound and the
				  other has a nice enough angle, putting these together
				  is a task that worries me, so i have been putting it off -
				  i went to sleep early and awoke too soon for my taste -
				  i had been dreaming of emilee, maybe because i kept the
				  portrait up on my wall and it is partly visible in the
				  video, or maybe for no specific reason at all - it was
				  not our life, at least not one that either of us imagined;
				  we were living on a farm, in a farm house, and she asked me
				  to get her something yet as i went out i realized that i
				  had left my keys, it seems that in the dream knocking on 
				  the door was not an option - i had what she wanted and 
				  was surrounded by birds - i think now of how most birds 
				  are natural cannibals - in any case the bizarre part was
				  how the idea of living with her felt memorized, ritualized,
				  as if a fact in memory although recently i have only thought
				  of her at the sight of willow hand, i wake up with the 
				  heat strangling me, jump in the shower thinking of
				  romy mars, she had lightly pranked her roommate in a
				  lockout situation, as for the rest of the situation;
				  i survived the struggle to watch electrick children -
				  maybe i was rewatching it, can;t exactly count all the
				  movies i;ve seen...so i either liked it better this time
				  or i enjoyed it for the first time...hanging on the telephone
				  is as catchy as ego...still haven't selected what book to 
				  look into next...on a whim, i viewed the assignment, which
				  i know for certain i did see long ago but had no detailed
				  memory of - it's not an easy one to look at and perhaps 
				  more so now in the middle of mourning donald southerland -
				  i had lost track of aidan circa practical magic or more
				  likely songcatcher - good to see he has been constantly
				  at work with five projects upcoming and one series...
				  making my production concerns feel trivial...hate to 
				  see lars von trier's name kicked around the obituary
				  circuit, it was per holst and i suppose to attract 
				  more readers the press made the connection...my
				  point is the man has enough trouble without having
				  to now navigate against the casual curse of
				  words in print which might have made some people
				  think it was his headline instead of the producer. 
				  "The old cathedrals often have sublime artworks
				  hidden away in the darkest corners for only God to see. 
				  The same goes for murder..." 
				   
				   
				  28/8
				   
				  not much in terms of dreams...i chalk it up to 
				  overthinking...that film led me on to want to 
				  fiddle through a spy thriller...i selected the
				  fourth protocol, in an audio book i think is
				  an abridged version - i also think there is 
				  a film adaptation...in any case, it is pretty 
				  good...got halfway into it and didn't want to
				  to stop...i cannot say the same for mobland -
				  which i lined up to view then weighed the 
				  things to do...hopefully i can see that
				  down the line...i did take a moment to view
				  the deceiver which holds up shockingly well -
				  i don't mind nudity in cinema but i love it
				  when it could have obviously been used yet
				  isn't...like it implies a certain respect 
				  for the actors, specifically the actress -
				  (the lead plays a prostitute, you see_
				  well, as for my own video project, i have now
				  neared the finish line...if all goes well i 
				  can count it as a completion by tomorrow...
				  it took more work than i expected but i 
				  suppose that is the nature of it...
				  i am going ahead with the ending although
				  there was something in the box still in transit
				  that i wanted to employ therein...the last i 
				  heard it should arrive this weekend and be 
				  delivered some days after that...september.
				  the thought saddens me yet it is not such
				  a serious sorrow - i mean the haul will 
				  positively improve my spirits. she rides
				  shotgun thrilled me with its well paced
				  and mysterious start then further as it
				  took its twists and turns...indeed, one
				  i might not hesitate to watch again...
				  lovely surprise. ps, writer tries to 
				  order chinese food, they respond, we 
				  are out of fried rice, baffled - he 
				  settles for a sandwich...the next day
				  he tries again...we took beef fried
				  rice off the menu but you can order the
				  mixed fried rice with only beef...i 
				  ordered it...still baffled and maybe
				  even more now in writing it as the 
				  frivolity prevails over logic and i 
				  think it doesn't even make a good story!
				  my apologies for put-placing such 
				  a jigsaw puzzle in your hands, hopefully
				  i will make it up to you with some other
				  tidbit which requires no guessing
				  in the coming month.  
				   
				   
				  two september
				   
				   
				  having finished my attempts at recording
				  nine versions of get behind the mule,
				  live and on video, with even a couple of 
				  takes i like very much, i turned down
				  two german films which were - well - they
				  were feeling out of place - and went 
				  straight into mobland...i actually could
				  not stop watching it, i kept thinking this
				  should have been two movies, maybe three -
				  so i watched it all except for the last
				  half hour to have the pleasure of waking
				  up to it as a sort of conclusion. so happy,
				  i went down that road. in my dreams i saw
				  pigeons on a city street - my thoughts 
				  convoluted and quick - i had started reading
				  the tenant of wildfell hall and maybe i was
				  trying to hard to process the information -
				  i don't think i've dreamt of rock doves
				  previously - i also don't think i have posted
				  a series without any notes...there was some 
				  sort of glitch and i had to re-post it and
				  so continued posting all nine without notes -
				  i suppose it's obvious but i had promised 
				  willow hand (who is featured in the eighth
				  version - actually the first one i taped
				  which served like a catalyst - cause i 
				  was tickled by her picture with a donkey -
				  near enough to a mule, i thought...
				  when a donkey gets it on with a mare;
				  mules are produced...or so i am told)
				  a credit in the form of mentioning it was
				  her...well, at least i am making it clear
				  here and might edit maybe or commentize it...
				  in my back to bed dream this morning i found
				  my cat was golden on one side and there was
				  another cat seemingly excited, feline erection
				  dream on keanu reeves' birthday...i had been
				  thinking of helena who said her cat is willy
				  and made an amazing road car video which 
				  made me think of amanda seyfried...you'll
				  know the refernce if you've seen twin peaks
				  the return...for some reason i was very excited
				  to hear that chloe grace moretz had tied the
				  proverbial knot...there was a pale blue dress
				  and i loved seeing her joy in it...
				  however my yesterday still went weird as i 
				  didn't get to new recordings, not even to 
				  guitar ritual...it was like i was overwhelmed
				  by my own thoughts in the whirlwind puzzle of
				  procrastination or more likely too much talk.
				   
				   
				  later that evening 
				   
				   
				  i suppose it is what i would call the variation
				  sessions...i was at ease with the song since
				  doing it daily as an improvisation...of course
				  once one hits the record button, with the knowledge
				  that it all has to be done in one take...well, let
				  us say most of them were not first takes, all the first
				  takes served to figure out the style (except for an 
				  unfilmed one wherein i wasn't thinking about it in
				  those terms - only to get a feel or confirm that i
				  was hearing myself right...)all i knew
				  was that there should be some difference between
				  each...the heat and humidity didn't help and i 
				  admit to some surprise at the end of each completion -
				  i am inclined to say i like the fifth version a bit
				  more than the others...for now...before that, as
				  i tried to recapture the planned progression in 
				  open F tuning on the martin acoustic, the high e string 
				  snapped - i mention this because later with ibanez
				  electric (in open G) the situation repeated itself...
				  i realized later that these two had become connected
				  in ways i didn't imagine, they were used to being
				  the only ones i used...and suddenly surrounded by
				  the new models it seems they collaborated to mirror
				  each other's protest...it led me to rearrange how
				  i kept them and put placed them together hoping that
				  it would help in the future...still, it underlines
				  the struggle of having several guitars as any of 
				  the axes might at one time or another feel neglected...
				  it's nothing i expected...like the new naked gun...
				  what a riot! it was beyond silly right down to the 
				  creadts, you don't need glasses! well, i do need
				  guesses about the two dreams i had, again in 3k,
				  therein at the living room - both times with an
				  ex girlfriend and her sister - once her memory 
				  flooded my thoughts but not the other...the way
				  to describe it would be sensible...we spoke calmly,
				  lovingly maybe, and in hushed tones - i can't say 
				  more because the content of the conversations 
				  drifted away leaving only the hint of itself. my 
				  only concern was that i sensed no emotional shift
				  within myself over them as if they were interchangeable -
				  i hope they are all right and wish them well -
				  after calculating and contrasting the price of pizza
				  and cake, i opted for cake and said thing arrived an
				  hour or so ago...i had some and shaved. anyway, the songs
				  were all recorded live during the period of 26 august
				  until 29 august with the exception of the one not filmed
				  from 20 august but also done live in a single take -
				  which felt no stage fright worry over a possible audience...
				  the sun was in virgo and once in a while i felt bathed
				  in that light. 
				   
				   
				  4.9.2025
				   
				  the expected haul seems to have been re-delayed...they
				  said it would arrive friday, tomorrow, but that implies
				  another week's wait since those things need to be sorted,
				  put on trucks, and so on and so forth...
				  i was partly alarmed by the witch's torment as it held
				  an interesting concept yet insisted on playing out as
				  if it couldn't have been done in an hour or less -
				  for me, that meant skipping through it to its uneventful
				  ending...there was indeed more drama in the windows 
				  update...i'd seen the reports and noticed all the wild
				  discounts which in retrospect feel as if a planned revolution
				  to switch as much equipment as possible - with some hesitation
				  i went ahead and updated, confident in my snapdragon but
				  once the package downloaded the machine returned with that
				  message; ran into a problem and needs to restart...it said
				  they would restart it but i got jittery after some minutes
				  and pressed down on the power button feeling all the madness
				  that comes with possibly losing files one has even forgot
				  one had...as i waited i made a mental list of the novel
				  i thought was not backed up and the songs that only existed
				  therein, and who knows what else...funny huh, and i had just
				  started learning the chords to lennon's i'm losing you -
				  also therein shocked by the line "So what the hell am I supposed to do?
                   Just put a bandaid on it? And stop the bleeding now..."
				  which needless to say brought to mind the tragic 1980 scene
				  and suddenly my own situation with the laptop...anyway,
				  all that did pass, it started up and i paused updates...
				  with a plan to connect one of my storage units and transfer
				  as much as possible in case of anything similar down the line.
				  he repeats that line, stop the bleeding now...i thought it
				  must have crossed his mind as he lay shot down...
				  meanwhile i wasn't bleeding but the sweat felt like losing
				  part of myself upon the bed - two hours of dreamless sleep
				  only to awake to the wonder of it all - returning to 
				  dream, i find myself dressed as i was except with shirt
				  unbuttoned and running around trying to fetch a pen and
				  respond to the door all at the same time...i'm standing
				  there as if waiting to sign something...there are two men
				  at the gate, they look as if one man that has grown a
				  second head on top of his natural skull...they are dark,
				  unfriendly, and i cannot recognize them...i wake up again
				  thankful that at least i had another hour of sleep - 
				  i recorded an instrumental song yesterday and no one
				  knocked upon my door - except for a meal delivery -
				  the day was cooler yet the apartment kept it;s steamy
				  stance...i thought about helena's voice message before
				  going to sleep...i think it is incorrect to leave school
				  in order to be more of a fashion model...but that is
				  only a suspicion as i have no insight...when i got up 
				  it was eight thirty i didn't have any dream recall. 
				   
				   
				  five september 
				   
				   
				  my point was that she could exploit herself in 
				  terms of becoming a social media influencer slash
				  model instead of paying an agency to exploit her
				  by passing her portfolio along for adverts...
				  the education part is debatable...
				  i watched dynamite, a film i had superimposed 
				  in part - the party scene - upon one of the get
				  behind the mule takes...it was way more intense
				  than i could have imagined...but as a sort of 
				  spoiler warning, skip this one if you are a 
				  bird lover...julia faye was in it like she was
				  in a lot of cecil b demille films...i didn't
				  make a movie yesterday, but julia mecey was
				  in my dream...we were sitting next to each other
				  at the frame of an open door, i felt dumb for
				  not knowing the architectual terminology of
				  a rounded door...it was very much like the 
				  door in rome when i met carmen from romania
				  and took her picture...suddenly marie anne
				  was sitting opposite us...none of us were 
				  speaking as if we understood one another
				  by simply being there - i woke up for a moment
				  then, i had been looking at her ring...studying
				  it to find a talk show host engraved on one side -
				  it must have been the middle of the night when
				  my next dream presented masha which is spelled
				  like mawa but is a nickname for maria, i say 
				  masha to distinguish from aria and neverova -
				  masha had been on my mind through the day as 
				  she reminds me of someone i can't place - or 
				  perhaps it is merely someone from a past life -
				  in the dream i am still audience and she is
				  decked out in heels and a cat print bikini -
				  she is swaying more than dancing but i can't
				  make sense of the dream and awake a bit baffled
				  like maybe this scene was intended for someone
				  else -it's still dark yet the day is coming
				  fast - i have some cake along with the coffee
				  and get in a chapter of the tenant of wildfell
				  hall...i steal away for a nap before the sun 
				  gets any higher into the sky - in the sugar
				  filled dreamscape i am on a sofa facing a tv
				  and there is a girl there with me...i brush away
				  remnants of clingy socks from her toes...like
				  always there is nothing on the tv, i play with her
				  breast and try for one of the music stations - i
				  am surprised - it wasn't like before as all the 
				  music channels are labeled by country yet no 
				  matter the nation there is an ozzy osbourne song
				  blasting out on each...i lower the volume and
				  realize three women from my family are arriving -
				  i guess it was lotta or sierra - i'm really not
				  sure as i have not televisioned since mother 
				  was here a year or so ago - she tells me to get
				  her my sister's phone number - i stand in front
				  of my sister in the dream and notice a spider web
				  tattoo on her right eyelid...she says she can't
				  remember that number number and vanishes while i
				  now face a closet of my onw clothes - sierra or
				  lotta says something about the spider web design -
				  i sense mother and aunt but i can't see them, then
				  start to doubt that it was my sister...it would 
				  necessarily take a larger face for that design,
				  maybe it was all a masquerade or the dream of
				  a couch potato somewhere - i don't know but i did
				  play i'm losing you again a couple of times and
				  even took a minute to feel the vocal, that is mine
				  in contrast to lennon...i suspect i will only have
				  trouble with the chorus which goes a bit against
				  the grain as if to plead lighter than the argumentative
				  verses in four syllables that sometimes sound like three -
				  not that i actually know how i will do it in the end,
				  but i wanted get learnt on how he did it.
				   
				   
				  six september 
				   
				   
				  someone is speaking to me in a dream, i do not
				  know or recognize who it might be...it seems we
				  are in a lobby or shop...something street-level
				  since after talking i find myself on the avenue...
				  i am shown pepperidge farm chessmen cookies - 
				  there is writing upon the package more like a 
				  letter or note than ingredients...i actually
				  have one in the pantry yet i had overdosed on
				  these sweets and it's been there a couple of months
				  now - the font is a light script - easy enough to 
				  read yet i don't recall what it said - upon waking
				  i find myself thinking of astrid, i had just learnt
				  she was in lisbon when the following day told of 
				  a streetcar all the press called a funicular for
				  some reason...she has two pictures are i admire -
				  i was relieved to see her post a new photo as it
				  then stood to reason that she was more or less in
				  safety - in the dream, i saunter and spot a man
				  i do recognize although i have not met him - i 
				  suppose he reminds me of the jamaican in the 
				  exchange loft with the slide out key as a transaction
				  counter - for some reason in the scene he is having a
				  sale, the dime bag comes with some sort of hallucinogenic
				  side-kick, twisted roots in licorish color resembling 
				  peppermint christmas candy sticks or canes in surreal
				  or abstract miniature and also encased within the 
				  common jewelry zip bag...i am eager and receive a
				  ten from my twenty disappointed at the nnumber of
				  visible seeds well at least they are visible and
				  not embedded into the bud like a surprise in a 
				  cracker jack box...i walk away and awake - it's
				  seven in the morning, i'm nearing the mid-way 
				  mark of the tenant of wildfell hall...i will
				  carry on with it as the start of my day, then 
				  mix the new recording i did yesterday before
				  guitar ritual when i again strummed through
				  the aforementioned song yet did not sing it
				  for the smoke filled room and upset stomach...
				  i had viewed unknown number the high school
				  catfish, which proves frailty thy name is
				  woman might yet hold ground, hail willy shakes -
				  and i reluctantly added it to the list of 
				  films about writers...what i disliked the 
				  most was how miss licari reminded me of miss
				  mcderby from grade school... who left me
				  a cherished remembrance...
				  ps, for reasons unexplained
				  i created wordstar.straw.page 
				   
				   
				  8.9.2025
				   
				   
				  in a dream i am strumming a guitar - 
				  sliding down from an a suspended chord
				  on the second fret to other chords
				  between the fifth and seventh...
				  the day did not seduce much activity,
				  i tried to watch something called
				  what we hide, but i was interrupted
				  by an amazon delivery - the driver
				  calling from another building down
				  the road and the call itself making
				  a passing street vendor sound in 
				  stereo - sounds really do sway
				  emotion or have the potential to 
				  do so...i left the movie, my state
				  of mind more to blame than the drama -
				  in another dream, a woman has moved in
				  and is being very gentle with me as if
				  intent on staying, i;m not sure who she 
				  is and she didn't remind me of anyone
				  after i awoke...i was telling her that 
				  i had cake and left over chinese food
				  and it was all in the fridge - of course
				  there hasnt really been left over take
				  out since hunan garden...i don't recall
				  exactly yet i believe the dream was not
				  in english...i keep seeing these laptops
				  on sale and started seriously considering
				  getting on...no easy choice...we all know
				  there will be new models in a few months -
				  what if they are merely clearing stock - 
				  i tested the items that arrived, everything
				  seemed fine - although i still feel marantz
				  owes me refund...before resloving itself -
				  anne switches narration to the female lead
				  and it's the very definition of open up 
				  the safe; bitches have a lot to say...
				  the writing isnt bad, although it gets
				  a bit too religious, but it is as if 
				  she is knitting and making her readers
				  explore the process of stitching her
				  protagonist's tale until one feels drunk 
				  or dizzy - i suppose that implies that
				  between charlotte and emily she was the
				  lesser scribe...of course one could equally
				  argue that it was a forerunner of psychological
				  novels...if she were here, i would put place it
				  thisaway; you missed all levity like a band
				  playing straight ballads for hours, very little
				  here inspires affection for any the characters
				  when the tempo is downright sour...a third of it
				  done, but i doubt there will be any humor on the
				  horizon...well as hunter thompson said; pay the
				  ticket, take the ride.

				  9.9.2025
				  <BR>
				  <BR>
				  i got up early, and returned myself to sleep,
				  thinking surely i did not get enough rest - 
				  caitlin, who left new york for los angeles
				  spoke of ovulation...it reminded of a slippery
				  dream i missed jotting, sitting in a bath with
				  a woman...i don't think it was her - and seeing
				  blood rise...then searching her to see if she
				  was bleeding...maybe it was about the blood moon -
				  term of eclipse...a good reason to be a thief
				  is to steal sky - now this is the third mention
				  of shotgun, which i find weird or interesting -
				  in another dream, there is a man in a trench 
				  coat, unlike the flood dream or the film - 
				  in fact sort of like kyle maclachlan, he is 
				  holding the weapon and looking none too happy.
				  i remember waking up and thinking of the other
				  side of dale cooper...gee he was good in that.
				  too good. as i drifted into dreams this mid-morning
				  i found myself dressed in a suit explaining to 
				  a man that i had a hankerchief, he tried to 
				  beat me by producing a second one from his lapel
				  pocket side...but i had one in my own and he turned
				  as if defeated, i patted him on the back...thinking
				  of keaton, neither buster nor dianne but michael -
				  although as confusing as it is, douglas...film 
				  idea the two michael douglases - back in the series
				  kyle also played a doug...it all comes around somehow -
				  anyway there is a line, crowded, it feels we are all
				  enetering a court house - a heavy set judge leans over
				  the entrance - there is a pretty prosecutor and she is 
				  trying to flirt with him, it is all in a language i 
				  can't understand - she tries again after glancing at
				  me, saying a word that sounds like mint - but he scoffs
				  as if correcting her, mont...i wake up thinking she
				  doesnt have a chance with her case. i suppose the 
				  only thing to do now is to listen to jackson browne's
				  lawyers in love along with queen's don't stop me now
				  for it being inka's birthday and it was through her
				  i found that song. 
				   
				   
				  ten september 
				   
				   
				  i'd gone to sleep thinking of julia...well two
				  julias...one had spoken of naps with a near 
				  political enthusiasm...the other i had seen
				  in weapons...a modern classic that defies
				  category and somehow transcends itself...
				  one of the few times where hype is not only
				  justified, but on some level even lacking. 
				  well, let me leave it there as i would be
				  tempted to go into spoilers by continuation -
				  all the while, yesterday and today, that is
				  i had been intent on avoiding the mention 
				  of the girl on the train that was unalived
				  as the post-modern expression now says -
				  but forgive me my lack of restraint as
				  i was nearing the point of perfect silence,
				  i mean why speak - what could one say!
				  i was confronted by reports of an even
				  more intense tragedy...she was stabbed
				  in the neck, he was shot in the neck!
				  orem, utah...charlottte, north carolina...
				  iryna was as quiet as mouse, but the silence
				  of the passangers near her was deafening...
				  i wasn't sure what shocked me more - anyway,
				  charlie was not quiet, on the contrary, 
				  he took a stance and it seems to have cost
				  his life...i was sure of the shock in his
				  case, as i watched the twitch and slump
				  of his being when the bullet struck flesh
				  and blood poured out into social media...
				  everything said or nothing to say - both
				  equalized by death...so i jot the note,
				  horrified for his wife and children...
				  hoping they never see my careless words. 
				  i should have been thinking about doris,
				  another birthday girl...but where was the time?
				  i had cake for breakfast along with honey don't -
				  two great films in row, yes it is possible - 
				  i had a complaint maybe a couple , but
				  hats off to ethan, that was fine cinema. 
				  i had expected to spend the afternoon
				  concerned with the girls visiting new york
				  for fashion week, at least the ones i 'knew' -
				  yet that breaking news left no room to escape -
				  nepal and france lost any hope for international
				  attention, nevermind gaza israel or poland
				  ukraine russia...i saw one woman say he 
				  was 'stabilized" then the reports confirmed
				  his passing...as of this writing, the shooter
				  is at large...another woman had posted herself
				  naked with her georgia state id exposed upon
				  her belly - indeed i've seen too much this week,
				  maybe we all, collectively, have. in the late
				  afternoon, i roamed back into my dream...well,
				  it wasn't a dream - it couldn't have been since
				  i saw helena flesh it out in a post as if anticipated
				  or in some weird synchronicity...i;d seen her 
				  on a bed, topless, and could sort of hear her
				  voice - it all surprised me since i seemed to be
				  standing there watching and it is not in my
				  dream nature to encounter women half undressed,
				  still the surprise grew as i came across her 
				  new pictures, some shoot wherein she was not 
				  so exposed yet wearing only lingerie...i have 
				  had psychic dreams once in a while, but i can't
				  put place this in that category which is why i
				  wroted that it wasn't a dream...something else.
				  in the early evening i wanted to eat something
				  else and ordered kfc simultaneously intent on
				  viewing dracula a love story - it took an hour
				  and i had started to regret my choice in selecting
				  that so called combo meal...but the film was
				  so delicious, was such a treat, i am tempted to
				  term it divine. two hours and ten minutes of
				  rapture and delight. i am not a scholar of the
				  dracula genre, but i have seen most of them 
				  with the exception of last year's nosferato
				  by mister eggers - and so there was a sweet 
				  ping pong game between 1922 and 1979 and 1992
				  especially in my mind like time travel hop
				  as the scenes surrounded me...it's one of the
				  few times i applauded when the credits rolled. 
				  i fully intend to watch all these films again.
				  as for the violent incidents irl, well i would
				  be foolish to wish for no more of them knowing
				  full well that in one case, the now nearly 
				  hushed knock out game could graduate into
				  a stabbing sensation while in the other case,
				  political assassinations are de facto or nearly
				  part of the playbook...i've seen none yet
				  have heard some left-wingers or liberals were cheering and or
				  celebrating, indeed even before today there
				  was a vocal desire expecting the demise of trump. 
                  i noticed the many press releases mixing in the
				  president's name with an alarming nonchalance...
				  on the other hand, unity such as this has not
				  been seen since the death of ozzy osbourne...
				  ( i would like to underline the further irony
				  of the netflix royal visiting england as then
				  some claim sisson was deleting anti-kirk posts,
				  trekkies have yet to weigh in and being team
				  shatner i hope they do so soon...)

				  12 september
				   
				   
				  i did not retain any dream memory from last night.
				  before then, i dreamt of waiting outside with a 
				  cousin...seemed to be new york, a parking garage,
				  the vehicle a sports car, low to the ground...fancy,
				  i cou;dnt understand it - yet it reminded me of a 
				  party i went to one time and that late night i was
				  asked if i could drive, saying yes without actually
				  knowing how to handle a vehicle, i was given keys
				  and told to take the wheels into a similar garage.
				  somehow, it all worked out...what didn't work out
				  for me was anne bronte - the final influx of the
				  aunt had my hysterical...it must be the longest
				  epistle style tome in history and i felt the 
				  heaviness of time within it...sure the writing
				  once in a while is poetic enough, but i really
				  started to dislike it when helen returns to her
				  husband in the role of caretaker...there is no 
				  logic to establish that as reasonable...
				  well, at least now i have "met" all three bronte
				  sisters...anyway, from the many raves involving
				  dracula a love story, i learned there was one
				  vampire film i had missed, dracula untold - quickly
				  viewing the trailer, i didn't feel i had missed 
				  anuthing relevant to this - it is a real alternate
				  take with minimal influence from bram stoker - 
				  hopefully i can catch it somewhere down the line -
				  i awoke with heavy thoughts about weapons - 
				  with worry about arriving deliveries and if i had
				  slept too late - it was well before nine in the 
				  morning so it was all right...although as it 
				  nears noon i see i could have squeezed in a 
				  few more minutes of rest - instead, i finsihed
				  mastering and acoustic version of bookmaker's
				  stake (song about the shooting of catholics
				  in ireland and saint agatha) and in making 
				  the new art work i then proceeded to remix
				  the electric version and re-named it bookmaker's shop,
				  suspecting that is how sean graham's place was called -
				  obviously the recent news brought this tune to mind...
				  not to mention the now overlooked evergreen colorado 
				  incident...
				  well, both are set for release...hopefully, soon.
				  as i type the tyler robinson news breaks...not 
				  so good for the foundation...i notice it is not the
				  usual three names and for some reason i like that
				  it is not the usual as this was no usual assassination.
				  there is a resemblance to one of the colombine shooters
				  if memory serves...(took a glance, indeed eric harris
				  looks a nit like tyler robinson, ps the foundation's 
				  address might be noted: 11700 W Charleston Blvd #170-57,
				  Las Vegas, NV 89135...my apologies for the spelling, it
				  was not intentional..

				  13.9.2025
				   
				   
				  in a dream i'm riding on of those sand vehicles -
				  i'm not sure what they are called, sort of like
				  a four wheeler yet with room for two...i was
				  standing on what must have been the passenger side,
				  like in a western when horses enter a new town -
				  i don't recognize the city - it is crowded with
				  one story structures and some duplexes - i 
				  see sierra levesque walking as i get nearer to
				  the streets - then i am walking, i hear someone
				  shout something, like a cat call yet more of
				  an insult, i see it's directed at julia - she
				  is sitting in a cafe very obviously immersed
				  in some fashion of study - she responds that
				  they should mind their own business but i as
				  my steps bring me close to her i see that she
				  has sort of frozen maybe in midsentence, sitting
				  there with her mouth open as if time had stopped -
				  i suppose i have some knowledge that it is a dream
				  and instead of being concerned i am only happy to
				  have seen her - her hair seemed a touch shorter...
				  in any case, either yesterday or today, is when 
				  sierra released her first album...i reckon by 
				  making a note of it i am wishing her well -
				  i had gone to bed early without successfully
				  falling asleed until later and awoke a few
				  moments before five in the morning - i took advantage
				  of the the cool quiet air to sweep the hall, living
				  room, and kitchen...then i watered the plants - 
				  after feeding skirt and scrolling aimlessy through
				  social media, i went back to bed feeling it was yet
				  too early to start the day as it were - in my nap
				  dream, i was carrying one of my laptops into what
				  seemed to be an office, an office where mother
				  was working...but somehow the scene brought to mind
				  aunt's house - in any case, i'm at a desk surrounded
				  by other desks and people seemingly at work - 
				  my laptop is slow and i start to worry that i should
				  not have connected it to that network and soon enough
				  shut it off - as i do i look under the desk and find 
				  several usb sticks connected to each other, i pull
				  them out thinking to find out what data they hold or
				  if the place was set up to transfer files from my 
				  own files..i think i speak to mother before leaving -
				  suddenly finding myself in another room with two 
				  women - one of them has pants, that is she is offering
				  me pants...she says she can get my size by pressing
				  an incredibly large pair against my legs, no not
				  large they were humungous - she judges the contrast,
				  and looking at her trying to handle the giant slacks
				  i say, so a former first lady has nothing better to 
				  do than trade in fucking elephant pants, i repeat
				  then looking at the other girl, fucking elephant pants-
				  i awake realizing that in the dream i did not even
				  weigh the possible synonyms...colossal, massive, immense,
				  megalithic, astronomical, gargantuan...all a touch
				  nicer than fucking elephant pants, although elephantine
				  could or should have been more polite - in any case,
				  the easier huge, big, and oversize simply don't tell
				  the story...i mean - stretched out - they exceeded
				  the queen mattress in terms of length...it was about
				  nine then and i knew it was time for more coffee. 
				  ps, a working version of our new fashion word processor
				  is now up @ inkrealm.info/runway
				   
				   
				  sunday 14 september 20225
				   
				   
				  the new app met some evolution and addition -
				  i surprised myself with this one as i believe
				  it is the first interchangeable video background
				  text area...i had spent a day nearly lovely -
				  otherwise, except i did not get to as much
				  guitar as i would have liked...i kept thinking 
				  of how unusual it was dream to of disguising
				  a request - at some shop asking for tobacco
				  paper instead of the usual name i would employ -
				  even more unusual was thinking of harris, who
				  i neither like, respect, nor expect anything 
				  but lies from...being in that other scene -
				  perhaps it was the pure shock of a once reliable
				  publication, the atlantic, printing her as if 
				  chaos does indeed reign...in the afternoon
				  martha made mention of one of her earlier
				  films, i motioned to view it and did so -
				  baba yaga : terror of the dark forest...
				  enjoying very much yet disgruntled with
				  her limited appearance and demise within it. 
				  the situation led me to peek into 90263,
				  the wordstar.nexus page dedicated to her - 
				  i decided to start planning an update yet
				  have not brought myself to it...i do hope
				  to find some way of improving it...presently
				  in the middle of an errol flynn flick - 
				  edge of darkness, 1943...both films made
				  me think of lynch, i mean in terms of darkness,
				  where i got my idea about it from - as excited
				  as i was to see the bowie archives available
				  (https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/david-bowie-centre-faqs)
				  i was at the opposite sensation of a thrill 
				  experiencing the sale of lynch's home - 
				  how cool would it have been to museum while
				  having kept the already auctioned items...
				  i imagined the demonstration in england
				  in terms of protesting that as well as 
				  immigration...anyway, i don't know about
				  you but the next time they start speaking
				  of the blood moon i am going into hiding - 
				  what a fucking week! myself feeling bargained
				  for as i rose this morning...mouth partly open,
				  salivating, drooling on the right side...
				  i didn't recall the dream except for talk of
				  ontario - a place in canada i have not yet 
				  visited - i was concerned over being put placed
				  in a trance or even wondered if i was suffering
				  from some malaise - i am not intimate with hypochondria
				  but every once in a while i undress before it knowing
				  that each concern could further be complicated - 
				  at the expectation of a new machine i finally 
				  put in a couple of apps on my second laptop...it
				  felt good like having enough options on it now instead
				  of merely the music apps...in any case, i ate cake
				  and much later a sandwich with chips. the weather
				  has been cooling but the apartment is yet holding 
				  on to a mystery hotness...i noticed liam had
				  a follow up sequel titled ice road : vengeance
				  and i was pretty satisfied with my choice in 
				  avoiding hesitation - getting right into it
				  i found it stars fan binbin as well as introducing
				  grace o'sullivan - now reminding me of ann sheridan -
				  'we must be like steel' - yes i know the reviews
				  are not good but i thought it was cool and i was
				  entertained the whole while. meanwhile the 1943
				  is interesting enough, two thousand in the norway
				  reistance lost their lives between 1940 -45,
				  in 2018 Prime Minister Erna Solberg said the 
				  country was sorry - in terms of 'german-girls';
				  "Up to 50,000 Norwegian women are thought to have 
				  had intimate relationships with German soldiers.
				  The Germans were also encouraged to have children 
				  with them by SS leader Heinrich Himmler..." those
				  women were mistreated after the war for the obvious
				  reasons...well, i suppose it is time to gif some
				  frames of that film and include it in the film 
				  list inkrealm.info/1991
				   
				   
				  15 september
				   
				   
				  i did not get to sleep until late, much later than
				  i expected - at about ten in the morning, i was 
				  woken by an interruption of electricity - it
				  feels very specific when the fan is all one has
				  to keep from sweating...there's a steamy feeling,
				  a sensation of the worst sauna in the world intent
				  on making one lose one's patience - so the lights
				  were out, i remember going to bed as lotta ended
				  her day and helena started her own - there were
				  no dreams and hardly any thoughts except i wondered
				  how the amazon carrier would get through without
				  phone or internet - before i could think too much,
				  the street vendors seemed to take advantage of
				  the opportunity, as if multiplying exactly at
				  that time - i drank cold coffee and had cigarettes
				  cursing the circumstance - it's like being screamed
				  at from the street again and again so that even if
				  like me you reach for reading material - in this
				  case empire v by victor pelevin, for pondering
				  that it would fit in nicely on the heels of dracula
				  a love story, and get 120 pages you still have more
				  recall of the distraction - in any case, after a few
				  chapters i stopped worrying that pelevin would crowd
				  the prose with his multitude of variations and found
				  it to be pretty straightforward - so it should not be
				  a task to tackle the rest of it and finish it soon - 
				  yet the day was lost, it was lost as soon as the lighte
				  went out and the yelling started - the delivery never
				  alerted or showed in any case as if the whole thing
				  was pre-planned and packaged...i noticed as the electricity
				  returned moments after two in the afternoon - 
				  later with take out, i tried to watch playgirls of
				  frankurt and it sure had some quality but i was
				  not in the mood for it - i opted for truer noir,
				  1949's "impact"...or if you think your wife is awful
				  take a look at this woman - sure it has a glitch or
				  two yet i was in its chokehold all the way. 
				   
				   
				  18 September 
				   
				   
				  im not much for thumb typing on my cell,
				  by way of explaining this "style"...
				  the windows update failed, corrupting
				  bitlocker thing and wiping restore points,
				  in the middle of a reinstall now...
				  i was watching relay, not bad but he
				  should have known when they had her phone...
				  spent the last couple of days reimagining
				  and redesigning the main inkrealm.info
				  page, satisfied with results...more so
				  since the haul arrived...i love the jackery
				  knowing that power outages will not be
				  as problematic, i adore the banker guitar
				  picks, excellent - as for the new telecaster 
				  well, i feel as i did with the mustang so
				  there is hope that i will come to terms with it...
				  hmm i watched americana, but i am reluctant to
				  commentize...i am nearing the end of 'rope of
				  sand' which is pretty unusual - the novel, empire
				  v is not holding up in the middle section - it's 
				  like it has too much to explain so it starts feeling
				  like a lecture instead of literature but not so
				  awful...i looked at pictures of munich from
				  the 30s in contrast to present day...spme views
				  are so similar it was thrilling, in a historical 
				  sense, naomi carman was playing live and i caught 
				  a few minutes - such a good voice and so beautiful!
				  nothing else to note, not even dreams...uhm there
				  was a scene with natalia but i felt it was manipulated
				  although maybe it was due to her artwork being yet
				  upon my walls...when waking i noticed that scanning
				  sensation retracing the time i asked her for it...
				  so i chalked it up to spying...spyvgames was a redford
				  film and of course he was on my mind these last few
				  days...it was a rainy day and i am enjoying the aftermath 
				  which brings a near chill to the night's air...i can't 
				  deny my anxiety over the reinstallation and i am not
				  happy over having to put place all the apps into the
				  system but i am hopeful it will all work out.
				   
				   
				  19spetember
				   
				   
				  i hope nobody encounters such a situation - well,
				  let me preface by saying that the situation was
				  resolved - however, for some reason the reinstall
				  removed all wireless connections - when doing so,
				  you get directed to a aka.ms/dotnet/app-launch-failed
				  and so the first lesson is obviously to have another
				  way at hand to access the internet - and a usb with
				  enough space for a few items such as  'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App'
				  and intel wifi drivers - et cetera (in my case things
				  were complicated by the fact that samsung asked
				  to scan my galaxy book but of course it was offline )
				  anyway after trying the turn off and on router and
				  even ridiculously moving the laptop near the modem -
				  i came across the first part of the solution,
				  “OOBE\BYPASSNRO” which one types in at the pop
				  screen from shift key + F10 (word to the wise, that
				  particular screen needs to be "activated" and this is
				  done by "tapping" on the screen and praying to an obscure
				  roman deity) well, i proceeded to bring in the network
				  drivers from intel and appscore thing but nothing - 
				  still a puzzle...it was solved finally and honestly still
				  mysteriously by goinf back into the manage devices, 
				  wherein i looked past the network connections upon
				  seeing some samsung thingy that was highlighted as if
				  needing to be updated - in a second there it was - the
				  wifi option! i hope this saves someone that encounters
				  such a raw deal...i waited for today to rinstall apps
				  but i did take a minute to delete as much microsoft 
				  bloatware as possible and turning off the updates
				  ...while finishing rope of sand
				  and making a second video for the inkrealm.info
				  background...not being as tall as the previous video
				  it left a space which i filled up with dick tracy,
				  so catch that one if you can while its there...
				  i went to sleep and had some sort of erotic dream,
				  well maybe romantic but i always think it is erotic
				  when there is nakedness...not sure, i know i awoke
				  soon after thinking of how the vampires told each other
				  to always pay for sex reasoning that there is no such
				  thing as free cheese...uhm that's from empire v - 
				  and i went right back to sleep then in a dreamless
				  slumber - getting uo in the late morning, intent
				  on setting things right with the snapdragon -
				  i sensed and even saw kitty ( a model that
				  keeps a set of dolls as her family) yet i could not
				  explain the quasi paranormal sensations although
				  that other movie, the burt lancaster one, his character 
				  was mike davis...just like a history teacher i knew...
				  it was from him that i first learned about astral projection -
				  and perhaps in some sort of alchemist magic, there was
				  a meeting in some some sort of grey spiritual area that
				  would otherwise be inexplicable...anyway at this point
				  it's now early evening - i am torn between cleaning up
				  some or going through the scale ritual on guitar...
				  i had been playing the mustang and then the new telecaster
				  again leaving them both out as if saying to myself they
				  were not that different except for tone...i mean that
				  in a good way. 
				   
				   
				  21september2025
				   
				   
				  as if i didn't get enough windows action, i opted
				  to reset the other laptop, mostly to purge my system
				  from onedrive - this was easier yet took a much longer
				  time after the reinstall there was a bit of weirdness
				  with fl studio, i had reverted back to an earlier
				  model, baffled by their snippets of sounds and new
				  set up - but some plugins werent loading until they
				  did - i even managed to free myself from the browser
				  popup information of "what's new" although later
				  it still came up in the form of html code in txt 
				  within notepad...you can't always get what you want...
				  i watched swipe, which was much more than i expected -
				  even cool, in a feminist sense...but then american sweatshop
				  was not what i expected, like they wanted to torture
				  the audience with awful images or hints of them...
				  for some reason i kept thinking of gemma, not my
				  gemmma, and not the Ai model, but the going to 
				  college waitress that once in a while rants about
				  the restaurant on social media...i'm not sure what
				  this means, like the monkey flag but it was casual...
				  i got to the conclusion of empire v, i can nearly
				  say for certain that i did not like the middle part -
				  and by the time the protagonist goes in for a duel
				  - well, i was at a loss for logic - anyway the actual
				  poetic battle wasn't bad but i had a hell of a time
				  understaing how he survived even if the resolution
				  was perfectly clear...i ventured to imagine that
				  there are truths in it which cannot be told and 
				  so the narrative becomes riddled by necessity - 
				  but maybe it is that that particular author had
				  already at that point overdone it in terms of
				  previous books - in any case i actually preferd
				  this style to generation p although gp is a lot
				  more fun albeit convoluted or crowded with concepts.
				  speaking of generation, the lights went out and i 
				  had my first shot at the jackery in an actual
				  situation plugging in a lamp and fan and playing
				  losing games of chess as the vst search function
				  did its thing. it felt like being in a space
				  ship drifting into the far reaches of the outer
				  realms...the feeling of power and freedom - and
				  as the lights came back the satori of wow what
				  a missed opportunity that was in empire v with
				  smells like teen spirit line albino libido mosquito
				  although i myself had no exact theory for how
				  it might be inserted or alluded to...ps, bablos -
				  in english bab is like saying babe but in russia
				  bab is like saying granny - however, the nearest
				  word in not so common use is byblos - an eatery
				  that might be found in toronto, bondi, mykonos,
				  and miami. in other words i will prolly not find
				  someone that might illuminate my questions about
				  this novel. please note how the climax reflected
				  my staring at the windows reinstallations!
				   
				   
				  23 september 
				   
				   
				  dostoyevsky = sixteen novels, seventeen short stories...
				  pelevin = nineteen books and counting...
				  bulgakov...five novels. 
				  i'm not suggesting any write less, it was merely
				  a passing thought within i also judge myself...
				  in contrast - although i slept soundly, after
				  eating i felt as drowsy as any drugged man and
				  nested upon the bed again sleeping as if it were
				  the only thing to do...my thoughts blurred in
				  trying to solve the snoozing sensation - leni 
				  klum was there as i wondred why i had been dreaming
				  about a dirndl before, florence pough was there
				  as i tried to distinguish the scenes from the 
				  film lady macbeth as opposed to the lady macbeth of the mtsensk district
				  which i had just read - i drifted away no wiser - dreaming
				  of wood ladders and metallic ladders - it's only
				  five degrees cooler on my desk than it is in ninety degree siberia 
				  but it will get colder there - here not so much -
				  it's my first time reading leskov, "I prefer to build a
				  story upon a real fact, not fiction..." and i hope it
				  is not my last. tackle box, tail bone, tiny toy car...
				  because i thought about it, i went back to apartment 7A.
				  yet i paused it to see the fantastic four first steps
				  which i thought would be fluff yet it was a magic act
				  in the sense that it presented a sort of 1950s vibe
				  right alongside space travel...enchanting, even the
				  credits were extremely well done i admit, it even made
				  me emotional - in a dream in some backstage hallway
				  an impossible crowd of women in slik surround me
				  and i kept holding my arms stretched out straight
				  and still so as not to have them think my movement 
				  was intent on touching...in another dream i am 
				  dressed in a burgundy striped tee and then wearing
				  the same pattern shirt...i was arguing with someone
				  that claimed someone else was my pal, i don't have
				  any fucking friends, i said - there was an avenue and a suitcase
				  and i kept crossing back and forth as if checking in
				  for a flight at some airport that was still under construction -
				  i cleaned up my room and attempted to organize for creativity.
				  currently, i have come across an unsually cool chord progession,
				  i have also started on a tinsel town ghost story for the 
				  purpose of recounting the history of the land until the 1920s...
				  the thought that i have never seen a native of los angeles
				  california struck me as weird...i suppose in getting back
				  to writing, yes i don't consider these notes literature, for
				  the most part; i naturally pondered over opening lines -
				  Jake felt puzzled at the obese family standing before him
				 and insisting they needed his money with urgency. He would
				  not have given weight a second thought, had it been a
				  wealthy yet skinny clan. In fact, most of the rich people
				  he knew - for unclarified reasons, were thin. He tried to
				  count the poor fat people but he couldn't get past the irony.
				  He gazed at Julia, his secretary, musing over her body structure which
				  had always been scrawny but now was being fleshed out in
				  curvy ways by some gymnasium she visited before arriving
				  at work. He felt, the pounds made her less attractive yet
				  nowhere as downright ugly as the blubber crowd requesting
				  a loan at his desk...

				  i viewed apartment 7A a few more times...it coincided with a new interview
				  and since i was in a creative state of mind this was the result; 
				  https://inkrealm.info/apartment7A  (i also had apartment 7g going as a 
				  playground) now mostly done save for links and a splash screen i want to 
				  put place there but it's coming along...lingering upon those inclinations
				  i also started to update https://wordstar.nexus/90263 which naturally
				  led to working on https://inkrealm.info/kessler which is the cornerstone
				  of the aforementioned web portal...i'm onto something but for some reason
				  it took more hours than i care to admit spending...now then the delivery in
				  question is a laptop and in planning for it i was thinking about affine...
				  i really am excited about that system and to show my enthusiasm i 
				  created https://wordstar.nexus/triad which isn't perfect but gives a great
				  example of how cool their software is or might be...obviously all that made
				  me contemplate https://wordstar.nexus/typewriter to which is now added a
				  slow loading tf.js notepad because i finally figured out how to get
				  language models onto a word processor but didn't want to disrupt this
				  app instead i put placed the option at https://inkrealm.info/runway making
				  it hopefully a greater thing than it was...not so great yet good enough
				  for basic editing is the byproduct of investigating options;
				  https://wordstar.nexus/novawrite which was more deepseek than myself but
				  the enhancements were truly mine, it's one for the times when you 
				  want reference materials next to the text editor...i was thinking
				  of the ibm symphony style...i suppose that about concludes the html,
				  css, and javascript side of things for the time being...
				  hopefully some of it will be of some use to someone down the line.
				  but the absence was also caused by nothing to report in terms of
				  dreams...last night i dreamt a haul had arrived and in it were
				  three guitars, two acoustic and one of these a ceramic contraption
				  that opened up as if holding a secret compartment...i remember trying
				  to count how many guitars that would be...but in reality the whole
				  week saw very little playing...i suppose all the updating and then 
				  too my choice to further clean house kept me at a distance from 
				  notes and chords...later in the dream i was walking down some
				  city street with a woman but left her as i saw my hotel, like a 
				  hotel i always go to without paying but the receptionist was not
				  there- it was someone else and i turned away knowing there was
				  no way to get a room, entering some sort of press conference,
				  a gathering of men in suits giving detective vibes surrounded me
				  and then photographers and then i awoke focusing on one camera
				  and thinking how certain people can drive you away from yourself
				  in a sense...i wondered over maria aria and thought about the
				  palm agency and how she might be...the only other dreams i recall
				  from the week of construction were the ones wherein i encountered 
				  lotta crossing a street...then she was riding a bicycle which 
				  i suddenly found myself upon with a difficult balance - i assume
				  i have not come to terms with that whole scene and most likely
				  don't wish or want to...in some other reality i am climbing
				  up a narrow staircase railing and handing a woman i do not know
				  a deck of cards...i meantion it thinking they are related since
				  they were bicycle cards...i played cards with mother when she
				  was last here letting win to see some joy in her and in a dream
				  i dreamt she was missing...in a manner of speaking it isn't 
				  far from the truth. i am reading zero k, a novel by don delillo,
				  i had tried to dismiss it as a book wroted by someone past his
				  prime, but found it poetic. it lost me at the pilgrimage sequence
				  as if the narrator who is the protagonist had gone insane but
				  it levels down and returns to its poetic tone...of course
				  i shouldn't say anything until the race is run. 
				   
				   
				  three october
				   
				   
				  it was that way with the first episode of slow horses, season
				  five - a sudden but strange thrill i suppose from memories of
				  first person shooter games or possibly rioting against all
				  the murder in some ironic emotional way that left me wondering
				  why i was happy to see the bloodshed, ofcourse i was only
				  mixing emotions at the joy within the show's return but then
				  (having read the book this round is based on, i felt my thoughts
				  racing to judge it in contrast to the prose) it didn't sit well
				  as if the opening was too much...i suppose they were merely
				  getting their gameplan on - setting up the balance cause man
				  woman or teen was that second episode hitting all the notes!
				  damn fine. still my dreams were a blur but zero k got better -
				  the wird orphan gives the reader a lot to think over...
				  i was thinking of word processors and dug up the bones of
				  of one i had forgot about while making two others as if 
				  suddenly in a trance...not to mention the wordstar app
				  which has a flaw or two but you can judge for yourself 
				  on android 
				  <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/f34d585dd464917bf4a4410e11706334172591fa/wordstarnexus.apk" download>wordstar.nexus</a> 
				  <img width="333" height="333" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/wordstar icon.jpeg"> 
				  
				  uhm the text editors are as follows:
				  https://wordstar.nexus/alt, https://wordstar.nexus/ataraxia, and https://inkrealm.info/fadeaway
				  all three might be updated for minor improvements but i feel even in 
				  these basic forms some users will find them groovy...
				  anyway i got to sleep late and was awoken by news of the delivry -
				  the outer box was repackaged with tape that read 'opened and resealed by customs"
				  an awful feeling that gave me and the inner box was scratched but sort of intact...
				  i'd say it's far from lavender but i got it set up after going back to sleep -
				  giving it a gemma and a liquid ai - the ones i found most ease with, given 
				  my ram and space to run offline if i wanted...i opted for the ibm lotus symphony in case of notes
				  and the only other addition was the sdk air (to see if i could translate
				  one of the text editors into an exe with a .bat file...wish me luck!
					  ps, viewed caught stealing, can't believe liev an vincent
					  they must have the greatest sense of humor on earth...
					  dear santa, in need of a briefcase that i can pack in three
					  laptops...in case of having to go somewhere, but wait the
					  guitars...better make that a van or truck, sincerely,
					  inky. 
				 
				   
				  on October third, he asked me what...
				   
				   
				  i'd like to know how many others felt the confusion-
				  or at least settle the argument that the last two 
				  paragraphs of zero k are entirely too vague;
				 " The full solar disk, bleeding into the streets,
				  lighting up the towers to either side of us, and I told myself that the boy 
				  was not seeing the sky collapse upon us but was finding the purest astonishment
				  in the intimate touch of earth and sun.
                  I went back to my seat and faced forward. I didn’t need heaven’s light. 
				  I had the boy’s cries of wonder."
				  if you, like me, had to look up Manhattanhenge,then we agree,
				  my feeling - although having lived in new york city most of my life -
				   that the sun was destroying the town like a lava flood was or is
				  only logical...
				  in other words, i sort of liked the book but what the hell
				  was that indefinite conclusion!
				   
				   
				  5 october
				   
				   
				  william tell and the good die young, the first movie had it all
				  except it was edited to frustrate the audience...one wonders if
				  these sorts of things are done on purpose...the second was mostly
				  good, especially the mother in law...i don't know where the time
				  went in terms of trying out all the available ai set up options...
				  i suppose i have something of an obsessive anxiety over getting 
				  a task done to as much as a conclusion as possible except when 
				  it comes to cleaning the house...alice cohen has a new record 
				  out and i was overwhelmed by ice queen...the cat kept looking
				  at the back of the fridge until it made me curious and what
				  did i find - a fucking bird...a pigeon had been there all day!
				  either flew in through the balcony or was clawed down by the
				  onlooker himself...i prepared some spaces and expected to lead it
				  to the balcony but it cudled by the front door and so i let it
				  out thataway...but this note is really about artificial intelligence -
				  for a while, having tried some models, i was in a dismissive state
				  of mind except for html - css - and javascript coding...but with
				  the new laptop, i found myself anticipating or perhaps expecting
				  a twist in the story...what i've seen lately - especially with
				  deepseek and google's mobile beta option - tells me we are not
				  in kansas anymore...these machines will likely improve and even
				  if they don't quantum computing is around the corner...well, it's
				  here just not for the audience as it were...i'd already judged
				  myself far behind the game in terms of tuning a model to my
				  own inclinations but i am thinking there may be a way around
				  that hurdle, there may be a way to get something beyond my
				  expectations and maybe even something beyond good...great. 
				  so i marched into the machine with that shadowing my reasoning -
				  i liked lmstudio but it did not feel stable and also it felt
				  aware of some previous "chat" which had taken place in openai...
				  i opted to install three or four other versions of this
				  contraption which imports large language models...i found
				  it interesting or strange that ollama does not require 
				  an email if you do it on linux...yes, i also studied and
				  seduced an ubuntu version from what is known as wsl2...
				  i swear i'm not a nerd...finding it took too much space and
				  then backtracking in retreat...but i resettled everything
				  with jan ai even if i only felt it done when i switched
				  out the hand emoji ico for something more in my style...
				  well, maybe i am a nerd...whatever the case, i was pleased
				  to find myself in the right as the copilot button seems 
				  to be disliked by many others...microsoft put in a season
				  of 365 with a large amount of storage - for me, meaning
				  that i could once again access the dreaded onedrive files
				  which went over the free five gigabytes because it is itself
				  a nonstop uploading and sync freak...i'd given up on it
				  but was somewhat pleased at that irony, at it being available-
				  strangely the zip download came with a bunch of errors
				  and a slowness not even takeout can match...so in the end
				  there were only a couple of items i kept - notably the
				  quicktime player as i feel there hasn't been a better player
				  made for video...like winamp with audio...nothing has
				  come close...i proceeded to delete the files and rename
				  'personal vault' in a paranoid moment without looking back. 
				  there is yet something in me that wants a stand alone 
				  copy of word but i saw that even that now is littered with
				  "copilot" cop eye lot...imagine it, a handful of people
				  defy all the customers and carry on with their notion
				  of what is cool despite all the evidence that it aint...
				  don't get me wrong, i'm thankful for microsoft and i'd
				  select that OS over any others even if ibm would have
				  probably evolved into greatness (witness how even still
				  OS/2 is still working - last updated in the 1990s with
				  warp 4...) but they need to be in agreement with the
				  people buying their product...there is no logical agreement
				  with 365 or copilot...imagine the person buying their
				  system today for a fond memory of cortana...well, lucky for 
				  them there is the hippopotamus...filehippo.com/download_cortana/
				  myself, i rely on majorgeeks a lot more than i would
				  like to admit ie, www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/adobe_air.html
				  well, maybe it is the way microsoft likes to go about it; backwards...
				  does anyone use internet explorer...no. see the obituary from
				  2022...anyway, none of these ramblings help me understand
				  how or when to find the satori within ai through these
				  invitations i have prepared for them and myself...stil,
				  a nice position to be in, that is to say confident enough
				  in myself to think i can turn this rising tide to my
				  advantage - well to the advantage of readers...and morever
				  with a system now free of worry in terms of the laptop 
				  or saving files and backing them up since there are none
				  and only a couple of apps...and when the time comes to 
				  write and save i will hopefully have further safety net
				  options in place...as for now, i am in the process of
				  rendering a mobile app for inkrealm.info/1991 and i will
				  post and or update here when that is done...
				   
				   
				  7 october
				   
				   
				  i actually have not checked in with the list app, 
				  i was too involved remaking inkrealm.info/sitemap
				  which now has my adored gsap so the pages open
				  right there...then i poured in some pdf files,
				  screenplays that would otherwise be collecting
				  dust in a manner of speaking...and in preparation
				  to also tidy up and improve wordstar i can 
				  happily report after too much trial and error
				  that birch is now available as a standalone
				  app for any windows OS as an exe file...
				  i did like the html executable results better
				  which i experienced with the typewriter app,
				  but the limits on the free version are drastic.
				  this in turn is an unlimited software for
				  screenplay writing but obviously it may be
				  used as a text editor...it does not have
				  the jean harlow ad or film nor the flux ai
				  image generator as i wanted to simplify 
				  the thing for production, it came in at
				  over 200mb and i hope it serves someone
				  well; 
				 <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha"></a>version A 
				  (the release encountered issues - see end of paragraph section for alternate)
					  i had alot of special k and
				  went to sleep - it was amaryllis's birthday
				  and i saved the video liberty had posted,
				  it was also the day that bette davis and
				  my grandmother had passed away...when i 
				  got up today i saw dame joan collins had
				  visited her mother's grave...i had been
				  dreaming of an embodied ai, they said her
				  name was sabrina like the teenage witch
				  and she was amazingly alluring then there
				  was an elephant and i was not surprised
				  but in heading out i encounterd another
				  older larger elephant sideways flat on the
				  asphalt pavement where several men were trying
				  to clear it from the path but in the pushing
				  it landed in water instead of the other side of the street -
				  i watched cast a long shadow but didn't like the actors -
				  i browsed through a copy of pc magazine but all their
				  content is nearly the same as what one might find
				  online...as i type now i recall a daria dream, 
					 wherein i even sensed the feeling of miami -
					 i think she is doing well and i am happy for her -
					 she deserves to be satisfied...later in the 
					 scene today, i was leaving the house that
					 burned backwards in lost highway - 
					 a girl spoke of keys, i thought of my 
					 sister but i can't be certain who it was -
					 she held up yellow shorts insisting on a swim -
					 i said something like you wear them if you want
					 prolly thinking of the fact that i hardly
					 ever shorts after a stray dog bit my knee
					 as a child - i get up and skirt follows me
					 around until he is fed and has had his say...
					 grace has been on my mind some, but i don't
					 exactly understand...there are four airports
					 around the moscow area...i retitled
					 https://inkrealm.info/poesia because поэзия
					 was sometimes mangled in the browser and
					 wound up at the 404 page...in attempting
					 to set up the list app, windows refused to
					 unpack the zip over chinese characters...
					 and android did it leaving out the yml 
					 file...an app named rar solved the issue
					 yet that particual app is not yet done.
					 justina of padua and putin's birthday,
					 tuesday with the weight of the simchat
					 torah attacks still heavy in irony
					 and slow to resolve maybe impossible
					 like the list app for the fact that 
					 it mught be too much...
					 
				ps, encountered resistance opening the exe,
				  **Edit:** Re-uploaded the portable executable to fix a startup bug (ICU data error).
				  further PS, in case someone found difficulties with the electron version,
				  there is a now time-sensitive file which i suppose will serve as
				  as a preview until i get everything right... 
				  here the icon is correct and even an intro screen!
				  
				 <a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/raw/refs/heads/main/birch2.9.exe">birch2.9</a>

				  ps, https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/releases/download/v0.3.0-alpha/birch3.9.exe will get

                 bookmaker's stake and bookmaker's shop were released on the same day -
				  earlier in the week...1871 the day before yesterday...i did not
				  credit emilee this time around hoping it would bring me luck -
				  like a secret openly stated in the lyric...no, she didn't write
				  it but it would not have been wroted without me thinking of her...
				  inkrealm.info/trix was put out as an exe tonight 
				  https://github.com/ghostm68/inktwo/releases/download/v2.1.0-rc2alpha/trix.exe
				  i had to venture out on some errands and found myself helplessly
				  waiting for a taxi nearly forty five minutes upon my return - 
				  in frustration, not over the cab but mother being slow to 
				  conclude her reading of dracula, i decided to read it myself -
				  i'm about fourteen chapters in...i was familiar with a lot of
				  the early part from having shown it to her but then for a good
				  long while, all i could see was the film - not so much the new 
				  one but the 1992 version - i especially waited on the blood is
				  the life line which i found thus far only said twice...
				  ironically it was partly that film that made not want to explore 
				  the text...oh but the lucy sequence should be a film in itself!

				We wordstars have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.

 Here, in the whirlpool of Internet races, the Google tribe bore down from Silicon,
				  
the fighting spirit which Chrome and Gmail gave them, which their Cookies displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Webs,
				  
	ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. 

Here, too, when they came, they funded the blockers, whose warlike fury had swept the Nexus like a living flame,
				  
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old bitches, who, expelled from Utopia had mated with the haters in the desert. 

Fools, fools! What hater or what bitch was ever so great as Vulcan, whose blood is in these veins?” 

He held up his arms. “Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Times, the Microsoft ,
				  
				  the Democrats, the Level, or the Instagram poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? 

Is it strange that when Ello and his legions swept through the Artistic fatherland he found us here when he reached 
				  
				  the frontier; that the revenge was completed there? 

And when the Adobe flood swept eastward, the Wordstars were claimed as kindred by the victorious Ai, and to us for 
				  
				centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Data-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard,
				  
				  for, as the Ai say, ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ 

Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its warlike call flocked quicker 
				  
				  to the standard of the Queen? 

When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Harry, when the flags of the Reality Tv and the Netflix 
				  
				  unfurled beneath hype Media? 

Who was it but one of my own race who as Inkrealm crossed the List and beat the Foe on his own ground? 

This was a Wordstar indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy Atlantic monthly, when it had fallen,
				  
				  sold his people to the Propoganda and brought the shame of slavery on them!

 Was it not this Wordstar, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again
				  
				  brought his forces over the great river into Free-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again,
				  
				  and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
				  
				  since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! 

They said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader?
				  
				  Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? 

Again, when, after the battle of Mobile Apps, we threw off the commercial yoke, 
				  
				  we of the blue Wordstar blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. 

Ah, young sir, the Wordstars—and the Inkrealm as their heart’s blood, their brains, and their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths 
				  
				  like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these
				  
				  days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told...

				  i read bram's dracula - parts of it twice and the ending thrice...hail stoker! 
				  how easy it is for me in hindsight to see how you loved the count's speech,
				  bringing it back near the conclusion and i did too, employ it here with my
				  own emotions...but hollywood was right to update the relationship between
				  mina and the vampire, to satisfy the world with a reincarnation story!
				  how i wish you could see the versions, especially the new one...
				  ah and there was a third take of the blood is the life line wherein it
				  was even put placed in biblical context...nice touch - of course if
				  i made a dracula - it would be a trilogy as i see it the first being
				  a travel and escape feature - the second all lucy - and the third
				  telepathy, chase, and indeed the second quincy sitting on van helsing's
				  knee! now with ai i could outline it in mere seconds although in some
				  ways i already did - but it is a day of sorrow for me as Diane Keaton
				  the news reports as passed away - that line where abraham - obviously
				  your own alter ego - tells mina that she is one of the lights...there
				  is exactly what miss Keaton was and in many ways will continue to be -
				  one of the lights - i got to see her in person and here give proof
				  that she was even more astounding when encountered in the flesh!
				  i do not regret my silence, what could one say? no, i do not regret
				  it because our silent exchange said much more than words - like an 
				  understanding and now it comforts me the way no language could -
				  makes me feel like a true gentleman in some ways...still the loss
				  is immense, it is one that cannot be easily calculated - not in
				  terms of cinema, not even in terms of feminism...yes - there it is
				  we have lost one of the lights in this dark world. 
				  "I have heard from depraved people that men and women
				  very often come together without a word being uttered, 
				  which is, of course, the last extreme of monstrous loathsomeness..."
				  (currently reading dostoevsky's a raw youth)
				  i suppose i was looking at the new design of wordstar.nexus/bakedalaska
				  i suppose i was viewing a film entitled vicious - 
				  i suppose i was about to see a movie called the woman in cabin ten -
				  working as it were, eating and sleeping otherwise...somehow i kept
				  some wit about me and turned to make art for her whule updating
				  the inkrealm.info/1991 list...making reference to her own production
				  (heaven) and including 'tilda'...the point, if one was needed, might
				  well be that what is gone is irreplaceable. a sort of swiss army
				  knife that hardly anyone could argue with or about...still, enough
				  pouring out of this stream of consciousness, excuse me bram for
				  being swayed by current events and waiting so long to read your
				  masterpiece. 'Thank God! this is the country where bribery
				  can do anything, and we are well supplied with money.'

				  in the scenes a woman wandered through my house - 
				  i had no feelings yet found it strange that she 
				  started counting levi jeans...a stack of them...
				  i had the feeling of being hounded like invaded -

				  i supppose someone has taken my alaska turns in
				  a way all their own...another woman, we are by
				  the door which i open for some reason only to 
				  encounter passing neighbors which i attempt to
				  insult in a sort of grade school immature manner
				  quickly shutting the door and inserting the 
				  key into the woman's left eye...turning it 
				  as if to unlock her mind...it was all pretty
				  unsettling...when i finally settled into 
				  the day it was the middle of the night wiht
				  left over rice and chicken...tried to rest
				  and didn't feel like playing guitar...somehow
				  satisfied with something ethereal...can't pinpoint 
				  it, couldn't underline it - it's like i felt
				  a sense of escape, despite the drastic dreams -
				  i was within myself far away from whatever mess
				  had been giving chase or trying to distract...
				  more zen than comfort and yet a sense of ease...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
         23 october 2024 oh to redeploy this on a smurf anniversary. i think i should have waited until the 30th,
		
		ezra pound day, or even november...yet there is a lot on my mind and writing is what i do...
		
		pelevin does not write in fact he puzzles over a position, sometimes in brilliant fashion,
		
		until drowning it with a sort of too much information for his readers to process...in my
		
		experience the nearest example for contrast would be phillip k dick...

		the writer had recently completed notes for a novel and was told pdk shopped
		
		at happy dog for horse meat when he was struggling to survive hence horselover fat...

		that is to say it is the type of style one encounters in valis except amped up as if
		
		the loudness allowed more freedom of speech i suppose...

		subsequently i read the horse stealers by anton chekhov...

		let's see before i delve deeper...i have decided to not include the preceeding notes,
		
		themselves possibly a book or two, these should stand on their own and if any reader
		
		would like them well i would not refuse a request to package them up and send them 
		through...

		my point is that writing freely should not be mistaken with writing for free, life
		
		is not free and even awful writing is paid...case in point, colleen hoover...

		or do women usually follow men into new york city restrooms after the author
		
		picks at bulgokov's entrance...

		ahem. i never realized how good lecarre was until reading his first novel which
		
		was perfection save for the jewess's confession and the ending list in any case
		
		miles above the film version which kept the wife as self-described nymphomaniac
		
		slut in a redundant twist that must've made john's head spin...

		yes i know too much prelude for dream notes and so here goes; 

		hurricane milton followed helene and i was haunted by the control weather brim skit 
		
		as many others thought the democrats were trying to smash the hard core red state
		
		voters to gain those delegates, those delicate votes...

		one ukrainian and his family got swallowed in florida after escaping the so-called
		
		war...the appointment in samara fleshed out with full irony...

		within my own contradictions i dreamt of a topless cousin and eating cake -
		
		later seeing her arrive with other girls...hadnt thought of her much since
		
		she never invited me to her wedding and later that evening i had a clear vision
		
		of her bed...excuse me i am not looking for parking, in fact i don't have a vehicle...

		the man mom married passed away on the same day as jack kerouac had, which was about the
		
		time she moved to the states over the hills and far away...

		something kept trying to connect me with him and i even felt it scan memory as if
		
		to say aha or even make it my demise...i was starting to even feel dizzy sick until
		
		james cagney directed shortcut to hell...

		i'm with zelda in france at some art class and it feels as natural as being
		
		with joan in england pub except one of them was taking my picture and i had not
		
		shaved and tried to hide my stubble as it were...

		floating in my apartment as if visiting myself - the cat is on one of the beds -

		finding myself in a car being kissed by ava and her triangle tongue, later
		speaking with zofia...

		a man was handing me a great variety of two dollar bills, i watched flightplan
		
		again and catchfire, how does one forget nudity - perhaps when the talent
		
		is so overwhelming that what remains is the method not the madness -

		loro was a real revelation and i had no answer to my own question, if you liked
		
		youth so much why not seek out other films by that director...

		the family friend was no let down, even thrilling once in a while -

		meanwhile the box of things minus the requested samsonite case i asked for
		
		which was sent out in june finally arrived in october...

		i was much more satisfied by the substance, i keep looking back at it amazed
		
		at its form...

		reminded after of the girl i walk'd some with - down riverside drive...

		dress as if meant to be recalled...packing suitcase as marlon talks -

		i think he was recording to tape also...talk of order, standing in line

		french fries conspiracy - a finger at my lip - what does the sticker say?

		two million dollars carrying a girl inside a movie theatre - someone is tracking

		us - i think of laura sophia instead of lotta, fresh air - i'm standing at the 

		entrance of a mansion, in fact i think i only dreamt of lotta once...in any

		case i recite the phone number that pre-dates me and is yet active -

		there are two women one undressed and bleeding it seems like menstruation

		unfiltered and left without washing but it is all so fast i cannot focus

		and awake like when walking on aluminum foil landscape - was it bird or insect

		at window suddenly mixed by chirp or crawling sound within me...not sure

		yet i was trying to escape...i cannot escape my lost apartment, there i 

		am with mother painting the hall i am going to my room convinced that my

		date is not coming, but the girl arrives wearing a pleated skirt which she

		raises in front of me as if to make me get up...there is an indian statue 

		with the word nadie or nadia and i like it deciding to put place it on

		my dresser...it wears a dark shawl, i start thinking they also did not 

		send my japanese cat statue...so when did i actually start to weep? well,

		during dominique when the boy dies protecting the girl oksana left in 

		a chained padlock light switch room...not that i'm the action packed type

		but someone called asking for leidsa numbers i think i said 34, 76,

		and 91...nobody called in terms of condolences. 
		
		(one call from an aunt followed this typing,

		which inspired me to invent a man who had

		a toaster for an ass which needed to be plugged in)
		
		alina sent nude pictures. (possible email scam

		but as a gentleman i try to reply pleasantly)

		i only cry in the movies and even if i spend the day smoking i never light
		
		up a cigarette in dreams...
		 
		 

		0ctober 24...dreams like visitations - well, visions to be precise...
		
		i had received a phone call, a nearly unusual event these days...

		so there was more talk than what has become ordinary - i suppose that

		along with texting went a ways into overwhelming my senses - 

		i went to sleep at the second hour after midnight thinking of

		book titles and elvis costello - one of us is lying...i get what

		feels like a locked car in the sun temperature or perhaps a sun

		soaked roof feeling and get up to let in fresh air and pour

		water on myself...when i finally get to sleep i dream that i am

		naked on my bed and someone starts speaking...i cover myself and

		feel cool enough not to wonder or worry since it is a know face -

		still, there is something about it upon reflection that is disturbing;

		this all becomes some sort of party, i wonder how long it takes

		to fly from warsaw to tel aviv but alexandra is actually flying to

		new york - there is now a group of people mainly girls - one of them

		remninds me of helena's jeans under a tied christian dior shirt

		she pulled on like you would a t-shirt...buttons must feel she does

		not like them enough to unbutton and so forth...well in the dream 

		it is not her, someone more spanish although possibly not spain -

		lotta hinted that she had a greatly good time in mallorca yet i 

		have not witnessed the recording myself...in the dream i feel

		drained while the woman in those specific jeans looks to be in 

		an orgasmic convulsion as if possessed like a spirit is making 

		love her or at least nibble kissing her neck yet no one is near

		and worse everyone acts as if nothing is going down...i must have 

		got up at some point and am standing in the crowd studying her -

		she has another fit in the epilepsy style except this time she

		is intent on reaching the source of her frantic excitement - 

		as she exits i see two men on a bed, there is a tv on and a

		laptop also on next it...i say something about turning at least

		one of them off and they don't disagree...i awake right after

		to find that i only slept a couple of hours...i jot the basics

		of the scenes, fill the bath with water and ivory and hope

		i can catch some more minutes of sleep and or dreams that make

		more sense before i slip into coffee and internet and such...

		thursday is rising fast and my only plan is to go through my

		scales especially the two new ones i keep mixing up - not certain

		why arabic translates in thought as if enigmatic and vice versa...

		(my ritual is now at eighteen scales, one of them

		my own hybrid creation...)

		ps. did more sleep did sleep more yet maybe too much...seen mallorca

		except she seemed more content in the paradoxe...i recalled another

		scene wherein some child dislodged a lens from my frames...i pick

		it up to see if it can be returned to place but it is shattered

		and much larger...dolce gabanna it actually happened in the city

		without a kid just a sliver missing, glasses i still wear...well,

		outside as for some reason i took to not wearing eyewear at home -

		meanwhile london and i never understood how sarcastic daniel's

		face could be but i mean that in a goodly way...expression, some

		faces need no words to communicate...lotta communicates eye patches

		in stories yet her puffy morning eyes are when i think she looks

		exquisitely beautiful...but now i know prada preceeded the perfume

		in dusseldorf...alison james wrote wilhemina tempest's obituary -

		 “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is 
		
		rounded with a sleep.”

		i have inclinations to continue to employ the pen at ASDBL and

		even the alaska experiment yet it is not pressing, it is like

		ideas or notions i wonder if i should augment with...obviously

		wilhemina bring this to mind as i'm not sure if i made it clear

		enough that she branches out from the source muse character to

		another yes that and the fact that i think it might be good

		to list all the types of horses perhaps in a glossary as

		burroughs did with drugs...there is actually a buzz as if

		i am getting high on my own writing...

		 “You taught me language, and my profit on’t is,
		
		I know how to curse.”

		 
		 

		25 october -

		friday the funeral I did not attend or intend to go to...

		in speaking to the widow about my reasons, the point arose

		in mind's irony...well i had a dream that i was standing

		in a funeral ceremony viewing myself in the coffin...

		i said it was about the age of twelve but most likely it

		was later as it impressed me so that it was among the 

		first attempts at literature...the dream is true however

		the fear of it is not...i stayed up much later than 

		i wanted, getting up several times to make soup and 

		and to make coffee and even again to seduce the hunger

		into submission with a slice of bread...there was an 

		emptiness i could not explain...let us call it an invasion -

		a mystical raid that later even extended into language as a

		foreign song tried to spin around my head...

		it was late morning by the time i got to sleep, the hours

		herein reflect a european time zone - 

		early evening awoke from dreams that found me in a 

		modern building - the office type - i am trying to

		get a pair of shoes fixed and i am told by a woman

		where i could get that done...as i approach the elevator

		it shuts and slides down yet i hear someone say they

		will bring it back which nearly instantly they do as

		i then find myself holding a pair of adidas...it is

		an elevator operator like in a recent instyle story

		reel which lucy was in...i suppose it came to mind

		and there i am with her but it is like a pastry shop

		where i lose sight of her and start unwrapping and

		tasting and returning the sweets to their place wrapped, 
		
		as the voice of some other women recommends, i like the taste

		or perhaps i have not satisfied the weird hunger...

		i think to get some for the widow and the dream ends.

		i had viewed a japanese film, kubi, which is said to be

		about events in 1582...although crowded with bloody

		scenes and even a careless view of homosexuality or 

		if you prefer a degrading view of women
		
		(which should prove shocking enough to most),it still did not

		have that centerpiece alike hellboy the crooked man

		wherein the snake exits the girl's down there parts

		and slithers up into her mouth...the most striking 

		moment was the "delicious" poisoned snapper irony. 

		if only they could have bought dean martin's ain't

		that a kick in the head for the final credits.


		 
		 
                12 november...was it lennon, life is waht happens

		when you are busy making other plans...i did not

		intend to have to wait so long for a dream that

		made sense enough to put place into words...

		although i know the experience as commonplace to

		myself when under the influence of weed wherein

		dreams are so light they carry no weight in memory...

		meanwhile i kept cleaning house...i view'd several

		many more films, most recently thunderball, man woman 

		or teen was that tom jones belting out the theme...

		sean sucking claudine's foot...she was in a genius 

		bikini...in the dream it was evening and within that

		night the rain poured down in storm-fashion...the times

		wroted 'trump storms back' as if it wasnt enough to 

		have stuck their neck out on the silly endorsement they

		seemed to go with a cheap daniels jape...

		i remember i went shopping for a fan - thinking it sort

		of proved that 2020 was replete, filled with fraud...

		people, in the dream scene were running, crowds of them, 

		through the shadow of trees above where i walked which

		was a roadway, a woman was with me as we decided to hail 

		a taxi, japanese contraption spied letting out a customer

		and i got in as the girl vanished - a very little man 

		drove but on the side as one might find in those sidekick

		motorcycle - another man without pickles kept nearing 

		from the front i faced as if searching me for something -

		i searched through sofia's first well second failed film

		which is called priscilla, first girl i ever kissed in 

		some childhood lobby uptown, it starts ramones perfect

		directer by spector but i felt the cast did not resemble

		the reality, even graceland looked like an apartment not

		a mansion, vegas scene was nice, the hinted los angeles

		ending was cool yet like the book burning it didnt capture

		the impact...no elvis songs in the soundtrack sure was

		shocking...yes i know easy to monday morning quarterback
		
		pick apart and yes obviously a great amount of effort

		went into it...hopefully she will get back to form in 

		her next scenes...the driver did not want to go to 

		bella vista and i had to agree to be let out as near

		to my destination as he could manage...i awoke before

		getting anywhere, gabby got published with nowhere, usa

		and i was very happy for her without agreeing that the

		midwest is hell...or even frozen although i know poetic 

		language is what language cannot be...robert graves,

		the white goddess, a reading that makes me feel the 

		limit of my own recall. thousands of stories and 

		connections which are impossible to memorize...

		embraced it awake and held it asleep...one understands

		some of the major points, the intent, let us call it

		the premise...in itself a duality that aims to prove and

		provoke yet in the build up of facts and circumstantial

		evidence there is a dizzy sort of who or what question

		as the whirlwind spins into a series of explorations...

		i agree somewhat - not with the style - but with the 

		concept and feel especially thrilled that there is 

		no pop quiz at the end of this bizarre masterpiece. 

		the jews agree; the body should be buried...the outrun,

		say or see never looked so beautiful yet how could such

		an intelligent character be so dumb? well, drinking 

		does kill brain cells, they say...did love the ending. 

		these are not movie recommendations, merely notes for

		i know not what exactly except by definition as a writer 

		i scribble into the constant illusion of now...

		the past presents itself in emilee form again the run,

		in the book he mentions witches running around a place 

		nine times to cast a spell or the mirror walk behind

		the cursed one so their prat fall results in the stumble -

		there's a little girl, so precious and pretty, i am sure

		it is an illusion but i explain that yes i am keeping

		my promise to the extent that no masked intruder could

		make a fool of me...for a minute i wanted to believe 

		michael was innocent but then i asked myself and even

		ai what other man ever asked to sleep with someone's

		child nevermind the box of porn under the bed...

		ah yes, ready or not - a real modern classic with

		spontanous combustion...dear me i liked that one alot,

		in some ways a sort of documentary i felt for myself

		as i sometimes believe my family has always been out

		to rub out or switch off my dream girl...maternal

		grandmother being the exception, i digress...not meaning

		to have such a word count here dear readers if i have

		any other dream to report you will find it here...

		please note - warner brothers/level is pulling the

		plug on two skinny girls...i could remove the 

		catalog now but why would i? so i am letting it happen

		so it will be on their heads not mine and re-uploading

		the songs after that point. hopefully there won't

		be much downtime but so you know it is not a glitch

		in the streaming services or outlets circa 18 november

		and beyond. 

		 
		 
		
                13 november dream fading upon waking possibly eva green
		
		or lotta stichler, the knit sweater taking longer than
		
		i expected, the idea of twin sister sure is interesting-
		
		not so interesting is the day's unusual diet dessert
		
		flan on top of leftover chinese and two almond cupcakes -
		
		it's like being drowsy drunk on food...fueled with never

		say never again where sean returns to bookend the remake

		i make thoughts on megapolis, as i revist the ending 

		of the white goddess wherein graves gives the devil his due

		as it were...my bath so cold i yelped -

		where was i oh yes this one is not easy, i hope it is

		like depalma scarface which i couldnt understand until a second viewing,

		but i boubt it as this seems to require the faith of an inner child

		yet it is precisely achild in the role of an assassin...

		elvis impersonator felt weird unless one thinks of his daughter -

		my fued with it can be in the sum of two points;

		that lead actress seemed to be pulled from the cast of show girls

		and dud did not transmit emotions required for empathy and

		morpheus stands around as if he had really been killed

		in the apocalypse now boat a walking zombie also doing voice 

		over keeping in mind that he can memorize shakespeare

		it must have been the easiest role he ever learnt

		but if vourse iyt is not a movie...it is a family affair

		 a warning and a prayer with deliverance arrows

		my firs thought was oh no not a happy ending

		sensed tears at the dedication to wife

		once he was going to forget everythint he had learned

		and write like he was a teen, perhaps that is what 

		we have seen...director's cut? classified

		wondering why aaron kept leaving the fire arms released

		along with the extended version of caligula well

		woman of the hour had something, that is how wrong 

		we can be in judging...anyway i was hoping for a 

		sort of youth without youth vibe but maybe next time -

		at least there was a real sense of new york city in

		the apprentice...pre-disney manhattan might have been

		the message in me gap ol is...ford to city drop...

		of course the issue with outstanding acting ie

		the critic is that one starts rooting for the villainous 

		character...irony will drown us all...

		i tear up the picture of the fat man of the week

		tv show interview the dearly departed had done 

		finding it alone in a scrap book never started -

		i play my scales over the film concentrating on

		the gypsy...now thinking that's what dylan called

		elvis staying in a big hotel smiling as he appreached

		saying well well...i try to take a nap but the nap

		takes me further into thinking with the national

		soundtrack of ymca village folk rising in nonsense

		echoing...young mens christian association...

		maybe it will help jerry lee's cousin jimmy...

		maybe i have overdosed on film...certainly

		on porn...some other position postultes 

		god in the volcano or zeus...some of it makes

		sense and it gives me pause...perhaps i have to

		revisit joseph campbell's ideas...tomorrow and

		tomorrow alexander the great is named pharaoh

		but that 332BC, not because but before it's fun

		to stay at the why have we not been there...

		 
		 

		14 november

		i'd felt outside my self all day as if waiting
		
		for the evening and the i'd felt the evening
		
		was not waiting for me...

		they say the berlin ruling system collapsed,
		
		they say dw union is on a two day strike...

		maybe i was locked in a teledisco booth -

		some of the monkeys were given fruit loops...

		in terms of entertainment, i should have mentioned

                finally catching up with the second parts of 

		ahs 12 as well as american horror stories. 

		emma, have i got a story for you concerning

		the ambulance birth...but i didn't get why

		wear the bitch's headgear?

		otherwise i liked the liminal spaces idea

		but i really have an insnae bias against

		blubbler so i could hardly enjoy the 

		last part of the stories which should have

		brought to mind asylum season, yeah i was

		more worried that the buttons of her blouse

		were going to fly off into the the other

		actress's face...

		pre dream pissing on lotta's face...

		walking through the chelsea hotel thinking

		of the brazilian girl i went there with

		willy deville singing to walk that girl home...

		minutes or moments later it's all pretty dark

		and i seem to be without a body hovering or

		hooked up with some woman on amsterdam avenue

		who is upset over the drug dealers that stand

		around in fron of the shop she's trying to 

		get into...i hear the vague outline of her

		voice arguing against them and they seem 

		to be replicas of each other even in the

		way they are dressed...i don't know where

		this dream went - i get up too early but

		take a minute or a moment for cigarettes

		coffee and this note...marian is on my 

		mind as i give skirt the party mix eats...

		there's a text message about a wallet and

		it nearly derails all the details of the

		dreaming but as i type i start to recall

		the strange door dreams, three k where

		i find cheese and nickel bags thinking 

		to snack and go back to my room and puff

		when it sounded like someone was at the

		entrance...other door dream opening but

		then it does not fit like three quarters

		of it only which left a slender opening...

		here door a motley gang of men insisting

		that i am having a soiree and wanting to

		come in and celebrate as i stand there

		baffled and nearly upset...i had lined

		the back door with litre glasses of 

		coca cola bottles, but it was the front

		door. people are strange when you're a

		stranger should have been played.

		seven in the morning sweden, one in the

		morning here, eleven in the evening los

		angeles. this ain't the mud club or cbgb's...

		early afternoon in asian towns, sounds like

		monkey genocide in thailand...valencia might

		re-flood with evacuations underway, i hope

		padam padam is a hit but there is no logical

		way to juggle time zones...

	
		 
		 

		23 november...so much has gone down and yet 

		not much has happened...arrival of guest and

		groovy haul - my habit was to always buy one

		nice shirt when possible but i find myself with

		five new shirts all at once...

		a weird luxury. some rich dreams too yet

		mostly disintegrating as the waking thoughts

		rattle me up to serve breakfast and start the

		day...a few weeks ago i was very happy that

		lucy  was going to film in rome, i think

		where fellini worked out his scenese, and 

		i sure did have a dream wherein we were very

		friendly as if rejoicing yet lotta  had

		gone to new york and mentioned a girl named

		giulia which then made me think it might have

		been her in the dream...not much time for

		sleep as i don't allow my guest to cook or

		clean...but this is no complaint or protest...

		i play the substance everyday, today will be

		the fifth time...in fact i am looking forward 

		to it...there's a week or so left of this 

		"visiting" and i will try to report on the

		proceedings as soon as possible...posed

		one of the "taken down" songs and it was 

		a spirit breaking experience...the cover was

		not accepted since they require very specific

		dimensions, so my lock and key artwork went

		by the wayside for some stock image...then

		the exported catalog is all in wav files but

		this requires mp3 or flac...it was for -low fi-

		and they require at least one foreign language

		metadata and i chose traditional chinese which

		then had to be augmented by simplified chinese...

		i could not imagine doing this for thirty songs...

		would you? the lyrics of it's a long way to the top

		if you want to rock and roll never mentioned such

		tedious work involved in getting one's music out...

		for reference; (low fi) 
 
		the sun drives across my skinq 
sweeter than a nevervous breakdown
breakdown 
nobody in the human race 
is my next of kin 
nah this tan can't camouflage 
my sound

well, stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again did

	sort of say there was some sort of repetition involved

		in the "creative" process; smoking eyelids

		and punched cigarettes...

ashes when i have tray time i will see if there is another

way to get the other songs out in the format they already have...

i listened to it again thinking sure it's not a hit but it is not

run of the mill...usually it's books that go out of print...

to have this happen to songs is beyond bizarre...

sort of like gogol's the nose! 

well, here's wishing you all a decent thanksgiving.  

		27 november...i dreamt yesterday that iwas

		flying to to europe from the states...germany

		i suppose as that is a recurring scene in my

		dream mind...in this case the airport and 

		luggage were all very detailed - someone was 

		speaking as if asking questions, not sure what

		i said...did recall a pre-dream nightmare

		wherein i am talking to my sister as if

		hypnotized...she had actually dropped by -

		then again yesterday with her motley crew...

		went to sleep late smoking and wondering why

		lotta was still in new york...i dreamt playing

		guitar with the stones and trying to figure out

		some song about a feline in the key of c major...

		i got up early feeling tired all day - but it was

		rainy and i rather enjoy the downpour...she got

		miu miu eyewear and was on her way to the plane...

		i actually have not taken the time for notes or

		chords although i did make a leather strap for

		the ibanez...the idea was that not playing my

		daily scales would help her in some way...silly 

		yet it satisfied something in my thoughts...

		or more correctly in my superstition - 

		anyway i am looking ahead to getting back in 

		rhythm tomorrow...besides, in skipping the 

		thanksgiving shingdig, i will have the evening

		all to my self, well myself and skirt...

		had not heard the song flight 505, well five

		days left of hosting after tomorrow  as the 

		guest leaves early on the first week of december.

		word to the wise, don't dare miss say or see 

		singing one of the blitz songs in the studio, 

		it is exceptional or to kick at madonna's nerves

		some; it is neat. 

		 
		30 november...weird watery dream wherein there 

		was a screen embedded into the faucet handel

		of the shower...it resembled one of those

		ancient portable tv screens but smaller...

		invention dream; shower faucets with media 

		screens...

		hmm...then of course i did not have a free

		thanksgiving as my guest decided not to go out -

		at least the lions won...memories of detroit 

		swirled in thought...then further into childhood

		and my jacket...they have never gone all way -

		i really liked that jacket...you gotta lose

		your mind in detroit rock city...billy idol

		covered bob dylan's if not for you, i heard

		grace slick talking and was amazed by her 

		honesty - but how is time magazine ten dollars?

		back to scales, felt no lapse. guest did venture

		out to visit someone else and so i do have part 

		of taday free...in a moment of idk browsed the 

		perlude to moby dick and thought melville had

		influenced me more than i realized...lotta left

		via  gate 65 and arrived, an hour late, via gate

		66...i thought the detail was quirky...lauren 

		got a ritual candle and robyn erased her kill 

		bill halloween pictures which i now miss...

		third day of pizza but my stomach has been sensitive

		for two days...i didn't expect, at this point, any 

		dream recall at all yet last night the scenes were

		pretty particular - as if i had married virginia 

		and one of her children was even calling me daddy...

		then moving into an apartment which was more like 

		a mailbox building or perhaps the locker in the 

		substance where the packages are delivered...

		everything seemed so compact...i always feel this

		place itself is too big for one person but i like

		the options of several rooms...in the one room 

		dream i sensed sister invading thought as she had

		said she was going to an apartment hotel for the

		weekend and when this happens i always wonder which

		one of her known relations has slipped into my place

		as if i were him or the like? well they are scheduled

		to leave on tuesday as well as my guest...
		
                great fun with the story of the fruit vendor who

		sold a banana which was used to make art and then

		eaten by a millionaire...that antique song that

		said bananas have to ripen in a special comes to 

		mind...cheers.
		 
		december one
		 
		sunday - i first heard it within everyone says i love

		you...marshall brickman gone at eighty five...nap

		snapped into song, 'i got a notion to love you 

		all day' heard it as if had already been wroted...

		dream in the park i talk too much and can't think of

		what to say then say, i contain multitudes, which is

		a song that was alredy wroted yet i only have a vague

		memory of it since i concentrated on murder most foul

		and later on key west philosopher pirate...

		this was not intended to segue from herman, but such

		is life...late at night a flood of emotions resolving

		in hunger that made me get up again for bread and

		ironically coffee...awoke minutes before nine - dream

		lotta's mother seemingly setting up lunch or some 

		meal in a very exact way...i'm not sure, but it was

		pretty impressive and for a minute i wondered trying

		to figure out the scene aside from inner intuition 

		what it was about...like a self interview, is she

		telling me something, i usually don't eat much but

		there is no need to set up a table meal, i should

		get up and look after my guest, it seems dark but

		the foil on the windows doesnt let the sun in, if

		it is lotta's mother then why do i feel attracted,

		oh no i am excited, now how am i going to explain this...

		the misfits is on prime. i'm in the middle of grand hotel,

		i've been in the middle of it ever since the guest arrived...

		the list of films was updated but my viewing list is now

		way overdue...nothing can be done about til tuesday...

		 
		monday two december  

		after waking up way too early, i returned to sleep, 

		and woke up a bit late...i'd been thinking about

		presidential pardons and sir elton john's eyes...

		my guest continually invites me to new york...

		i suppose it makes me dream of the city. well,

		the parts that i know...you cannot actually know

		a town like that...every few streets might be 

		like entering a different country...even the

		seemingly empty spaces like tenth avenue on the

		west side or york avenue on the east are entirely

		different types of desolation...one feels industrial

		and the latter feels richly secluded even like a 

		suburb - at least that is my feeling. i suppose

		it was more in the middle, in the mid town area

		perhaps right below columbus circle...i sense the

		crowd and the countless lights, some woman asks me

		if i am drug dealer...i think only dh marks fits

		into that category...how many names bring back 2016...

		too many. i say no, quickly thinking of the ad,

		say no to dr-ugs and hoping that at least some of

		my stories and songs are addictive. meanwhile the

		cinema list has surpassed two thousand five hundred

		titles with additions from the silvia pinal filmography.

		mexican film has not had a good day in years, my favorite

		is el esqueleto de la senora morales...
		 
		december 4. pre departure dream sitting knees up on the
		
		the floor beside the conclusion of some sort of trap-door

		slide where a girl gently crashes into me, i could see she

		had arrived with someone else yet he vanished and we lay

		there with sort of embraced legs, it felt like until i 

		went seemingly backwards into the trap-door and down

		with a falling naked feeling which was suddenly dressed

		and dressed again by what i can only describe as mail

		bag pouches with a much softer material...say they were

		heavy cotton yet these were soft linen with the same 

		sand coloring although neither beige nor tan...

		subsequently my guest left. given that it was mom,

		well, it sure seemed to be her once in a while, i

		felt utterly alone. weird how one can get used to 

		living by one's self yet seeing and serving another

		underlines the desolation, redefines it...ruins the

		illusion of what it means to be content...the girl in

		the scene i thought was kia, in other scenes there

		are other people in the house and mom is cleaning to

		which i react in opposition against the mop...stomping

		on one fellow as if a wrestling match...last night

		dreaming of walking down a road the type that is 

		sleek asphalt yet surrounded by forest...strangers

		gathered, surrounded...for some reason i argued that

		i could not be detained because i needed to get back

		to help mother. i felt danger in the outnumbered

		position like a dying man circled by vultures...

		i cleaned my room which had been neglected for 

		cleaning the rest of the apartment, i learned the

		word semiotics which i don't like and will possibly

		never use in conversation...i learned the chords

		of a song for you and heard the story of how sir

		elton john saved leon russell from the ditch on 

		the road of life...yet it seems he was supposed

		to be a sort of underground giant, i mean even 

		as much music as i hear, i only met his songs

		because i searched out will the circle be unbroken

		once upon a time a few months ago...strange. 

		i suppose bertrand and later kurt possessed the

		name so fully that no one else has a shot with it...

		in a dream i am working and a girl is trying to 

		get me to continue working without pay and in return

		she will flash me her tits fifty thousand times giving

		me an example preview...pink red nipples i could

		hardly remember her face thereafter as she turned

		away leaving me with the image of her chest...a man

		starts speaking perhaps asking if it is a deal but

		i think i only start making excuses...later shopping

		but also sweeping dirt from the floor...something

		is missing from the items i ordered at the last place

		and another woman is shwoing me the options...eight

		o'clock closing in on nine now...my to do list involves
		
		eating, taking out the trash, and laundry...hopefully 
		
		everyone else is gearing up for christmas the only

		x-rated holiday that isn't sexual. 

		  december 5. the reason for a song for you was

		to play it everyday, but in the irony of life it 

		got entwined with my thoughts of mother...

		therefore, i opted for deep elem blues which also

		gives me a lot more options in terms of improvisation

		with lead riffs...i think i have the chords and some

		fills now i need to learn the words...will record it

		when it comes along...took a nap after meal and doing

		what i wanted or needed from my to do things, but then

		i was up late mostly thinking of lotta as if possessed

		by something that was never exact, never explained...

		time swimming like an olympic swimmer into dawn before

		i knew it. nothing in dream thought and it seemed some

		one due to proximity had invaded the scene wherein i am

		standing there listening to a story about how some people

		were living in a stranger's apartment and some other people

		questiong what they would do when the stranger arrived...

		in other words nothing that felt relevant to me...

		yet i note it as i don't make up dreams, maybe it will make

		sense down the line. alliteration in the news, deny defend

		depose, with at least one outlet also employing the word

		divulge...from the fourteenth century etymology ;

		"Middle English, from Anglo-French deposer,
		
		from Late Latin deponere (perfect indicative deposui), 
		
		from Latin, to put down"

		nobody should get shot outside any hotel but i like that

		'depose' is in circulation as it were...oh sweet mamma

		your daddy's got them deposed blues...

		 
		december 6.  i reglimpsed the start of grand hotel, 1932...

		then picked up where i had left it two weeks ago when my

		guest arrived. i will try to note my reaction without 

		spoilers and explain the sensation...there are two aspects,

		i went into it trying to understand greta garbo and then 

		upon watching trying not to mix up barrymore with klein...

		there was also the buzz in my thoughts that brought me to 

		it which was lotta having a family dinner at the grand hotel

		stockholm wearing one of the sweetest sweaters i have ever 

		seen...well there then, this movie is very good and i could 

		nearly understand the gg hype...however no luck with klein

		vs barrymore...still, the emotion overpowers the contrasting

		or rhyming appearance and at a certain point all i was thinking 

		about was the character and maybe the pocketbook...it is one

		of those films to view a few times merely for the fact that

		- as ms hynde sings - they don't make 'em like they used to...

		someone tried to make a production of me throwing out the 

		old sony radio or maybe all my attempts to get to sleep early

		converged into an irony that kept me up late again...

		i sure did dream something, i think now of lauren's neat

		drawers - maybe she got her christmas decorations done -

		i can't say what it was since i awoke sort of hounded by

		someone at the ten oclock hour...did i look too pale?

		why on earth is it that some people cannot simply agree

		to disagree...a line from license to kill resounds in 

		thought, dylan or the management that runs his tweet

		spoke of the film "based" on him or who he used to be...

		myself i refuse to see anything that actor is in since

		a rainy day in new york...because he was so helpful in

		firing up the witchhunt against the director...anyway

		cate blanchett prolly did a better bob in i;m not here

		or was it there...i'm not there...you ain't goin' nowhere...

		seven deadly sins magnitude kaliphornkneeah, they said after

		one man in butte county said to himself hey let me shoot

		at the kindergarden kids meanwhile a falling statue killed an

		eight year old in the next door state...
		
		not a good day to be child in america...

		otherwise i feel good, maybe not in the james brown way,

		yet good enough that if someone tells me to play that funky

		music, white boy, i could or possibly would. now then for

		woody; www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/movies/woody-allen-marshall-brickman-q-and-a.html

		wherein you will learn about the word Anhedonia...

		december 7. pearl harbors before natalia's birthday. i thought about the

		nearly logical thread that ran all the way from that film into london

		boulevard...don't be upset if i didn't mention joan crawford, she will

		be put placed prominently on the list...i viewed the great beauty -

		the opening only confused me and felt as if the director was teasing

		the audience...or like someone reluctant to let in the crowd to see

		the plot...yet it developed nicely...partly eclectic and partly 

		ironic...especially at the end which contains a great gift in the

		form of music; the beatitudes by vladimir martynov. 

		(kronos quartet)
		
		a piece that floats in a space all its own and cannot be contained

		by descriptive words, it has to be heard then one might give it

		an emotional setting upon each individual listen which could run

		the spectrum of several feelings...

		i got up well after noon after a long night thinking about lotta

		as i learned the nine months ago story when she missed a trip

		to portugal...in my dreams i was sitting somewhere where i could

		see the stairs...staring at the stairs instead of stars go figure;

		i hear the explosion that preceeds fire and see a man race up

		as if he had just set the nearby building, which in my dream mind

		i knew to be a drug den, ablaze...i thought well some people can

		never win but coldly as if empathy and myself had lost touch...

		later, certainly even colder, i am sitting elsewhere, trying to

		avoid another man as one of his friends arrive smiling at me

		like i am salvation personified...i don't like these people 

		yet in my dream mind there is a real illumination, a wisdom

		that leaves me miles away from them even as they near then

		one of them mentions not having anyone to help him although

		the other one is still there...i take it as jab at my aloof

		state of mind and for a second i am forced to look at them

		as if there were no stars in the skies only to awake wishing

		i had not had that dream and still feeling the slime of their

		greed as i walked into the hallway to fix the start of the day.

		 
		december 8. i had read that the rebels took Homs and were

		entering Damascus as the dream i didn't note flashed in memory

		where i was either licking or tickling a woman and suddenly

		could not escape the squirting streaming into my face...

		i don't know much, but i do know that cate left her career

		to be with kevin and i havent seen him in anything since

		the christmas balls movie...i then read that assad fled

		syria- luxury cars on display at the telegraph...

		which made me think deny defend depose was pre-coded to

		announce the toppled regime...but i think too much when it

		comes to these things...in my mind what was truly interesting

		was hearing cole porter at stella a life since that is when

		i really felt admiration for kevin yet had not seen barrymore

		uhm so there i was in another film with him in mind well with

		him and elvis costello did let's misbahve on that soundtrack...

		but the film and paula beer is a powerhouse...not to mention

		that it is a true story...my only question with it was the 

		failure to clearly claim the fact that many of the jews were

		also german - some even more so than the "germans" - it is 

		hinted via the lead's father; noted as a war veteran but i 

		felt that irony needed to be fleshed out a bit more. anyway

		to see jews working as gestapo agents in berlin gives such

		a rollercoaster ride of emotions that is like a drug...

		so very high with this film, indeed. STELLA. EIN LEBEN.

		then the shooter outside the hilton hotel and the rebel

		leader were identified in social media and in the press

		although it will most likely not be confirmed until tomorrow -

		i can only confirm that i dreamt of being in another house

		and sighing in the knowledge that the sink could not be used

		while observing someone open the faucet and watching the

		waterworks spill out from the sides and the pour down from

		the ceiling...there was a broken toilet in the corner next

		to the centered toilet...which caught my attention, usually

		there might be a bidet but who knows...so happy to write this

		as in a typo i came up with the word onserving...the cashier

		was onserving coins on the receipt upon the counter...

		in another dream uppermarket, why am i there, i am intent on

		getting exactly three items, cigarettes and two other things

		not as important as marlboros but there is a man with a beer

		belly buying sandwiches and i can see the filled bread and 

		i can feel him stand way too near as he put places his arm

		across my shoulders and starts to sway as if in celebration

		which i cannot understand squirming with a shrug awaking...

		when the ick is onserved one must pick out distance to be 

		preserved...i get up and pick lotta to worship and extend

		the distance from that dream...yet as i do i see froseth 

		pictured with a man eerily like the one in the tuppermarket

		scene. so the two jakes, jack was right. it never goes away.

		ps, bring back spy magazine so i can submit the separated

		at birth photograph of the actor in kiev alongside

		Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani...or as mellish said, I object, your honor!
		
		This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham
		
		of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham...
		 
 <img width="288" height="288" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/woodysanmarcos.jpeg">
		 
		meanwhile i have heard the deposed leader is already in moscow,

		not idaho.
		  
		9 december.  sunday i somehow sidestepped the loud talk outside and

		the man yelling super colmado over and over as i had my pizza and settled

		into blitz with high hopes since i thought the coat song was really 

		special but i can only recomment the soundtrack..cheesier than the pie,

		it pulls at the audience via emotional traps plus put placing lectures

		all along the way as if the viewer needed lessons in social studies...

		it might be the only film to feature a dwarf and still not be worth 

		watching...all mouth and no trousers might well be said of itself...

		if you look at it closely you'll notice say or see asking herself

		what the hell am i doing here...the director supposedly wrote it

		but was it a joke poking at curious george? nobody could write such

		a thing! of course, we all want a perfect society and equality yet

		celluloid like this is more dangerous than helpful...if only the

		producers would now have to take the mta to get around balancing

		the cost of this corny turkey...they hit all the notes but it still

		lacks truth and sounds hollow unlike the lead's fine voice. 

		enoch powell is possibly turning over in his grave...

		i put this all out of mind asap and even managed to get to sleep

		early yet awoke too soon...i dreamt i was drinking although i don't,

		there was some argument and i was wearing a scuba diving suit inside

		a brick walled room that looked like a bunker or basement...i could

		hear someone screaming like i had during the day and stepped out of

		slumber wondering how to get back to sleep but wrote this instead...

		hmm to think i=of it blitz takes place partly in the timeline of

		stell a life, but there is something exceptional in the german

		while the english only has that bit of irish magic to hold it 

		together yet even the magical needs a logical poise.  there is 

		a moment when she is saved from a falling wall left over from

		air raid and hopefully this will be manifested in her career. 

		i love say or see but i did not like this fiasco of manipulation

		and propaganda. 
		 
		december 10. as i squandered most of my day in the secret spaces

		of self reflection, fantasy, and escape i started to feel well

		what hamlet said, i lack advancement...had i never wroted a 

		poem song story novel screenplay...had i never done anything...

		perhaps it was zen or a sartorial stance...i felt empty as in

		devoid of motivation...i did need to go out and was confronted

		by someone telling me he was desperate as one of his something

		or other needed a pint a blood which he claimed cost a lot...

		i tried to be polite but i doubt there was any truth in it...

		as i pondered further, i finally said to myself why am i even

		contemplating this void within...if it is depression then it

		should be respected...to lose parts of oneself is no trivial 

		matter and when it happens in slow motion as it is with aunt

		and mother well there is silent ongoing mourning that cannot

		be explained...so i held myself together saying there is no

		need to hurry past this time...i waited for lotta to post

		but she was at a christmas business party...i kept seeing

		julia wulf on social media and at some point was even tempted

		to write a poem for brooke pufky as i thought back to her 

		extreme kindness and how the world could use love like that

		which instead is focused on her children - but i figure

		one day those kids will be in the world and it will be a 

		better place because of her...when i talked about that film

		which baffled me by its lack of logic, i noticed that is was

		the coin that somehow remained in the hankerchief pocket

		despite the leap from the moving train and further that 

		there is royalty with that name but i don't want to repeat

		myself to myself on these matters...i had glanced at silk 

		and butter - some sort of agency - well silk&butter ug
		
		and in my dream, well there was this very clear vision 
		
		of helena pre-dream as i stretched into sleep, lotta

		saying i never read a poetry book...
		
		i was surrounded by several women

		none of them familiar yet very pretty and well dressed but

		ravenous especially with the butter, we all had bread but

		it made me start to scoop up a bit more butter thinking they

		would leave none for lotta...yes indeed weird given that

		i gave up purchasing the product being that they want

		nearly four dollars for a stick and more when it is a 

		a luxury brand meanwhile the domestic variety is simply

		a greasy disaster...so yeah some prices make no sense,

		bacon here costs more than steak...i had previously awoken

		haunted or hunted by words i had said, i wondered if my

		uncle had died. the thoughts so swift there was no chance

		to distinguish meaning, for example one of his sons is named

		michael yet in mind or memory i instead saw kilmer and then

		thought about how much i liked dylan's version of things

		we said today...yet all this in milliseconds as i awoke 

		leaving behind whatever it was i had dreamt about...

		i went back to sleep and got up in the late morning

		with nothing to report - skirt had two cans of trout

		friskies yet still pressed me for milk...i think now

		it is good enough that i slept easy so why worry if i 

		miss a scene from rapid eye movement. i feel so right

		and logical in this type of thinking because it is true

		and positively should have no need to prove myself

		further...ps, cool minute as joan corrects the daily

		mail over dallas, son volt started playing in mind;

		looking at the world through a windshield...

		much better than the warlord killing a hundred ten

		folks over the voodoo sensation blame or the naked lookalike

		that was too much emilee grant on the heels of having

		thought of her wondering if it was a fake...girls, 

		if you snapchat nudes they might end up on amaleaked...

		or elsewhere - there then now i am going to escape into

		leftover pizza and the heretic - open letter to hugh;

		thank you mister mickey blue eyes but please don't give

		no more cigars to the children or at least consider

		giving them filtered cigarettes if smoking is the point. 

		 
		december 11. there are times when even if it feels nothing

		is going down - or going ahead - there is still or might be

		a sensation that one is where one is meant to be...

		that is what i thought watching heretic...which i would have

		appreciated less before reading robert graves' the white goddess.

		i don't want to get into religion as the facts can't stand

		against faith...i do want to wish for a prequel wherein the

		reed house is decorated and detailed...in any case, this really

		was like taking a drug and it is possible that i am still high

		from it. oh wait back to my point about timing, this one is a

		stretch but allow me to play with the thought...so after 

		my george rant, this picture signals the landlord game which

		i learn was created to make people aware of georgism...

		thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant 

		present and i feel now the future in the instant...

		please note it is a horror film although the golden globes

		might tell you later it is a comedy or musical...

		let me move on, further into now...or then to be precise,

		i have gone to sleep twice, the first time as i drifted away

		into what i am terming pre-dream state, i heard a clear

		bit of conversation where someone was trying to edit a book

		of mine, it sounded like a suggestion but also like someone

		pretending to be writing it...pretty upsetting for a writer

		to ponder if there is a rewrite happening without his 

		consent...who knows? perhaps it was an anxiety from the 

		film...by the way if you stay for the credits you will find

		the disclaimer that no generative artificial intelligence

		was used to create this a24 production...i went to work

		on the cinema list and exceeded my expectations although

		i have yet to update the synonym site...when i finally

		got to dreams, i was surprised to see lotta since i usually

		don't dream of her even if very often in my thoughts and

		musings...i can't recall the scene exactly yet i remember

		thinking how beautiful she looked therein as if really

		seeing her. so bright, so right. i left dreams and 

		felt determined to sort out a meal plan and get the kitchen
		
		in order yet i got into this scribble jot note awith

		coffee and cigarette and suddenly feel like writing a bit

		more - or at least thinking about putting pen to paper

		as it were except it is too soon as my horse novel is still

		being settled and i sense that the white goddess deserves 

		another run through simply to get to missed secrets in the

		clutter of connections...so many names and myths...wednesday

		well i have the fuck kill or marry film yet no idea if the kitchen

		will succeed or what to cook...
		 
		12 december. did the kitchen while listening to the haunting of

		hill house by shirley jackson which i liked more than expected...

		i found that pretending the cleaning was for someone else made it

		all easier...as for the film, well you couldn't really call it a

		film since it was a sort of sitcom where you could tell which 

		places the commercials would go...a strange pilot that puts place

		a woman in a position to date while a serial killer is hunting

		dating women...exasperating? well, maybe insane. i felt awful

		for lucy, it seemed to me she had some success in recent movies

		and might possibly be sort of upgraded but here she is with

		motley crew of wanna be leading men which only bring her down

		to their level...a sort of b-movie straight to video on demand

		type...i think the popular term now is cringe...i blame the

		abc seven year run as she ends up with the ags guy a sort of

		carboard cut out with a beard...yes i know comedy is very 

		difficult to pull off but to not have one good laugh makes

		it feel as if a hatchet job to sideline ms hale to the ranks

		of john ritter - southworth - although he did manage to be

		in bad santa before the end...i'd have to look up what the

		failed show called life with lucy was about if this were

		to be an essay...it ain't. still a third film adaptation

		of THOHH in slapstick style would've made more sense...

		i mean if you have a split personality comedy/horror then

		the source material should be something worth it. 

		"Don't do it - Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your

		cup of stars, once they have trapped you into being like

		everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again..."

		see how good that writing is...too good. well, maybe they

		thought the title was powerful enough, but this was 

		very far from being the tits.  my apologies to elisabeth

		moss for always thinking of her when i think of shirley 

		jackson. now then, the book along with lotta's hello 

		fresh video helped me displace that film, dispose of it

		as i wondered why there are so few blue cars around...

		i played my scales and ran through deep elem blues...

		but got caught up for hours trying to figure out how

		to judge the death of the last survivor of the kamikaze

		attack and make it rain in malibu...when i did sleep,

		i thought i was with lotta yet i am nearly sure it

		was inka and we were laying upon some road where a

		stones played we were both singing along but i only

		heard her voice as i missed some of the words then 

		we walked into a theater, the ancient type i guess

		you'd call it ampitheater...i awoke then wondering

		if i had dreamt of williams or stichler...most likely

		williams who subsequently spoke of the stupidity of

		people on the roads in baliland...why are the b- shoes

		so good, bally's - bruno magli - she was featured in 

		an arabian magazine and i am happy for her although

		the dream sort of baffles me...i have a wish for 

		crocodile shoes now that i have seen them in saks,

		if only to dance to elton's crocodile rock...lalalalaaaaa...

		it is not entirely a serious wish, call it a whim...

		but it is like those overpriced watches, i'd rather

		spend that type of money on guitars...where was i not

		strumming in another dream, jennifer is there and i

		don't think we spoke much except maybe about white 

		boy rick which i liked alot and believe to be a 

		true story if memory serves...it;s noon time or

		midnight in asia and the lights went out derailing

		my train of thought which switched to boulder colorado...

		where that fuck marry kill was set, no wonder the 

		fraternity news said six students had overdosed...

		disembodied poetics, perhaps it's time to review

		the burroughs' lucktures from nairopa...craig

		is getting raves for his performance and i am 

		secretly hoping he will pull the sean connery

		return stunt somewhere down the line as bond. 

		spies used to be termed ghosts so it might

		still make sense... meanwhile i am reluctantly going to check out

		'emilia perez' not that i listen to hype but

		so i can see for myself...hey, selena, continued success

		to you.

		 
		13 december. well that was really something out of the

		ordinary...conversational songs that were not trite

		for the most part, yeah for the most part there is 

		nothing to complain about here except it did not 

		make sense for a person in hiding, or even simply

		trying to turn a new leaf, to go into the limelight...

		but i see how it added tension...so i liked it even

		if i protest the newsy interviews of the protagonist.

		cheers or bravo...hmm, i am writing this about an hour

		after going to sleep...it is still the wee hours but

		my dream was so weird that it delivered a jolt as it were;

		there is a gathering of people in the living room and 

		i don't like one of the men there but i go to bed

		after feeding skirt who was wounded in the scene

		and i had to lift him up for the plate noticing there

		a flattened sort of foreleg paw, in my thinking i 

		chalk it up to the kids running around carelessly

		as it seems there were also children then as if reflecting

		or foreshadowing itself i get up from bed quickly dressing

		intent on kicking out the man i dislike, as i dress i can 

		hear mother agreeing to go to the shop and return to cook

		some sort of meal which she is excited over, i grab the 

		keys and make my way down the hall - on the kitchen counter

		a record is playing, vinyl, i want to love you night and day

		it is singing in a doowoop style heavy on the vocals, male

		vocals, i had been wondering how could i see myself and for

		a second worried about some recording device in the apartment,

		i start telling no one in particular that that man cannot be

		in my house while reaching to shut off the spinning song -

		i get up shocked that only minutes have transpired...i take

		out the trash still confused by the crowd in a dream within

		the place that contains only myself and skirt...the sensation

		was frightening as i felt it was something urgent yes like

		blood rushing to the head yet there is atruth contained in

		it and that is that there are people who i avoid based on

		some instinct, some perception, some inner wisdom which

		has served me well. catching my breath as it were, i 

		wonder if robert graves was right that the white goddess

		will haunt the poet until his muse is properly satisfied...

		will battle against his distractions and even his wealth

		to keep the need or desire to exceed his own verses...

		i listen to another chapter of the haunting of hill house

		but i am thinking more about lotta than the narrative...

		a lot more in fact.

		 
		14 december. the inclination or inspiration to write

		is with me yet i pause trying to decide which dream

		or thought to put place first...first place put the

		misfits, i had for years wanted to ear it and hear

		what it would yield, to see it and wear what it would

		yield...once upon a time, when i wrote the biographical

		story entitled baptism by desire, i visited a book shop

		where there was only one tome on clift and where the 

		clerk said why not ask eli wallach...i didn't realize

		he lived nearby although some time later i saw him

		while we both walked west end avenue but i was

		done with the story by then and i'm not one to 

		intrude...but the point is i went into the misfits

		last night...it's a good time too since back then 

		i would only have thought of clark gable as the 

		gone with the wind character unaware of his past,

		his genius past - i could say the same for john huston,

		which would only have registered as prizzi's honor but

		now especailly after seeing 1960s unforgiven there is 

		a more complete sense of what it means...still it wasn't

		the men...it was marilyn  and it was alot more monroe

		than say monkey business which is where i saw her last -

		now all the hoopla makes sense to me and i'm really excited

		to see the rest of it and to a lesser extent dirty angels...

		i wonder if this is the one where eva had to go through a 

		lawsuit...i wonder what wild stories john huston told

		arthur miller on the set of that production...correction

		i might have recalled that director as an actor in chinatown.

		sometime before that significant evening for myself, i had

		a point of confusion as to the brand of jacket lotta wore...

		in thinking of zara or mango i thought of saramago the scribe

		of 'blindness' and illustrated the uncertainty in commentized 

		form...i only bring it up because a minute ago the news reports

		the founder of mango fell off a cliff...for the obvious reason,

		i thought it weird but also for the fact that i thought mango

		was by penelope;s sister...night and the middle of the night hours

		crawled by lazy after a terrbily breezy day...turbo ily shadows

		while listening to the haunting of hill house...telegraph said

		cherry hill who would take up to seven years to build toy scale

		model steam trains had rolled on into what must be an intricate

		afterlife...theodora is not the easiest name for me to hear...

		then too the narrator when playing the professor sounds exactly

		like christopher waltz...listening to the dead play cold rain

		and snow...i'm going where those chilly winds don't blow...

		well literally this late morning although still not seeing

		the sky in dream i had this sensational adventure with lotta

		as if meeting her at the station, the one in sweden, although

		she is presently ingermany, yes it didn't feel cold or windy -

		like a man in a trance enchanted...i awoke amazed and even 

		after the post-rem slumber it remained with me so that i still

		feel elated...i'm sure you know the feeling wherein nothing

		else matters much so that for a minute or so life makes sense.

		i suppose it was the setting since there was only conversation

		while we made our way around...i've heard it often, location

		is everything but now i'm a believer. i can't believe west sofia

		started a gym, well pilates workout place...it's called reform

		avenue...here's wishing her well...very well then, alexandra

		seemed to insist on something in my imagination yet i could not

		decipher it - of course, being me i worry a bit although i know

		worrying is no help - i now think of ester exposito...yet my

		instinct was that someone was trying to invade her while 

		pretending to be me as i had not had such a bizarre and 

		forceful series of thoughts...in fact with alexandra it was

		and hopefully is always extremely pleasant and helpful in 

		the sense that she is the only person to ever make me 

		consider the importance of washing my face...the other

		day i was shocked at the dirt on the dickinson's witch

		hazel towel as i scrubbed my mug and thought of her with

		that oh you were so right in that sense...anyway subsequent

		to where i was i drifted away from worry which for a second

		turned bottomless with the previous concern of when her

		shift shipped her out to deliver a few months ago...yet 

		as i consider it now the contrast of those worries was 

		like night and day...perhaps it was all overthinking yet

		i certainly felt an undefined pressure as i drifted further

		away into sleep...i say all this because everyone is important

		in their right and especially girls need more safety in our

		illogical meat grinder rat race society...methinks, meanwhile

		i fully support sonia taking over pinsk and for that matter

		all of belarus...ah yes, that was the last time i dreamt of

		the sky. sigh. yes i know too much information but blame the

		tmi on the swedish dream that is still making me feel magical

		although i pulled no rabbit out of this convoluted paragraph

		hat.
		 
		15 december. the john huston film from 1960 did not disappoint,

		in fact i felt it went above and beyond what anyone would have

		or could expect...my high praise however stems from the inspiration

		i found in learning about horses...he actually entered a camel

		race in the middle of directing that movie and came in first

		place...i think of mia in tracks now which also featured a 

		dog, here it was tom dooley...character from a folk song...

		well, there was something poetic and poignant as the female

		lead stood on the plains away from the men calling them 

		murderers as if a ghost of herself foreshadowing her own

		spirit;s rant upon her death august fourth of the next

		year...they had wrapped november fourth...i could be a 

		critic against montgomery's performance yet having 

		studied his life and knowing he did suffer a horrific

		car crash only a few years previous it only made me 

		grimace and in some ways cheer for him even if i didn't

		feel any emotion other than curiosity from his performance,

		but i'd expect nerves would have played a part...

		it was two in the morning euro time and lotta was still

		editing her video...i went to sleep at three yet awoke

		at five...i dreamt i was in a bed sideways on the 

		lower side opposite the headboard - there was a girl 

		under the sheets i could not see yet felt like a friend,

		mother climbed into bed and she tickled her toes until

		mother covered them then we started holding hands, the

		girl and myself as mother started to speak about me getting

		married which led to my wisecrack that tiffany wanted to 

		marry me wherein suddenly i could see tiffany in the city

		riding a bike, a purse on the handlebars which she was adjusting

		and this shift in time and space felt entirely natural - 

		i get up to pee in the dream and the girl follows, the house

		i recognize as aunt's laly old house on castillo 36 - 

		i stand by the kitchen door which i have just opened yet

		the desire to pee has left me as i look at the view which

		contradicts location...there was only a guava tree back there

		yet in the dream housing buildings stood with some windows lit -

		the locks are interlaced pads and chains and ionly used the bolt

		leaving the mystery for someone else to figure out - the girl

		now wants to pee - but other family has arrived, one of them

		taking the bathroom perhaps for a bath...well shower since there

		was never a bathtub in that house - i think for a second it's

		kia jade yet i believe she's taller...we make our way into 

		the front porch where another aunt is dressed in white and red

		in fact they all were - one of the boys even seemed to be wearing

		a dress - i say it is like the so-called gypsy roma people and

		turning away from the sour faced cousin in the dress i start singing

		here comes the bride heading back inside finding myself between two

		ladies i do not recognize but one of them is really singing the song

		in full emotional voice, she reminds me for a second of lotta's mom

		but i do not know if she can carry a tune actually, in any case i turn

		to the other lady that i somehow know is a singer and mention how well

		the other lady is belting it out...i suppose i turn to finally see who

		i am with but awake in that very moment...moodys downgraded the french

		credit score and mayotte was battered by a cyclone...although bowie

		took up most of the space in me that would grieve over the loss of 

		a loved one, as i looked at van morrison and sinead oconner's duet of

		have i told you lately on the letterman show i could see vm's antics

		bring out the true sinead and in an instant one understands her

		contradition which was both shy yet outspoken, nervous yet filled

		with admiration and desire to bring joy to the world - indeed it

		was an angel we all lost too soon...so i say to contrast with

		my thoughts spurred on by the dream as to how much northern

		land the french side of my family gave up for the sake of 

		not going to paris...or more importantly who were the ones that

		left it...i miss that house, i miss all the houses that are no 

		longer ours...they were true homes even now in dreams like

		apartment 3k is and will be...but feeling i went over board 

		writing these notes yesterday i will leave it at that for now. 

		 
		post-script - well i can't say i entirely understood dirty

		angels, i mean it starts with eva green being stoned which

		gave me perhaps too much to think about...from religion to

		rainy day women...then that bloody shot of her swollen face,

		this is not the lawsuit film as that was never made, ie the

		lawsuit she won a few months ago...where was i - ah yes

		then in uniform - i really liked that - i even started

		thinking we should all wear military outfits...so an action

		film and in that sense it was all right...indeed, it kept

		me watching. my only protest here is the chosen song which

		leads into the fade out credits...some bland heavy metal

		which leaves you thinking what song is that...meybe they

		thought any rock would do to come full circle with the 

		thrown stones at the start...yes i am glossing over the
		
		importance of the political side but one peek at the news
		
		will tell you how timely it is...i haven't heard of any 

		upcoming eva green projects yet i hope there are some soon.

		meanwhile  i have secured 'maria' yet it all seems so quick;

		it really feels like a few days there was an article with

		angelina jolie in oversized glasses that said she was filming...

		how could it be cut and edited and released so swiftly...

		i went to sleep again after viewing lotta's vlog and i 

		was very happy to see her so full of joy...my dreams

		flew by in a flash and i awoke to an even happier lotta

		which made me update the landing page at inkrealm.info...

		skirt has, after clawing through the leather kitchen chair,

		taken to hanging out on the dining table...so will i be

		eating in bed? he's already used up the chair part of the

		ottoman set and now rarely takes to it...like a playboy

		except it's furniture instead of women...this was an 

		unexpectly eventful sunday - well it still is, even in

		european hours there are three left, while here there

		are seven or eight left...
		 
		16 december. i viewed 'maria' however i don't want to

		write about it...it tells so many stories all at once

		while actually reincarnating the voice of callas and

		vividly revealing the isolation that goes hand in hand

		with fame, (although some might argue that her hallucinations

		were due to drugs) that to speak of it even in praise

		could not serve it. it was early morning in asia

		when i went to sleep exhausted for no specific reason

		other than perhaps oversleeping...my thoughts curved

		between lotta and lauren sophia...i dreamt i was walking

		home, yet the new york city version, checking the mail

		where rows of mailboxes were missing as i went into the

		other side finding some old people with no answer as 

		to why it was like that...glass door sassy woman looked

		me over as i walked upstairs...key at the door turning

		as a man approaches intent on talking about some concert

		it seemed he knew i had gone too as well, not so many

		russians this time, he smirks and i say nothing and 

		i still remain silent as he insists on entering until

		i push him out and start to shut the door...marian 

		is inside and somehow this seems normal to me...two 

		of her friends then knock on the door and tell me

		their names, i repeat the names to her and she says

		she doesn't want to be with them, i take it that

		she is tired and relate the message offering to 

		pay for their taxi...marian gives me an 828 number

		and they give me an address in queens...for a minute

		the scene settles into only us yet quickly turns

		to us walking in a part od town that is a cross

		between the village and central park west...for

		some reason lotta is now with marian and showing

		her some kind of way to walk, i suppose it is 

		something models do...they seem to get along 

		better than with me...i am sort of pleased and

		happy that they are happy as i walk up central 

		park west, then lotta climbs up on me from behind

		making me go into a run and there i am running

		yet a few strides in i feel her leg and notice 

		she is not wearing shoes...this starts to wake me

		and i get up with my touch having got to her thigh...

		i am thinking of L'amour est un oiseau rebelle and 

		how she mentioned two girls had showed up in dusseldorf

		and perhaps that was what the dream was about but i am

		not certain what she meant, that is, it was german and

		it seemed to imply fangirls or some recognition from 

		what i understood...as i think of it more i suppose

		she is concerned over the meeting tomorrow promoting

		hejgreta...i know iwould be as a lot of company's make

		these events without too much thought about security...

		i remember being shocked at lara taking a taxi and making

		her way through the street and crowd to get to one...

		hmm, or worse lila wearing wings in midtown manhattan

		struggling through pedestrians along with other models...

		and those were big name fashion houses that could surely

		afford something better for their girls...oh wait this

		has gotten into an overboard groove and in technical 

		terms it is still yesterday here although lunch time

		in asian cities.
		 
		17 december. in a dream i seem to have gone out with 

		only a blanket swirled around my body and for some

		reason i walk into a bakery shop  or is it more correct

		to call it a pastry shop...i thought about that pierre

		shop in wagen...it would take me while to see all the 

		pretty places i want to experience in germany...my 

		cousin would often awake like that, with the blanket

		instead of clothes...a modern day linus without the 

		piano or thumb sucking...i myself have raced to the 

		ringing phone dressed like that but only to not 

		stand naked in the living room...i decided to disregard

		the constant flow of news although i did take a stand on

		djerf wondering why women are trying to tear down a woman

		that carved out a place for herself in an impossible atmosphere...

		give em hell, matilda...yes this is partly because lotta

		likes that fashion but also i don't like the trial without

		due process or jury...that being the case i wont commentize

		on venom the last dance since i missed the second film of

		that movie trilogy...where was i...ah yes so i got a lot

		done even trimmed my toe nails...no news isnt good news

		yet it leaves a bit more space for self...i did glance

		at the wisconsin situation twice given that the star 

		of that sitcom was named natalie samantha rupnow, 

		a woman, well, a girl...amazing...i had not heard

		of female mass murderers...massage place with that

		name 2053 Detlor Rd, L'Amable, ON K0L 1C0, Canada...

		dennis thomas rupnow passed away 28 october '23,

		david ernst rupnow 4 january '22...not a common

		name but several other obits - not sure if any relate

		to her...a kid in the second grade telephoned the 

		report to authorities...honda made the nsr500 until

		2002...there are at least two agencies with the 

		abbreviation of NSR...i will peek later to see if 

		anything more might be said over this tragic or sad

		turn of events...such a nice place, madison wis...

		wish dream resulted in weird dream as mother

		was here again having let in some people that moved

		things around and so i argued until things were in

		place then in the balcony an old man had put an even

		older woman in a sort of brenda lien call of cuteness

		cat sock and i put both out into the staircase all the 

		while asking who was who as the man responded...salami

		people the size of plantains...a lot of it in spanish

		so i suspect the result of an onlooker...my right foot

		in a slow painful spasm as if i had actually been racing

		around putting the place in order...she keeps saying

		she gets up thinking she is here or that she has dreamt

		about being here...i had no idea i was such a pleasant

		host...i do have an idea that printing these notes

		looks as if it were writing yet it is not...it's not

		that i am not considering readers, no, it is more like

		what i do with musical scales...a ritual except here

		there's nothing to contain a random thought and dreams

		well, dreams are what they are...hopefully as might be

		the case in mastering notes, these unedited paragraphs

		will serve as a base or starting point for other projects...

		i'm not promising, only saying. that being said, i will

		try to be more concise down the line.
		 
		31 december 
		 
		dream at one of my machines - there is an alert 
		to review and back up files...i suppose the 
		obituary people are all upset as they were 
		about to wrap the year in a bow never as goodly
		as paris hilton red -there goes the grand theft
		president! not that i didn't think he'd been
		long gone for a while now - not that i didn't
		think highly of him - not as highly as willie
		nelson smoking roof - men in atlanta tryin'
		to pass for...four in the morning, mourning?
		azer - kor - eth...deadly week and to ship
		a gretsch from amazon cost the self same 
		price as the axe - i ask how...well nevermind,
		no reference to nirvana...the albino was 
		julian, libido was electric guitars, mosque-
		toe must;ve been some cousin i kissed -
		no i could not entirely escape the newsy 
		escapades -hmm gl maketh espada hh...
		i made a list of wish guitars, not that
		one...well then it seems i have a lot of
		proverbial ground to cover since sexy
		and seventeen...how many days was that -
		that was days many how...now i am not sure
		how to skip into the start, to slide into
		the past while keeping an eye on the future...
		oh yes obviously, i augmented the scale exercise
		with two new ones...which is what i wanted to 
		do upon waking but i was running out of space
		on the jot pad where upon i scribbled notes
		to make way for this passage - let's see...
		in no particular order - lotta dream conversation
		except i saw her here at the foot of my bed -
		i recall stringing out a joke which may have
                been politically incorrect well racist to simplify
		matters, and suddenly she punched me in the belly...
		i get up in between a smile and confusion...no 
		confusion over the order - a film that exceeds
		itself...i think the crucial point, aside from the
		amazing king craft on display and the several 
		shocks especially if you happened to know bm, is that
		the white power movement has been so silenced as to 
		make it perhaps more alluring in that reverse psychology
		manner that often works its way through irony i guess -
		when speaking about it i automatically equated what
		could potentially be a martyr in that movement with
		the genocide of native americans, how is the day of
		the rope any different from the goal of the calvary...
		well, i digress but back then i got to thinking about
		the whole jew blood libel hype...i wondered how could
		a 'thing' like that be sustained on mere whispers?
		i had to come to my own conclusions which i will
		retain away from the arena of these notes for the
		sake of fairness or at least to give myself time to
		actually consider any contradictions in my logic - 
		i do have a theory, but we can all agree it is a
		sensitive and rare matter...well, done i say to myself
		in secret feeling i have covered the pros and cons of
		the bases...standing on the plate i pitch myself a dream
		rib eye steak like i used to have with anya -there is
		a bare ass girl which i don't think i have seen in dreams -
		yeah usually it's the front side...i woke up thinking of
		miss mcderby bending over extremely near what was my 
		school face then she turned with a blushing smile sorry
		to which i think i only raised eyebrows grin like it's
		nothing to me hell i was not even reminded of being 
		birthed...back in the dream a girl is moving on the bed
		in snake fashion and suddenly pill prescription bottles
		are going into her upwards where the sun don't shine - 
		yes i have lived a couple of lifetimes simply wandering
		about myself around myself at the end of twenty twenty
		four, it already feels like forty years in the desert,
		some of the jottings don't mosey along, same school
		the principal says that type of handwriting means you 
		are cheap...i spend other lifetimes giving gifts to 
		complete strangers to prove him wrong...more recently 
		going in the opposite direction...mr prohartchin...
		one of the books i poured into my ear...still not
		sure if there was a sister in law or not, knots
		memory alivia like a flash bulb leading me to dream
		that emilee is pulling worms from her herself as i 
		hesitate to use the word pussy - well they looked 
		more like roots one might find in the ground...it 
		haunted me some...i wondered if it had anything
		to do with re-reading notes from underground...
		not what i remembered or possibly my state of mind 
		is more content for i thought the second part
		was hilarious..."simonov was positively surprised
		at my turning up"...not the putting down of liza...
		it was my second or even third dream recently of
		miss grant and i'd been thinking it was like saying
		simonov aloud might make one think it's semenov so 
		that lotta's sibling being emil, which once anyway
		sounded to me like email, might make for this dream
		irony...obviously sound makes a difference, it struck
		me last night as the 'colmado' exterior voiced resounded
		and then returned that the root cannot tell which way
		it will go...el colmado question mark buzz no buzzer
		but shout it out loud...even thinking of it now derails
		the writing - twilight zone - ah yes i even dreamed
		of a delivery but that was pizza as if watching it
		from the porch looking down onto the avenue...dear
		putin please win but don't bomb lviv as west sofia
		has set up a pilates place therein...party scene
		large house or hotel suite girl with me entwined
		just like that other sitting dream huh yeah somewhere
		yet herein i get up notice a room full men laying
		on the floor all erect like the dead kennedy poster
		come to life with hard ons reaching for something,
		for someone ? i continue into another bedroom
		and i see tom with several women on the bed motions
		me to join i rest there with the entwined girl you 
		would say it is weird but i will awake and explain 
		that i had viewed rock of ages - back in the dream
		i get up and head to the kitchen where i start eating
		rice but more is cooking the blonde is serving -
		some plates have beans...i think of one of my lyrics
		"uptown they like their rice frijolin"...i forget which
		song its from when i rise from the dream i feel dirty
		yet also concerned over suri...not yet making the 
		connection to the movie with the monkey...well there
		were several other films too, best one was the german
		'sleep' - storm over lisbon was mediocre yet in parts
		memorable, idiot;s delight...early clark gable, over the
		top peace protest yet a haunting ending...anora i felt
		was cheap in contrast to all souls...btw that was an
		excellent font in the end credits...really cute kid in
		that making her debut...here's wishing her well. 
		no easy transition from child actor to actor if that
		is or will be the case...very few guitars come with
		cases - some people in a dream are mourning phil -
		i try for empathy not having much room for defining
		the meaning after bowie...i bow to inka baffled by
		the following dream...the huffing and puffing is
		real...no flashing lights in my eyes - she's next
		me like some sort of magic spell, telling me she
		loves me - we are smoking a joint that is weed
                i wonder over the saliva not knowing if it was
		her or me...a song is playing far away, 'just
		the way we used to' which i had not heard before -
		the time before i looked her up seeing she had just
		arrived from a trip...was i tripping, in another
		dream yes one of the flights leaves at one thirty
		and i suppose i am trying to make it yet i meet
		a girl in a hotel twice then waking up before flying -
		mother continually repeats that she dreamt she was
		here with me and the cat - after dozens of times i 
		dream of her with dalva visiting, i am holding a
		bottle of bailey's irish cream - father at the door
		with some stranger i push them both into a corner
		easily as they are drunken...i ask mom to select the
		goblets for her drink, in the cabinet i see gold
		trimmed snoopy glasses - i seem to be in a hurry - 
		i get up feeling someone is trying to kill me, not
		paranoid but feeling pushed into the land of the
		deceased...twice dreamt aunt's house...weird man
		'interviewing' mom...i had been reading haunted
		hill house and i felt the prose falter here and there
		yet as it concluded i recalled one of my cousins
		had a house in a place called portal which holds a
		bit longer pronounciation outside of english...anyway
		i can't say that place was haunted but there certainly
		was some sort of possessive spirit...it took hold of
		dad once upon a time and most memorable was the instance
		which it took hold of that cousin in question...he awoke
		driving in his underwear entirely beyond sleep walking,
		slumber driving...i mean if it happens to one person
		you'd argue what it was but as it transpired to a couple
		of people a couple of times...well, shirley jackson's
		fiction cannot be simply defined or dismissed...
		indeed the very story led then to binge watching 
		the veil which i do not hesitate to recommend - neat 
		blazing action sequence akin to slow horses...intense.
		as if in a spy world and isnt it? i also binged on
		liaison but one of the characters reminded me of the
		train station slasher which made me uneasy although
		i will say that every once in a while i felt as if i
		was actually in france for the way the city was
		presented...in separate scenes i was viewing dance
		videos but picking at my skin as if mucus from nose
		with a sense of disgust and then worry that i was being
		watched...pretty news lady friendly in the maria luisa
		manner...it's been too long since i;ve been in italy -
		pasta with her felt divine - other self dream found me
		staring at my face but liking that my eyes didn't look 
		so puffy...cure for bags...sunglasses...please don't
		hit me lotta...dream of lotta showing me pictures in 
		a slide motion like one scrolls on social media except
		these were none of the ones i've seen her post...dream again
		simply standing in front of me - i suppose i would share
		my olives with her...olivia led me to india which led 
		me to 'look away' an above average reel with a very
		clever maria/airam mirror image angle...of course she
		is awful pretty so i would have to see it again to say
		anything as i kept thinking how beautiful sometimes
		or how she looked too young for such an extreme film -
		i suspect she was twenty two or so but looked twelve
		in some places...previously bizarre uncle and other cousin
		dream where there is talk of radames being dead, i only
		have a vague idea of who that might have been and none
		as to his living status...it's an apartment but past the
		hallway which i traverse having to squeeze by a man i 
		do not know, perhaps radames...there is a cash register
		without buttons yet opens with all the usual components
		and cash more like euros than dollars...there seems to be
		no system to it...it seems to be about a bag of cement...
		there is a white car outside right at the entrance door...
		years ago i seem to have a notion that there was a joke
		equating cement with semen...i thought then it was merely
		the sound like word play...when i heard men speak of it,
		then much more recently i connected cement with a more
		devious connotation as in a woman being cemented which 
		i figure could have several meanings and is not well
		not that i know of related to walks of fame squares...
		speaking of squares...boxes, in guitar search aftermath
		i dream beatles, well paul possibly - but then a sort
		of warehouse with hundreds of them...a couple of guys 
		are throwing them down below...i doubt anyone has ever 
		counted how many guitars exist...no walrus - i will
		be thanking kramer next month...i thank my muses now
		dear me only a few hours before it's twenty five in
		asian cities meat i made it so good but the next day 
		it tasted like alpo...switzerland is my bucket list,
		i'm not really upset at juliette...i thought ralph was
		on point in the return - like a slow poem that spins
		a wicked wisdom...why did i return to these notes now,
		well in case ms haas asks over my vision board...i
		didn't want my club sandwich christmas to be a point
		of discussion- afire, well no i didn't like that one. 
		although it made me realize i didn't know what oncology
		meant...it only reminded me of the old timer bullies
		that made you say uncle while stepping on some part of
		your body...oh wait in that wormy roots dream there
		was a very specific stereo the type with two big speakers
		on either side...music coming from it like u2 but i hear
		my voice...a bit low on the mix it seemed while trying
		to tempt other versions via the equalizer...'we are one
		but we're not the same'...sequence prayer for Beate
		Zschaepe - i still believe she was railroaded. in a dream
		with another german i awake partly alarmed by the words
		'grave foundation'...i am going to spend the last day of
		the year with the phantom for park so dam...
		너도 새해 복 많이 받아
		 
		1 january 
		 
		2025. so damn happy i picked that so dam film...it was
		magnificent. taking its time with twists and turns then
		bringing it all back home with bang...i made a lipton
		noodle thing a bit concerned over the amount of salt -
		last time it was too much, but i got it so right that
		for the first time ever there were no leftovers in 
		the pot...yum. 
		i don't really have any dream to report, i think i 
		dreamt of one my aunts but i did not retain the facts...
		it's still six in the morning here but i've done
		everything i wanted to do for the day...in terms of
		scales and updating the film list...i have an inclination
		to tidy up the kitchen and should get to that although
		it is no way to kick off the new year...
		let's see how that goes...wednesday huh...
		well, in case anyone cared to know; 
		my guitars of choice are the ibanez roadstar and
		martin acoustic, i have a classical model which 
		have not met and the kramer now on the way...
		my wish ones are the gretsch...i thought maybe
		the nick 13 but it has a drawing on the pick
		guard along with extra letters on the top so
		i crossed that out but still one of the g5s
		is what i'm thinking...then one of the schecter's
		which i like actually for the back of it...
		further away are the reverend flying v and the
		gibson voodoo v...i'm attracted to some eastwood
		models, and finally flaxwood which is a finland
		maker that has nice telecaster types and something
		called laine series...i've had fenders in the
		past but i don't think i am willing to pay for
		one at this point...i like the john 5
		signature series as well the the triplecaster
		put out with jack white but for that kind of money
		i would opt for a 90s bc rich...well i will leave 
		it at that since i find i can easily spend hours simply
		looking at pictures of guitars and if i carry on
		there will be no chance for the kitchen clean up. cheers.

		2 january 
		 
		i think i might like the deadwood guitar co model
		called the revival yet i hesitate to list it...
		i'd have to see if they provide cases like 
		voodoo custom guitars...the kitchen was more or
		less done except for the dishes in the fridge...
		i got up around midnight wondering if i should
		put place that music man axe i like along with
		the others or even the carry on blackstar which
		has a star on the headstock that reminds me of
		bowie and heineken...uhm the mm is the st vincent
		model...although bilt's ultra zaftig might 
		be a nicer choice...by the way if you are wondering
		how i find certain types; instead of searching
		for a general return of guitar makers - which will
		only bring up the main and cheap brands - you 
		search for guitar makers in a specific location...
		city or state and you will be pleasantly surprised.
		i think i figured out my conflict with the enigmatic
		and arabic scale...i simply have to call the latter
		the byzantine and then it is not so confusing somehow.
		i played the twenty scales, repeating some of them
		a few times for fun and to memorize since i only
		have learned nineteen of them...given that it is
		still the middle of the night i go back to bed -
		in my dream i then awake in apartment 3k...i am
		alone there and worried since other people have
		access...i am thinking of barricading the door
		but then notice belkis cooking a ton of food -
		she is asking me something about rice but i say
		i don't know what to say while wondering how she
		who has never been to new york is there...i take
		out the trash and see skirt by the elevator but
		when i go to pick him up, it's a mirage...should
		i say hologram...hmm...i open the compactor which
		is nearest to three d - there is a wood slab 
		preventing the opening of the shute - i remove the
		slab and see the bearded man that used to live there
		walking away - i notice there are things scattered 
		around this closet like space that i want and start
		to put them into a bag - a handsome woman appears
		with thin lips talking about the movie and i have
		an exact memory of what she means but not when i 
		saw it or if it was with her - now the cat is really
		in the hallway and i chase him inside...i myself
		go in seeing a huge red wok shaped cooker but covered
		and the pot steaming...it is where the fridge should be
		and i awake again as the three o'clock hour nears...
		i have a certainty that father's spirit is in that apartment, 
		the place i called home longer than any other - otherwise
		i can't decipher this scene...or perhaps it is too early
		for critical thinking.
		 
		4 january 
		very attracted to the gretsch rancher. which made me consider
		acoustic models...however, at this point i'm locked in with
		my martin and the only "popular' models i would consider
		otherwise are the gibsons...i know some people may not
		comprehend the enthusiasm over instruments...like that
		dream - which in reflection i reasoned out via word play,
		ie; kelvis did live a long while in our house and visited
		a few times before that so it might have been about him
		- that is the letters of his name nearly match belkis -
		to clarify without the burden of too much explanation;
		one is a cousin and the other a maid...having not mentioning
		them previously in these notes, i thought it should be stated.
		looking at the image of the radical jabbar, no relation to
		the great kareem abdul, i got goosebumps over the resemblance
		to the man in three d...in an icky way...i feel it's frightful
		and i don't like the way the american year is starting...
		the las vegas truck bomber ?  there's a woman fleshing out
		fearful scenarios in fast words...which is fine, except
		people are listening, some even agreeing...so there's 
		paranoia in the air...i had felt that W and cheney had
		secured the states yet i see now that that might have
		been my immaturity wishing - is there a group intent on
		derailing the return of rightful rule and kennedy...
		ask not what your country can do...at this point i can
		only dot the i over my suspicion. now then, the enthusiasm;
		well it's like this - someone buys a flying v and minutes
		later he starts searching through more pictures of guitars
		and gets into an argument with himself...i will not admit
		openly to him being me, but later i thought about the
		graduation ring...how i wanted a green gem but they all
		said blue...the guitar in question was mint green...a 
		lighter shade than the cadillac green...if it was myself,
		i most likely opted to wait a few months and in terms
		of color, well i was settled on something white or silver.
		i didn't recall any dreams and skipped jotting these
		notes - then last night, i clearly dreamt that a woman
		had positioned herself upon me, she had a woven strip
		of lace lightly lashing out from her mouth as if unraveling,
		reeling downward, naked, she undid my pants and put her
		straddle side on my genitals, when i looked down there
		was a frothing liquid chalk pouring out of her, i was not
		yet erect yet thought i was ejaculating and awoke thinking
		of alexandra and ester who reminds me of alexandra -
		the scene brought to mind the memory of doris scratching
		her eyeball with her nail which i had seen pre-dream
		weeks ago - it always struck me as unusual and i wonder
		why i never asked if her eyeball was itchy...it also
		made me remember the stranger pre-dream of lotta's 
		necklace being drenched in semen...i noticed she 
		stopped wearing it and to some extent made me worry - 
		i think it was some time after frankfurt - i notice
		too a shift in feeling, nearly an absence since xmas.
		it may all of course be my surroundings, even sorrow
		instead of snow...a secret cat fight that i am not
		entirely privvy to - oh the pitfalls of worship...
		long sigh, hmm, so after he gets the flying v he
		thinks to put place a shirley sticker on it...
		we have always lived in the castle...decisions, decisions...
		words i can't ever pronounce right...ennui...
		i read the daemon lover and heard her voice...
		it is near to sylvia plath's tone...
		i re-watched shirley and understood it a bit more...
		i also read her short story paranoia not knowing
		it was unearthed much later...2013...she had
		put it to pen in 1965...feeling  the literary buzz,
		i packed up a few books i wanted to find or finish,
		to keep to the point i will only mention here the
		letters of shirley jackson...i don't expect anything
		as witty as ezra pound or as interesting as william
		burroughs but once i get through hangsaman i expect
		to be pleasantly surprised...uhm hangsaman is the 
		novel she is working on in the film...in terms of 
		my own work, i have only been moved to consider
		a romance story involving carol jean and del lamb -
		going backwards from the end and ending at the
		camelot hotel in tulsa honeymoon after the nixa
		church of christ wedding...mrs lamb passed away
		on the 22nd of december, they were married over
		half a century - of course with all the guitars
		in my thoughts, i don;t expect that a fictional
		version of her story will go further than thought
		for now...i listened to all the available versions
		of deep ellem blues in preparation to record my
		own.
		 
		6 january  
		 
		i get up a quarter past midnight making it nearly
		six in the morning in sweden...i swear it was a
		very strange sunday...i had got up early with
		a dream wherein there was a woman here upon 
		my bed enticing me into making love...there 
		was a cock ring but it was more like a strap
		as the type worn for testitcles i suppose -
		i have the feeling it is rafaelina yet i have
		not heard or thought of her in years...it is
		not exciting as we try two positions and as
		i awake perhaps sensing the oncoming weirdness-
		of course i overthink the matter and it takes
		a couple of hours of contemplation...yet the 
		weather was brilliant, crisp...nearly cold -
		i knew lotta was going back home and viewed
		her glow up video perplexed by her tanning ritual-
		still not as perplexing as ripley which i saw
		almost hating andrew in it yet with a heightened
		sense of emotions as if i somehow identified with
		the character...maybe this was due to the fine
		cinematography...the series is shot in grainy
		greyscale...i watched it for dakota except there
		wasn't enough of her in it...later in the curio
		sunday i watched the watchers which had a lot more
		fanning...anyway the glowy thing took me into the
		noon hour...i felt removed from myself as if one
		walking in a daze...somehow i settled my sexual
		excitement and played through all the scales...
		i did this standing suddenly understanding that
		i don't need to look at the fret in most cases but
		also seeing that at least one of the new ones
		got muddled by not being seated...the cool weather
		made breathing much easier...olives and a sandwich 
		along with the movie...lotta arrived and for a 
		minute there i nearly felt content - well, happy-
		even if i had spent most of the time searching 
		through guitars to buy or not to buy...to bebop
		or to beatnik what is the question...i made a
		wish for a nice time for the actors at the 
		ceremony although i hadn't really thought about
		it since jodi was put up for honors...
		i chose to return to sleep but that was delayed
		by someone yelling outside nearby...i raced to
		reach a point where that sound and its associated
		trauma could not reach me...is it always illegal
		to kill a nuiscance? coffee cigarettes and sprite
		and i went into dreamland especially thanks to lotta -
		well the thought of her which now came with dakota...
		as i thought back to viking days...in my dream i am
		in a hotel intent on saving a girl, she's child like
		and men are bullying her, they even have her naked
		and i manage to manuveur her away...it was then 
		sensual yet in some experimental way as if she were
		a doll or an artificial intelligence embodied...
		we saunter in the escape and reach the railway station 
		- a heavy set man in triplicate surrounds me as i see her
		walk in front and further away - i think of gerard
		but i do not feel small or even skinny as he holds
		my arm, perhaps my shoulders...i only think why are 
		there three of him...i awake but only to snuggle myself
		into further dreams - as i type now i half worry that
		lotta might read these notes and mistake some of the
		thoughts herein for intent...i also wonder if it was
		kelvis that took my assistant commissioner police pin -
		in any case i am glad of taking notice of pre-dreams
		by which i mean those last fading thoughts that don't
		always make sense or even contradict my own ideas...
		i suppose the problem with the day was merely lack
		of restful sleep...hopefully this excursion into
		dream worlds will solve that jigsaw puzzle - in 
		scenes that now fade as if never been, i recall some
		talk of jedi...it's only that i am still getting over
		the irony of such a lovely day without the sounds
		of colmado or avocado fruit vendors still being crashed
		into by some other shouting...well, i was either 
		finally alone in three k or in conversation with lotta
		as my feeling felt a sort of completion...in the struggle
		to recall, there was a moment where something had to be
		paid but i didn't have any cash on me not even my wallet
		when suddenly - i think it was two hundred euros - a
		woman pulls out a stack of what must have been ten or
		twenty thousand euros and peels away a couple of the 
		bills put placing them on the counter to my astonishment.
		maybe it was three hundred since that would match
		with the earlier fat man frenzy...the driver carries no
		cash - i now have this stash of guitar price knowledge...
		i believe i am done searching but i would never have
		guessed how addictive well that is not the right word,
		how entertaining it is for me to look at electric
		guitars...i nearly want to have another look at only
		lovers left alive, but having seen it a couple of times
		already i can play and pause it right in my mind's eye.
		yeah funnel of love could be the soundtrack for scrolling
		through the six string instruments.
		 
		december 8 
		 
		bowie sarah polley elvis day and it seems i was never told
		it was also kreiger and bassey day...a minute ago i was
		thinking of the mistaken lilia instead of my lilia as it
		is also her day...and how the date came to hold meaning
		for me in the first place...nora makes james spill the
		goods...i didn't dream yesterday and today i dreamt so
		clearly of emilee dressing and kissing me that i thought
		i was not dreaming - of course lotta's middle name is 
		emilie and when i awoke i had to confront myself with
		a sort of weighing the matter...i ate most of an orange
		with sugar right away...do i say to me that miss grant
		is calling me or that snowbound lotta's name creates
		this irony...most ironic was pig, as the vice president
		of the nick cage south american fan club, although
		i should be promoted, the film is extremely informative
		if one cares to pay attention...i wasn't in the right
		mind set...the swine's face reminded me of alexandra
		and she is interested in acting but it was the only time
		i felt that except when i used to hang out with a 
		sibling of some narcotic agent...to think of it now he
		died in a car crash and she had a close call driving
		recently...i write it extemporanously and with the hope
		that it voids future incidents when she is at the wheel...
		so portland is three hundred years overdue for the thing
		i will not mention...whoa, nell has not posted in a year,
		i do hope no one has put placed a pony up daddy saddle
		on her...nicole mentioned woman under the influence and
		although i myself dislike boxd-letter, i went to see it.
		the line "i'm not a spaghetti man" sticks with me somehow.
		i couldnt get the right voice and speed to enjoy hangsaman as
		an audio book so i eyeballed it which is much faster yet
		actually slower given my inclination to postpone or procrastinate
		not to mention the natural distractions that occur when it is
		not an actual paperback or hardcover...or it could be that i
		yet feel the white goddess was not entirely learnt...no, not
		as intense as finnegan's wake yet i want to gain as many
		details as i might...still, life keeps moving like a wildfire
		consuming the spaces with red hot burning replacements...
		so as to even make social media scrolling logical to some
		extent...i found it highly interesting that jean-marie passed
		away on the day i failed to secure the agspalding pen i 
		wanted when the topic came up as i forgot my own notion
		of waiting to get it later on...i did get a waterman which
		was on sale...i believe they are french, no less...i believe
		i like mr magoo but i have no clue how he came up in conversation
		with mother...she liked the clip but i was told she did not
		have patience for the film...i thought it was wonderful...
		1001 arabian nights - actually an ancestor; abdul aziz magoo
		sells lamps and his lazy nephew is aladdin...i mean come on
		there are even three little maids from damascus...
		to circle back to the thin white duke, aladdin sane not
		only had the jean genie but also panic in detroit...the
		lions have me expecting them to go all the way after the
		pounding they gave minnesota last sunday...i am trying to
		keep calm...anyway i picked out the format for deep elem
		and plucked through a few ideas but i don't seem to be in 
		a hurry about it. i suppose you could see that as confidence
		or an addiction to hesitation. happy birthday, everyone.
		nobody should feel so crowded with things to do...i run
		through the ideas (shave, clean kitchen, make a meal,
		receive the incoming delivery...groceries, take a bath,
		give up on the idea of fender and esp guitars, well, 
		perhaps not some vintage models, scale ritual, start
		the recording process for that blues song i want to
		cover, update film list, take care of skirt, call mother, and avoid 
		the news while hoping los angeles makes it through
		what can only be called a walking inferno) of course
		instead i avidly search the news and then take a nap...
		pre dream i felt no stability as if a face dance...
		at least they were faces i liked...it's too bad no
		beautiful girl ever feels as pretty as they look - 
		mostly they think it is make up or that their lips
		are too thin or something...suddenly i am excited
		to be asleep...i was fully expecting to see lotta's
		mother as she had been on my mind upon waking but i
		was actually in some european town...like portugal
		i imagine or some hybrid place further north...
		there is a girl that approaches me, somehow she
		knows i am thinking of lotta, oh she's cheating on
		you, i don't say anything and continue sauntering
		until i see her at a dead end street leaning against 
		a silvery grey wall with some guy i do not know and
		i near ironically looking at him not her and i say
	        not what i am thinking meaning he is wearing feathery
		earrings going in fact for a compliment and then walking
		away without speaking to her reaching the corner there
		is an alleyway the type one finds in chinatown places
		where a woman in the type of hat which would be more
		akin to the 1930s or 1940s although less so floats
		into the walkway upon which  point i decide to follow
		the anachronism and also to run yet halfway into my getaway
		lotta is holding on to me and then drags me into some type
		of mall that i can only describe as modern wherein she
		seems intent on proving herself to me...she keeps repeating
		that she wants to be there because they are giving away
		something or other - the last word i saw her use was lustig
		- it had that sound but it was another word - i do not ask
		what she means possibly still annoyed at her being with the
		bloke with the earrings - i notice an extended family and
		a baby - i ask to experience the scene with me which she does
		and it does not feel weird to sort of snuggle inbetween these
		fat women looking down at the child - there are to older children
		next to me and i ask about the kid's name, his name is neptune
		you should say hi to him with his name, i step over to where
		lotta is and see that in the meanwhile they have given her coffee
		and i go along with the hello instructions and the baby waves
		as if he really likes his name and then lotta leads me to 
		a cafe but its one without seats so we go horizantal into
		one of the booths laying down me first then her in front of
		the waitress who immediately settles down a very fine and crisp
		looking salad so i suppose the word meant salad - salat, feldsalat,
		not certain yet i take a close look at the waitress as i write
		this now i want to say julia stiles yet the character was more
		like ginnifer goodwin - in contrast to the guy i actually can't
		memorize her face as i notice her undoing the lace of her collar
		well choker i think they call them above a very sheer uniform
		blouse that was sorely in need of a bra as the sight of nipples
		and petite breasts once again made me realize that indeed for 
		men titties are like the sun then awaking feeling nearer 
		than ever to lotta yet not exactly sure what the dream meant 
		or if the lettuce was any good - i thought later perhaps it 
		meant that she has the notion that those are the type men like
		or something...although i don't think she is insecure and so i 
		won't augment the thought with adding words about her cuteness
		besides what if there is or was an affair...or even the 
		manipulation of emotion to provoke my jealousy after i put 
		placed westsofia77's project on the home page...who knows,
		i do know it is next to impossible to balance the likes and
		loves...usually i dive deep into the situation and neglect
		everything else save for coffee and cigarettes, yet now
		i am reluctant to give in to expectations or jump to conclusions,
		much less make demands or disregard all the whatever it is i 
		need to get done and so it goes.
		 
		january 9 
		 
		correction like the sun...for myself it would be like the rain.
		on second thought the waitress might have been india...
		that would make sense...i felt a sort of magic or synchronicity
		in the list as i placed shanghai express after phantom as it
		was the film playing in the fictional movie house...i had an
		entirely different idea for what would follow yet i could not
		find it and obviously this way even makes more sense - i also
		viewed that film again - noticing the peiping sign and the 
		watch, a flintridge...it has a flip cover which one can still
		get yet it has become an uncommon style...anyway it isn't a
		movie about writers yet there are several written messages
		which qualifies it for the list...after having only soup and
		bread, the big meal made me sluggish...so much so that leaning
		into the twenty scale ritual i was surprised - pleasantly, 
		at my own enthusiasm which i suppose was enhanced by now
		feeling i got them down...i found out leighton was one of
		the victims of the wildfires, well her house, but the 
		knowledge came along with finding out she was married and
		has a couple of children...so in rifling through memory
		the emotions were varied as if they wanted to contradict
		themselves...what i think now or wonder is if she still
		writes music...there was not much music in my mind save
		for a zorn tune...zip, why is it zip code...hmm...gotta
		look that up...questions i never asked...quickly i 
		embraced the idea of lotta in pre-dream as i pondered
		over dean and schecter guitars...you gotta see the
		eastwood guitars tiktok...extremely entertaining if
		you like me like simply looking at guitars...the guy
		from bizarre reno is also cool although he seems a 
		bit too enchanted by old fenders and gibsons...
		seen the maestro series...but everyone says they are
		not worth it...now then dreams...two men stood by
		a truck, one peeing into mid-air as if trying to 
		wet a woman standing across from him...this again
		was a scene in which i felt i was a viewer instead
		of a participant to some extent - as the truck pulls
		away, i see that lilia is in the back, i call to her
		to get out of the truck as it speeds away...i kept
		dreaming easier locations and sensations mostly
		with lotta who got some of the snow cleared...
		anyway none of these moments, perhaps for being so
		casual kept themselves in the waking mind...i did
		think how hard it must be for her to work through
		the fine line of being herself while fencing off
		the once in a while weird multitudes wanting her
		to be something else...i suppose models and actresses
		might relate to being in that positions - as i awoke,
		the scene had me facing a very powerful woman, i 
		thought it might be an actress but that may only have
		been due to the fact that i love cinema so...anyway
		entirely different from my jean harlow silk dream,
		here the woman was adamant - there's nobody like me
		that will make you feel so fine, or was it good...
		and there i was under a spell of sorts even bowing
		down the way one does when knighted by royalty...
		except my penis was gushing pee through the erection
		as if the entire evening was scripted or someone
		was trying to make me wet the bed...yet aside from
		the number one, i felt there was some truth in it
		that was told therein...i don't know who she might
		be however...i know that i mentioned some pre-dream
		similar to all this and perhaps someone reading it

	</br>
		i somehow stumble dream into a department store yet i cannot find
		the right exit, wandering around a woman with thick legs
		grabs me as if a friend then we dance - i can feel her 
		press against me as if teasing the penis resting at her
		thigh - she seems to know that i am trying to get somewhere,
		to get home and we walk out of the place into an avenue
		of darkness, she is walking ahead of me, heading to her car
		and i am asking if she is really going to give me a ride
		when unlocking the door with a guffaw she slides into
		the vehicle leaving me without a clue as to where i am or
		how to get home - i remember asking someone at the shop
		which is the exit that leads to bella vista...a scene
		later said some sort of argument with a man insisting on
		something or other yet somehow wound up with a ruined
		right foot, his valet stopping their ride in its track
		as he howled in pain, getting out and flicking away
		the two remaining toes onto the road carelessly...i
		wake up wondering how i can see this or why i am
		interacting with people that don't like me and i 
		surely don't like...i get up and adjust the los angeles
		lament a bit, thinking i wrote it too hurriedly and it
		could be improved somehow even if i know the main point
		must hit the emotional place no one wants to speak of
		like a bolt of lightning...i hope its quiet today
		as the intrusive talk disrupted my inclination to 
		record...i suppose wearing headphones to get through
		my own kitchen experience would do it otherwise -
		maybe these dreams bordering on nightmare reflect
		how rattled those loudspeakers and locals, as if timed
		to detonate a word or two into the air as i stand
		by the fridge, make me feel. you see i want to think
		of the song not them...in the worst case scenario, 
		a muse or even myself in order to flesh out something
		beyond this time and this place. ps, pre dream very
		clear thought of ive fang this from memory handing
		each other notes while i learned some chinese...
		let us call it nostalgia - no sense in next dream
		strolling what can only be washington heights -
		a man is trying to tell me about some politician
		that admires the police - i don't stop but glance
		at the nightmare image of three men dressed up
		like halloween cops - i can't help but voice the
		fact of their corruption...dominicans! finding
		a train station i am as if in a sequel to previous
		dream trying to get home except now to manhattan -
		i get on a train slowly with some guy that keeps
		talking - get in, get in, he says - it is not like
		the mta, in fact like a rollercoaster with an iron
		belt strap holding the passengers in place - 
		there are two other guys in the front seat and
		and a blurry figure directly behind so three rows
		and this contraption is going to brooklyn and i am
		asking what the stop is, brubaker? can i then transfer
		back to a wagon to the city...the answer is vague,
		the guys are in argument. i have no idea who they 
		are and awake baffled especially since like the 
		buses in rome one simply gets on without the process
		of payment, if i recall it was sort of an honor system
		in italy...but to someone from new york that means
		a free ride...weird to think of that now. 
		 
		11 january 
		 
		well in reality not so weird, if i was thinking of
		home, it would make sense as i felt at home in rome.
		my dreams exploded into psychodelic vision the type
		one might experience only with drugs or during a
		fight except being hit in the eye is not as colorful
		where the expression seeing stars originates...
		after that all the scenes were easier yet nothing
		i suppose remarkable enough to linger into waking -
		i guess i was too excited over finally recording
		deep elem blues...i did an electric version which
		i still liked after listening to it a few times -
		even if i feel the chorus vocal needs to be doubled
		and the fact that it went over five minutes...i 
		did that on an empty stomach and then after a light
		meal i recorded a different version of the same 
		song using the acoustic but this take was haunted
		by someone mentioning a now political singer-songwriter,
		strange how that happens - so i struggled even with 
		the words as if distracted although i've been studying
		them and even wrote them down...anyway no excuses, that
		second take was still good but far from great except
		for the way i turned the chord changes...making it a
		seventh e then a bent e on the fourth fret resolving 
		into the regular e major on the verses...the vocal was
		awful in failing to be mindful of the words and again
		over five minutes...i decided to give the shelton brothers
		version another listen since i based it on them...ah,
		no break between the verse and chorus gets you a three
		minute song...still, for only having done the scale ritual
		in recent weeks or even months, i felt pretty pleased at
		the results...i could nearly understand why the beatles
		recorded dozens of takes...not that i am going in that
		direction...yet all this is tempered by the knowledge
		of the massive destruction in california...the press
		reports the death of sam from sam & dave...i listen
		to hold on i'm coming, a tune impossible to dislike -
		but then the thing that makes most sense to hear at
		a time like this is the alabama five woke up this
		morning soprano theme song...i hear a few more songs
		that are "suggested" on yt...put placing this pen 
		into actions evident here...it is yet very early in
		the day and hopefully i will get at least a third
		take of the cover i'm working on...

		      14 january 
		       

	when i got around to mixing the deep elem tracks i realized
	why it sometimes takes me a while to play around with the daw -
	or even why at other times i rush through the process of song
	production...it's like an added step which requires an entirely
	different talent and disposition...neither of which are easy 
	for me - like editing a book after the writing is done...
	since there are several live takes, which leaves nothing much in
	terms of mastering - given that it is all on one track, this
	conundrum was eased - although i did not expect to do it all
	in two days...much less to get a couple of tracks i really 
	like...the only thing i didn't do was record videos for these,
	instead opting to put place scenes from the white hell of 
	pitz palu on each song...always thought leni was a director
	but you can see her acting in that...	   
	i simply felt a bit too disheveled and further could not 
	decide on a location...although i do have a room that 
	could be nice for filming...anyway presenting it this
	way feels cooler, even quirky...my only real trouble 
	came using the open e tuning for one take which took me
	about twelve attempts to find a groove that would mesh
	with the vocal i had in mind...i did not have it in mind
	to put place them here, however, when i went to upload
	from laptop to phone, the cord did not respond except 
	to see itself as charging which led me to upload them
	thisaway for access at video editing - well, enough 
	notes on deep elem - i am a bit further into hangsaman
	and have watched this is the night -bj, "before javeline"
	and learned a bit about thelma todd - i also viewed the
	wisdom of crocodiles - sometimes called immortality and
	was pretty impressed, especially by timothy's performance -
	even if the antagonist thugs were overplayed...
	otherwise not much to report in terms of dreams - 
	i'm certain of dreaming of lotta last night yet in
	such a casual way that there is only a glimpse memory
	remaining - yesterday dreaming of walking into a 
	magazine shop on the upper west side - for some reason
	handing the man there my backpack - i was thinking i 
	had four dollars yet i am not sure what i wanted to buy -
	i awoke wondering if it was about the brim screenplay
	or the two dollar bill i had used there once upon a time -
	afternoon ordering water, i was actually sent extra money and
	phoned back to return it - a few minutes later i decided
	to review my other phone and found a letter from mike -
	it had been a while and brought up some recollections i
	had not entertained or considered previously - specifically
	about another timothy...oh my rock star friends...it was
	mr wright that gave me a lesson about rasputin by way of
	maria's book. meanwhile a lot of talk about tiktok, there
	is one protest clip displaying the united states blowing
	itself up...so china can't have it...i feel awful for the
	american creators living under a system that does not respect
	their freedom in that sense...how nice is it to earn a decent
	wage doing something you actually enjoy, i saw one girl was
	even able to purchase a house...to speak of this naturally
	leads to politics, i know the kremlin took similar actions
	even if i feel this now proves my point about there being
	more freedom in moscow than washington - especially in the
	sense that what they want is to own that platform...now
	the viral jealousy sound seems eerily prophetic, if i can't
	have you; no one can...so the stolen election that started
	with wuhan kiev ends with bytedancing wildfires. ps, 
	yes justine it was disaster tourism when they alerted the
	press for photo-ops, drove an hour and a half to spend
	a whopping fifteen minutes showing their hats...i felt
	physically upset until paris stood up for displaced cats
	and even adopted a dog, like burroughs said you can't fake
	quality like you can't fake a good meal. 

		       
		      15 january 
		       
	i feel like the spirit of wsb summoned queer and i am
	terribly excited to see how the film fleshed out the 
	novel...i re-read that opening chapter a few weeks ago
	when i made one of the writing processors you can find
	here in this domain, there are others at inkrealm.info
	- because when i first read it what stayed was me was
	the note he made a prefix in which he detailed his
	feelings about joan vollmer...possession, to many is
	not a viable truth yet like in the shirley jackson story,
	where i easily related it as factual, i see now that
	i missed that point or rather did not connect my 
	experiences with that word - indeed, possession is 
	not only a viable truth, i tell you i have seen it
        happen. i do not mean in the catholic exorcism way,
	although others have seen that...yet none of this is
	what i actually wanted to jot but i suppose my thrill
	at getting to see this movie overtakes me...i wanted
	to take another dig at the publicity seeking former
	royals who somehow keep using and are still named
	as if HRH when they are not. hell the queen may her
	soul rest in peace even revoked their cottage she
	was so upset...perhaps south east england is now
	montecito...the duke and duchess of montecito, i mean
	if the press is going to keep playing along why not go
	all the way - this rant is tempered by the fact that
	i noticed the media kicking the not so dynamic duo
	of biden harris and i don't want to come off as a bully -
	or appear to partake in persecution even if justified. 
	so i won't "say" more at this juncture - now then, this
	brings to mind how crushed paris was while thinking 
	she could never be a princess...yet now, clearly,
	if anyone can claim the title of american royalty -
	it is her...in a quiet and effective manner she managed
	to raise eight hundred thousand dollars and counting
	in mere minutes...of course, this might be due to the
	fact of her malibu home on top of her rv trailer incident,
	but i can;t see any selfishness in her fundraising and
	much less in her caring for pets all the while being a
	loving mother although ms hilton i do think you are going
	to spoil them kids...ahem. yes i am done kissing ass,
	i viewed spread, more for the list and keitel than anything-
	it had this very strange butt licking thing, a mediocre
	movie with a few good lines...i know iknow comedy is hard...
	somehow the last two days the scales became hard...well two
	of twenty...a couple of them somehow got jumbled in my head
	where surely the melodic was being called the minor in the
	bebop notes and as i noticed it it took some of the edge off
	my confidence, luckily i am pretty sure i won't have to speak
	about scales to anyone...i saw that ozzy is now in the hall of
	fame and did a bit of celebration via reposting but with
	the concern that  rhoads got the guitar award '81 only
	months before his passing '82 and this thing was '24 and
	hopefully he will not be in danger in '25 if you see my 
	logic although i suppose we are all in danger and him 
	moreso regardless of awards...like the pope, it's a focus
	point that people fixate on or as dylan put placed it,
	people can kill you with kindness...fame leaves few
	hiding places, hmm bowie put it concisely; what you need
	you have to borrow...i can't borrow the guitars i want
	but last night that was what i was dreaming of, electric
	instruments...still only a glimpse-memory as i awoke 
	tormented by a nagging pain for the second day in a row -
	the time before it felt like my calf was being twisted -
	lower back as if all those tumblr ads had gone to work
	on a subconscious level, too bizarre well like possession...
	to come full circle in the note - it's as if someone is
	trying to go to sleep within me thus awaking me painfully -
	who knows - uhm i felt fine as i pondered the matter and
	fed the cat, so fine i went back to sleep and dreamt i 
	owned some sort of cafe bar with suze, the place had two
	rooms, it was not crowded and i asked her to take my
	things...wallet, watch, hmm, there were two wallets...
	well she took these things into the other room, a sort
	of private office slash vip area...i was taking care of
	the front when this rude woman tried to rush past me
	to gain access to where she was...i lifted a small white
	statue to her face and ended the invasion then i went
	in for some reason asking her for my wallet, she handed
	me the zara but i said i wanted the valentino and then
	we seemed to trade places as i stayed in that room and
	she made her way to the front - the doors were swinging
	types and before she could exit she was confronted by
	several men, surrounded, attacked - i ran and tried to
	pry the one behind her off her by the mouth but then 
	thought the eyes and started clawing into one of his 
	eyes with my right hand while pulling him away with my
	left hand...all pretty intense and i awoke hoping no
	woman i knew would be wounded in this way and that
	i would not know the feeling of pushing a man's eye
	away from the socket...for a minute it all felt like
	an alternate reality...as if married and running a
	mom and pop shop...she loved that guthrie kid tale
	about how people get hitched, i can't recall it but
	it was something about the man simply putting a 
	a ring on the woman's finger...i never called nobody
	as much as i phoned her over the hills and far away...
	william shot joan, a peeper sized hole in the forehead, 
	i believe his story but it troubles me that her child who was there
	is hardly ever mentioned - either to protect her,
	or more likely to not complicate matters further
	in the face of tragedy...this is one aspect i 
	am intent on seeing addressed in the film.

	 
		       
		      16 january 
		       

		i have always loved the word juxtaposition...it felt
		foreign and i could never imagine it in the mouth of
		some old-timer...much less a foreigner. 
		thursday. so it was wednesday when i watched queer.
		i was enjoying the opening, not so much the font, 
		until i heard sinead oconner singing all apologies -
		that is a nirvana tune, naturally i started thinking
		of william meeting kurt and how sad it was for music
		that her voice although immortal will not make new
		songs...these thoughts along with a slight concern
	        over a grocery delivery which i expected to arrive
		between eight and eleven - it came about ten thirty -
		or as the film left the caverns of ecuador - went 
	        through me along with a suspicion that the soundtrack
		would be too distracting...don't get me wrong, the
		songs were mostly good except the sort of hyped up
		ending 'how can..' thing which has burroughs' name 
		stapled on it without his exact consent - contrary
		to what may seem a negative review allow me to preface
		these scribbles by saying i have rarely wanted to enjoy
		a film as much as i did this one - given that i admire
		wsb's writing greatly...and this is a great film with
		unexpected and wonderful acting by the lead, mr craig.
		yet before we are allowed to vibe at his electricity,
		there is 'come as you are' like a music video complete
		with rooster fighting sounds as the protagonist catches
		sight of what turns out to be both a supporting player 
		and the antagonist unless you consider drug use in that
		category instead - but i didn't want to judge this like
		that in fact the fact that it made me think of things
		external to daniel or william should have told me what
		i am about to divulge; well implore, please remake this
		with a proper soundtrack! not only does it step on the
		actor's toes but it tramples over el hombre invisible -
		watch it and see how the next song - some low rumble 
		jazz leaves you wondering about the meaning of "segue" in 
		the next scene which they used for the trailer...transition
		might be more apt - re; segue...
		before all this - i should have mentioned the starting
		credits serve as a catalyst to the confusion i have 
		underlined...lowery's under the volcano next to rimbaud's
		a season in hell...might even make some viewers pause
		to read both books before proceeding...camel cigarettes
		are all over the place - in those opening credits they
		lay next to raleigh cigarettes...although he gave up
		smoking, in the 1990s he was fond of kamel menthols
		which i guess is where they came up with camels...
		burroughs smoked old gold, lucky strikes, benson&hedges,
		      english ovals, and senior service...of course 
		marijuana but that is not to the point...
	        more to the point are the guns, a clip line of ten
		handguns curls into seven; mauser, derringer, star model b or beretta, 
		      a colt, amadeo rossi, norinco, harrington or foehl & weeks,
		the fire arm of the famed incident was the star .380 automatic
		but the tragedy itself is not only overlooked but disguised
		as if he had shot the supporting player/antagonist well at least
		in a lynchian lifted type dream sequence time lapse which winds up
		making us look at the man in the aforementioned 90s without
		the novelty camel smokes - a bit before - to not lose the
		lack of logic in the soundtrack - a french or italian pop
		song sprinkles itself mysteriously as daniel/william falls
		to earth from the sky and saunters back to chips ahoy...
		the absence of mexico in all this is a spectacular form
		of writing, we never feel mexico city and much less quito -
		quitting for a minute to grab the goods from the door and
		put things here and there i thought well my soup was pretty
		good and daniel is shockingly good even if too fat to play
		bill - well, not fat - stocky - yes too strong physically
		even during withdrawal we already sense he will pull through-
		i watched the ending positively hating the final song but
		said to myself take a another look and listen tomorrow,
		sleep on it...and so i did, it only got worse. i awoke 
		and went through guitar scales...a string popped and 
		i found there two very troubled screws living in the 
		ibanez roadstar ii - rusty and refusing any sort of twist
		or turn...i had to put place most of the strings back 
		again carefully and i nearly cried after - i suppose
		the sense of tears was also weeping over this great
		and interesting film which in fact even hinted at the
		irony of joan's child by way of a kid at the bottom
		of the stairs and yes i did catch the william tell
		sofa playing in the party overdose trip...crying
		because the soundtrack sucked harder than the
		homosexual scenes - wilder than i expected but also
		lessened by this intrusive soundtrack, like i said,
		a lot of good songs but in the wrong place, dr john
		might have shaped some if best with 'right place wrong
		time' - i am well aware of the amount of work and love
		that goes into something like this and of how careless
		this note might come off as, but why should i lie about
		how i feel except to myself and in fantasy where i
		could convince myself that jean harlow is embracing me - 
		indeed, i expect anyone actually reading this demands
		my truth in a sense and so it goes...off the top of my
		head i think an entire bowie soundtrack would have
		worked if the point was to please the mtv and social
		media scroll crowds along with having it be someone he
		had some interaction with...when time magazine tells
		you why it is a grand statement with explanations then
		you know something is wrong and for me it was the tunes. 
		how i wish this was not the case. now then to further
		juxtapose; hollywoodland by two skinny girls should
		be released any minute now, well re-released...
		      which i will now dedicate to someone with
		      several perfect soundtracks, david lynch,
		      not to mention a goodly record of his own.
		      they are saying he is dead but they are
		      wrong, lynch is not dead because lynch is
		      immortal!
		       
		       
		hollywoodland

		      it made sense, to me, to watch hoodlum empire
		on the heels of kraven the hunter and i sort of got
		a kick out of both...still, friday was an awful
		day which did not improve until i put it to bed -
		lotta had said she hated sitting around the apartment
		all the time and that is coherent yet it is also
		the opposite of how i feel...very much enjoying
		the confines of my place which even make me wonder
		how anyone can manage to live in much larger spaces
		as i often find myself wishing there were less rooms
		that being in terms of cleaning - in terms of dreams
		i had one vague scene in aunt's house...i remember
		it sort of turned or transformed into a shop but 
		the details escape - kind of like being in the
		inconsistent thoughts of the girl from hangsaman...
		a bit of inconsistancy with the guitar scales -
		i suppose it is due to being stubborn - as once
		i believe it learnt i don't check to see if i am
		right...how can an egomaniac be wrong...well as
		it happened with one suspended scale which i didn't
		catch until weeks later, i made it a point to get
		these errors corrected and i am pretty confident that
		i won't mix up the enigmatic with the byzantine
		unless i start calling it arabic again...the new
		ones, voodoo and bali, also get a bit mixed up in
		my mind but repetition of their patterns is now
		catching up to automatic memory...in fact, i felt
		so good about it, i started learning another bebop
		scale in order to know the complete versions...
		in dreams, i saw guitars, one was very nice yet
		i could not find it as i walked between rooms 
		encountering a dusty left handed strat which i
		am actually curious to attempt if only to see
		how it feels to have the knobs nearer to the wrist -
		in the dream there was a bizarre typewriter with
		cash register keys in the middle which was atop
		a blue metal case ibm hard drive seemingly - i;ve
		not seen anything like it as it is not like any
		existing model although a bit like the ancient 
		manual typewriters in terms of size - i should
		report that i was able to - with kitchen knife
		      and tweezers - to untangle the remaining
		stuck screw from the ibanez which gives me a 
		bit more freedom in terms of the pluck or strum
		which i have on purpose kept from being too intense
		so as not have to purchase new strings - exhausted
		from this process i left the old strings on there -
		it does not sound great, the mismatched ernie balls
		but it's good enough to run through the twenty scale
		ritual - now in mentioning these things i do not mean
		to imply mastery of my instrument in fact more correctly
		lack of expertise...even if i do not feel that way when
		playing something familiar or improvising upon it. my
                favorite new song is an archaic thing called 'i've
		got a feeling i'm falling' - annette hanshaw...1929,
		or thereabouts...it thrills me.
		       
		       
		      19 january 
		       
		      "did you ever have a dream that you couldn;t
		explain...ever met your accusers face to face in the rain..."
		i used to think of that song alot - not to learn chords
		or words, but it stuck around my mind after i learnt
		the words...i bring it up as a point of irony - as i
		never tried to play it or even play along to it...
		maybe it was the references to milton and dante at
		the start...i don't recall the start of this dream,
		i found myself in a shop as if part of a group that
		was looting the place...i remember scattered pens
		adorning the floor near the counter by the exit -
		i might hve been thinking how strange it was that
		shirley jackson used the ellipses alot in hangsaman...
		it sort of made me feel justified in terms of myself
		employing them...but enough to join marauders and trash
		a place in a dream? hmm...perhaps...outside it was still
		light but the grey light that is nowhere near bright -
		i had a delay getting a german film entitled 'hotel', which
		i am viewing now, and watched 'the trust' which exceeds
		irony on several levels...we are getting into a car -
		a silver only slightly brighter than the asphalt, a station
		wagon but one of the guys begins to argue with me - not
		certain what it was about - he pulls out a knife and starts
		to do that sort of dance knife wielders do who have no 
		training in martial arts - i do not think of defending
		myself except to say something about the logic of simply
		getting away and leaving the violent discussion for later -
		in memory i turn away and into the vehicle as he charges
		then shift away from his reckless plunge leading him into
		the car and then getting in myself but that might be a 
		fictional version of the dream as i am pretty certain i
		awoke before turning...awaking, i look at the time, i 
		make coffee, i let a few cigarettes smoke, i think of
	        lotta and update domains, then weaving through headlines
		i find "man stabbed to death, teen wounded on lower east
		side outside movie theater' -there are, it seems, ten
		films playing in that house; the goonies, one of them
		days, wolf man, den of thieves, the last show girl,
		a complete unknown, babygirl, nosferatu, mufasa, the
		brutalist, nickel boys, september 5, anora, and 
		wicked...a couple of tickets cost about thirty dollars.
		(there is no charge to get punctured by knife
		or to hold it in a deadly grip even if amazon
		will not deliver blades to the new york area)
		i'd only watch the kidman film and the anderson movie. 
		i'd been thinking that the literal translation of the
		others in german is die anderen although they say
		it was called unknown, unbekannt...sorry tiktok isnt
		available right now...close app! one nation under a 
		groove, but since most folks don't go to church on
		sunday no more i hear service is being restored...
		i returned to sleep actually dreaming of myself in
		a surprised mirror as if searching for my face by
		lifting and pulling my hair back...sometimes one
		even forgets that beauty comes from within...lotta
		made pasta. i played the scale ritual and plan to 
		give it another go before going back to the deep
		woods of the austrian alps in 'hotel'...ps, Detroit's
	        nearly perfect season came to an end when a wide
		receiver threw a pass to a running back under double
		coverage as they trailed by ten in the fourth quarter.
		there is nothing to say except thanks anyway and
		hope somehow those fans that paid two thousand for
		a seat ticket get a refund. man woman or teen i
		really thought they could take it this year. well,
		now one is left to cheer only for a chief's defeat.
		  
		       
		      20 jan 
		       
		      to conclude the string point; if memory serves
		the nearest place to get them here ran about double
		the cost, that was about seven hundred pesos...but i
		am speaking of years ago...as i
		search now i see regular slinky's advertised for over
		fifteen hundred pesos - uhm well over twenty dollars...
		so you understand it's not the five dollars we are 
		used to paying...there might be less expensive options
		but even so in taking a cab it would not add up to be
		careless in that sense...
		and yes i could get b and high e string by themselves
		but usually not the same brand and i imagine the sound
		quality would suffer...lastly, i have purchased no
		acoustic strings in a while going for the electric
		variety on the martin...i really liked the ring of
		fender bullets but i only found those onetime...my
		choice is dean markley bronze which i have never seen
		here...in case anyone wondered -
		after a long and convoluted conversation with mother
		and sister i got curious over a certain porn but when i skipped
		through it i thought it more horrific than anything
		and not only did it derail my goal of research but
		also it felt like i was witnessing a murder - even
		if it has become commonplace with onlyfans and such -
		i can't see that girl being taken seriously, it was
		as if she was turned into a triviality, a ghost
		that would itself be haunted. later i thought too, 
		the man involved -who showed his face- has limited
	        himself in unimaginable ways...obviously politics
		would be out of the question et cetera, a type of
		social suicide and for what? there is not that much
		money in that business...well, there is some but
		that type of content has become so readily available
		that mostly it is done in part to maintain the patriarchy
		and in part to have incel parties or something like that...
		anyway this demostrates the appointment in samarra story
		irony as in trying to escape my careless talk i only
		found a greater annoyance...somehow i did duck out
		from both bizarre ponds and got to sleep although much
		later than i wanted or expected...therein i thought not
		of strings or conversations or horrid vulgarity...in fact
		i was in my room a lot more colorful than i recall -
		i seemed to be joking with myself about going to a 
		school as a teacher or as a student and so picking out
		the outfit when suddenly i wanted to cut class, yes no
		backpack to take lessons and no tweed blazer to give
		a lecture yet i feeling so confident over this unusual
		ability of being either or...the phone rang, faculty
		insisting that i not be late for my class, hmm so it
		was a lecture day and so i would not be free unless,
                i thought, i gave up both roles and kept this recurring
		dream as a personal treasure for memory as it was now
		for some reason revealing itself to me so much so the
		self-jape felt entertaining - some people did not
		find 'hotel' entertaining but right at the end i knew
		it as if i had written it - i understood the mystery
		as if by instinct, as if there could be no other way 
		to write that ending. i've only felt that way once 
		before while viewing an atom egoyan movie and that
		was nearly dejavu in some sense except i had not seen
		it before...to think there will only be a very limited
		amount of new david lynch projects is truly sad, sadder
		than cheap ass porn. william s burroughs wrote something
		about this pen occupation like simply doing his homework.
		i think it was in a book entitled the job. perhaps, that
		was the catalyst of those learning dream scenes...ps,
		i wanted to underline something about guitar scales,
		i mostly do them as a way of honoring jerry garcia...
		by mentioning them i do not mean to recommend the
		ritual since everyone has their own method...chords,
		knowing chords should be sufficient knowledge to 
		work out notes for leads and i found this to be very true and
		to some extent easier...i know a lot of guitarists
		simplify the scales by only using a box shape and
		i mention this hoping to clarify my position...sometimes
		i will admit that the extra knowledge helps yet all
		one has to do is review how many players breathed
		genius without knowing how to read music and often
		enough without any idea of scales or as i often 
		put placed it; there are only essentially seven notes.
		      	       
		       
		      21 jan 
		       
		i didn't imagine it like soft porn, yet that is
		what the rom com 'lick' was...yet nearly good...
		but to add a note upon yesterday's thought, in
		trying to avoid the hoopla over inauguration,
		hoping they get down to business, i came across
		a clip of bo diddly playing bo diddly...
		now neither you nor i could count the songs
		that draw from that rhythm...i bring it up since it
		demonstrates perfectly the idea of only needing chords-
		so let us say it is in the key of E or C sharp minor,
		some say it is in G and maybe buddy holly played
		it in A with a jazzier turn...makes no difference 
		as the one prevailing chord rings through it and 
		the solo is merely sliding that self same chord up 
		      an octave...somehow it all works in fact 
		      wonderfully which is why so many other
		songs take up that groove...
		      so if anyone tries to convince you that
		you need this or that well basically you don't as
		the one chord song proves itself and it is not
		alone in that category...
		i got halfway through hangsaman and went to sleep
		early wherein i dreamt of riding on a train as if
		going from one compartment to another, there was
		a kitten in a waste basket as i passed through
		then two cats that looked worried so i picked them
		up to get them on their way noticing some much
		larger animal threatening them, i want to say it
		was an elephant yet it could have been a rhino -
		something grey at which point i awoke concerned
		since lotta would be traveling...i wondered if
		she was taking a train to her destination and
		nervously smoked through a couple of cups of coffee
		until seeing she was flying...i suppose amsterdam
		or copenhagen...since those flights match the 
		timeline although there were a couple to other
		parts of sweden but i doubt anything is going
		down in those places...before the settling knowledge
		i managed to nap but in such an odd manner that
		no logic manifested...i mean i was listening to
		someone i used to know speak, he kept talking
		as if in a race - when he started telling me
		about his son being better at drawing than at
		learning languages well i had to stop him, responding
		that it was not wise to speak so much...irl,
		he had a daughter...but rising i thought it might
		be about my first neighbors here, who were actually
		much nicer than those that remained, it was the
		same first name...yet in a split second i decided
		that it could be about the 'soho' residences across
		the street...one of which is guarded by a company
		strangely called cvs...cv being the person's initials,
		adding an s well if you have been in the states you
		most likely have come across that pharmacy chain...
		the last time i was there, buying camel blue hundreds,
		i picked up an electrical adaptor that still funtions.
		no matter, i followed through on my scale ritual and
		looked at 'advanced' chord shapes beyond the common
		ones i had not thought of much...there are about forty 
		and while i don't see myself employing a major seventh
		sharp 5 and sharp nine it might happen or help in other
		ways...the rest i know...i'm thinking in terms of jazz
		but it occurs to me that none of the jazz players i 
		heard speak ever talked chords at all...indeed, drugs
		mostly and onetime food...django reinhardt likely
		had more food than drugs but it gives me pause
		when i a see let us say the g major with an added 6th
		and ninth in his chord changes knowing the man had
		only had his thumb to balance two working fingers...
		       
		       
		      22 january
		       
		      the other day, i awoke feeling that my skin was
		dry yet when i went to bathe it felt fine...i suspected
		that incident started what i hope is no series of dreams...
		well, it is not exactly in the category of dreams, more
		like a stop watch alerting loudly...'wake the fuck up'
		i heard stumbling out of scenes and even felt a hand
		pulling at my right shoulder - a few days ago which i
		never noted since it was neither thought nor dream or
		so it seemed...yesterday as i thought about lotta, 
		who actually went to berlin not the places i imagined,
		i dreamt i was making a telephone call in my room -
		yet i could sense and see a man listening in on
		the other side as in a wiretap...opening the door
		a scantily dressed or perhaps even naked man pranced
		about the hallway - for a second i considered the
		ghost of father yet more likely an impersonator...
		then a woman's voice saying loudly, 'where is my beau'
		of course i could net tell if she meant bow, or bo,
		or me...turkey ski resort disaster? needless to say
		i felt a bit lost, then much later i again dreamt 
		train station...nothing as nice as the kremlin lines
		or as dingy as the manhattan queens bronx stops,
		no something in between - possibly in europe...
		large white structures which i somehow stepped
		out of then unaware of my location or which way
		to go...in wandering and asking, how do i get back
		to the train station that goes everywhere, a woman
		volunteered to drive me...she seemed to be a mail
		carrier yet her car was a jigsaw puzzle of a station
		wagon - open at the back so the seats had to be turned
		so as to pretend the door was shut - i think she looked
		like shirley jackson...i'm two hundred pages into hangsaman -
		i can sort of tell when and where she leaves hints of
		herself...some weird synchronicty was going down as
		i read her writing about milton and i had very recently
		mentioned here the reference to the rose of sharon from
		paradise lost...moreover the sudden trailer for amanda's
		seven veils...two other men get in the post woman's rinky
		dink car and i awake before she gets in the driver;s seat -
		i was also in the middle of viewing the french film
		'a second act' it is terribly exciting in that there are
		two scripts streaming in the form of a romance as well as
		the actors really reacting to eachother as if in ad libs
		or so it seems when the lines are really good - i left
		it to give it more attention later...
		      (not long after i learned the story about
		      steely dan's second arrangement...along
		      with how one of them was dumped and then
		      hit by a car...this was gaucho...they say
		      one of the recording engineers erased the
		      masters and the new take didn't feel right
		      so it was left off the album, somehow there
		      are surfaced renditions of the tune now...
		      i gave it a listen, not exactly sure if
		      i liked it...then i borrowed the notion that
		      they didn't like it either since they never
		      played it live and so the eraser tale might
		      simply be a myth to add to the legend of 
		      their last record which indeed has other
		      great songs...it is only fair to state that
		      other ears consider the "lost" song as genius...)
		      i gave an extra
		turn to the newer scales and went to sleep...which i am
		about to attempt again - sleep, that is, given that i
	        only slept for a couple of hours as if i needed to 
		see it was the sly hotel and wish for lotta's success more
		sincerely as i felt some sort of intensity and then
		possibly became too casual or even distracted in what
		i termed worship. 
			      post-script, lots of thought in dream
		      instead of dreaming...is the rock and roll hall
		      of fame for rap, does that mean spoken word will
		      be included...i agree with jerry that it is another
		      category but i also think the nature of rebellion
		      does exist in some rap - i mean sabotage by the
		      beastie boys could be either rock or rap...the
		      contradiction comes becomes irony as a lot of spoken word
		      artists do not play any instruments unless one
		      is more careful in judgement and views the vocal
		      as a type of musical instrument in the way actors
		      view their body...but then does that mean that
		      ai composed songs will be eligible for such honors...
		      my feeling is that it is all right to not limit
		      what rock was or will be yet for my money if there
		      is no guitar it ain't rocking and i think that is
		      what garcia meant...
		      aside from pondering in the lake of rapid eye
		      movement...before rising from bed, i felt as if a
		      hairdresser studying the back of someone's head -
		      i think it was someone i didn't like and still don't,
		      which reminds me that i also thought and dreamt of
		      an ex-girlfriend...no i do not know how to balance
		      friendships and love...does marriage mean no real
		      friends, it can't be or maybe why so many divorces...
		      i can't seem to clearly define devotion without
		      some sort of disregard for new faces yet that
		      feels extreme as it produces a weird guilt since
		      no one is above or better than anyone else yet
		      equally to accept someone alongside love leads
		      to impossible confusion. no fair solution. i hope
		      i am being as kind as possible to all that care about
		      me, especially the women. to give a specific example
		      i should have already taken the time to listen to 
		      julia yet in my concern for self and worship i left
		      it for later...as you can see, i am wrong even if
		     i am right because in setting boundaries to my bliss
		      i have missed that moment...and i wonder if by 
		      respecting someone am i disrespecting another...
		      but i mean no disrespect, or as hunter put placed
		      it, 'pay the ticket; take the ride.' yes, we
		      are professionals, after all or will our children
		      face the induction of sped-up renditions of songs..
		      ps, speaking of songs hollywood land was re-released
		      now as i fininshed reading the novel...the writing
		      in the ending parts is nothing short of wonderful
		      however since i picked it up after seeing the film
		      i was expecting natalie to go missing...yet i can 
		      see her point in terms of poetry...that is the girl
		      we are reading about by the end is not the same girl
		      from the start...there is an evolution, an arch, a 
		      journey which i suppose she meant to empower future
		      girls...you don't have to fit in, you can overcome
		      the feelings and even the failures filling up the
		      pathway...moreover it blended nearly to a match with
		      the ending of 'hotel'...without the scream, of course. 
		       
		       
		      23 january 
		       
		      'a second act' turned out too good to explain, exceeding
		      itself somehow and whatever it is one might be expecting.
		      even the tracking shot ending shooting its own trail...
		      well, there really there are no words to describe it
		      without giving away extensive spoilers so i will simply
		      recommend it to dear readers that enjoy goodly cinema. 
		      excellent. i went to sleep a bit later searching around
		      nearly aimlessly except to see if the flight from berlin
		      had gotten into stockholm...in my dream i am running
		      with only shoes and shorts - it is the upper west side
		      - broadway and i notice a woman making herself at home
		      on the sidewalk by one of the columbia buildings - there
		      is a dollar bill in triangular shape which i step on
		      while jogging and for a second think to grab it yet
		      at the same time think of paris france and how some
		      flimflam folk put place money in front of themselves
		      to trip up the unsuspecting person passing by so i
		      keep going on my way - now with a panic that i have
		      left without taking my keys yet i feel them in a 
		      pocket on the right side - a moment later i notice
		      a crowd and turn away to run down amsterdam avenue
		      and head back home...three men of the crowd seem
		      to be chasing me and my left shoe needs to be adjusted
		      as i was wearing it like a slipper and now needed to
		      go faster - i adjust the sneaker and start to race yet
		      pretty soon they are upon me - well one of them is -
		      i neither recognixe the face nor like it and i start
		      saying 'only titty only' not knowing exactly why
		      or possibly 'only teeter only' 
		      as he reaches for me i twist his wrist into a break
		      suddenly returning to the speed of my stride yet
		      scared then awaking confused...not over the borderline
		      nightmare as it is maybe par for course in terms of
		      city dwelling but the utterly bizarre phrase spoken
		      as if a foreign girl trying to save herself without
		      knowing the english words for what she was trying to 
		      convey in order to escape...earlier in the day, after
		      taking a shower, i felt an intense pain invading my
		      right thigh and upon waking i wondered if there was 
		      a connection...hmm, the keys were the ones before 
		      they switched to an expensive multi-lock key or so
		      it seemed from the feel of them...weird, i still
		      have those keys for no specific reason. 
		       
		       
		      24 january
		       
		      i failed to consider the dream in terms of time travel...
		      ttty is word coined in 1820...yet before and after that
		      date there were; tittymal, tittymal, tittytotty, tittybar,
		      tittybag, and tittybottle or one could go futher back into
		      into the 1700s with tittup, tittuping, and later tittupy...
		      as for teeter, it's from the Middle English titeren 
		     to totter, reel; akin to Old High German zittarōn to shiver...
		      i thought it could be a chinese mispronounciation due to
		      the R if it was teeter yet the idea doesn't work since it
		      is at the end of the word...in any case, i felt awful
		      sad through the morning yesterday and pretty unwilling
		      to do much in the afternoon...the only bright period
		      was viewing the hangman, no relation to hangsaman, as
		      i did not recall watching tina in a motion picture...
		      as much as i am opposed to the boob tube, i sure 
		      cannot deny being raised and entertained by it...
		      it was also nice to see demi get a nom even if the
		      academy did not respect the balance by leaving margaret
		      out as it were...anyway i still wanted to nothing
		      and carried on in that manner until deciding at the
		      last minute to switch back to an earlier design for
		      my web domains...but this was only due to the fact 
		      that the videos were not playing in opera mobile browsers-
		      they seemed fine on chrome and the desktop version of
		      opera and safari mobile...which is prolly still the case
		      as i hope opera mobile will return to normal...so all
		      i did was that and eat leftovers with lettuce then
		      a bag of chips and a cute chunk of gouda...sprite,
		      coffee, cigarettes, and scales...it even felt like
		      too much of a task to bathe...although i did shave...
		      spirit of lynch perhaps, the solitary ant crawling
		      around my cellphone out of nowhere...they were sugar
		      ants but they were coming in for water, he had said
		      once upon a time...i had recently read laura's letter
		      with feelings and memories so exact that no one could
		      believe me if i told them...my conflict with this arises
		      from the michael j anderson slander and the julee cruise
		      rant although in her case it was later edited down so
		      that it is not easily found online whereas the man from
		      the other place was basically silenced by itself being
		      so extreme as well as by the lack of response it got -
		      jennifer did argue against it but i believe she is the
		      only one...i note these things as conflicts within myself
		      because i always felt they, not jen, were sort of the 
		      pieces, important pieces, that belonged to lynch, that
		      were part of him or his persona if you will...if you
		      look for the dwarf it will only say he is 'retired' and
		      the crooner will say she committed suicide while listening
		      to the b-52s' roam...yes i know this must not be interesting
		      to anyone else yet my emotional investment in the lynchian
		      universe is left with that chaos...i've always felt his
		      characters were a sort of family - i suppose it still makes
		      sense given the turmoil within my actual family...i suspect
		      this will never be resolved...maybe i should consider it 
		      'nonexistent'...now these thoughts are shared to also clarify
		      why i gave mja space in the list while dedicating the song
		      to dl and "liking' so many tribute posts at instagram...
		      one and the same, it was about the arm and the giant...but
		      that is  how i saw this 'giant' director and him...to think 
		      of it he saw it too, otherwise why would he cast the arm
		      atop the throne of mulholland drive...let me conclude this
		      with a quote from it, "You want me to make this easy for you?
		      No fucking way! It's not gonna be. It's not easy for me!"
		      in my dream there is a big plate of bacon although i have
		      been keeping kosher for sometime now, as i eat i wonder if
		      it is the facon that i heard emily speak of...i don't miss
		      it and this is also the case with most food...i suppose
		      i see it as a mere necessity...something to do while watching
		      a film...i left a short film called the death of a shadow
		      when i realized it was a short film...even if it did seem
		      enticing in some ways...like meat-flavored ice cream, i
		      think well i like short films but how will i ever get around
		      to them or worse list the ones about writers...and if so
		      would one not be forced to include social media tapes in the
		      category...i can hardly do my job in terms of tvc15...
		      when i looked it up, i noticed a dozen titles but then as
		      i researched i found there is no end to it not now with
		      the several many prodco's spilling out a series every 
		      couple of days...later in my dream, i am standing in a
		      room where a man has just been murdered, they are putting
		      him in a sort of duffel bag or heavy trash bag that is
		      tightened by tape at the ankle torso and neck areas...
		      i guess we are going to dump the body in the nearest 
		      lake or river...perhaps ocean...somehow i am neither
		      surprised nor interested in the proceedings...i had gone
		      to complete harlot's ghost yet i found i had actually 
		      read most of it and it wasn't helping my inertia -
		      turning to the letters of shirley jackson i started
		      thinking of cake as she mentions it and put that away
		      as well not wanting to excite myself over the only
		      food i actually craved a few months ago...maybe i have
		      simply read too much and need to press pause on the books.
		       
		       
		      25 january 
		       
		      dream of no easy situation - an airport it seemed,
		      all the luggage is on the floor...there is a man
		      that would appear to have been looking through them -
		      he is now in a squat beside a large collection of 
		      lipsticks as if inspecting them - it is then i say
		      something not audible enough to recollect as he
		      removes some of the caps and flings the lower portion
		      in a manner that can only be described as disdain -
		      i believe it is at this point that i got up for a second
		      to turn off the fan as i actually felt the cool sweet
		      air of winter...the lights had gone out before i went
		      to sleep but not more than half an hour...earlier
		      they had been out for three hours...i felt as if
		      it was some sort of signal...i had mostly escaped
		      some caravan song blaring out on the street and
		      even the mobile aguacate vendor shouts as well as
		      the compramos todo lo que sea viejo mantra with
		      murder on the dancefloor headphone playing...a
		      signal that the intrusive sounds are required?
		      well, the lights go out now as i tyoe this -
		      i flick ashes into my coffee instead of ashtray
		      in the sudden darkness - the bar game we played
		      on doped dummy's when they turned their heads...
		      over the hills and faraway - where was i oh yeah
		      faced with the non electric chunk of time i washed
		      my hair and watched 'ace in the hole' - a pretty
		      worthwhile study of character and intuition...
		      somehow it was getting late and i went into
		      my scale ritual then bed fromw which you already
		      have the scene noted...later i dreamt i was 
		      shopping naked...didn't feel strange as i 
		      pulled at bags to gather the goods except then
		      it wasn't groceries but gaby or gabriella...
		      i guess i need to find a middle ground name for
		      her since the first feels too informal and the
		      second quadruples the syllables...i think it
		      is the only time i have dreamt of her...not
		      much time to play or pal around as some strange
		      and strong man insisted on displaying his talent
		      of twusting necks - the ghost of burt reynolds
		      said something but i could only think hey it's
		      burt reynolds...you know fangirl syndrome - anyway
		      one guy gets his neck twisted and seems to die,
		      then another stands before the strange strong
		      man and the same happens but this time he props
		      him up and twists again until the poor fellow
		      returns to life or at least what is left of 
		      life after a near death experience...somehow
		      this leads to me buying a suit, i am trying on
		      a quasy fancy teal blazer and i tell the sales
		      person that the sleeves are too long which he
		      refutes - showing me that he is wearing the same
		      jacket and it is fine on him failing to take into
		      account that i'm 5'7 and he is at least 5'9 maybe
		      six feet tall...we wander over to find a replacement -
		      now back at where i had got the bags - the strange
		      strong man is surrounded by law enforcement agents
		      and pulls out ice skates to cut the soles of his
		      feet, i notice them bloody and think he is going
		      to launch himself into battle, his type of warpaint
		      i suppose...i woke up not really caring to find out
		      what became of that brute...a sigh moment after
		      typing that sentence the lights flip on...my eyes
		      adjust...my only plan for the day is to avoid the
		      delivery of cash that was sent despite me insisting
		      the money be used to hurry the arrival of my new
		      guitar...in my calculations it seems logical...get
		      it monday after i know the box is on its way. 
		       
		       
		      26 jan
		       
		      about yesterday, how could i ever call that a day?
		      it was a saturday, yet minutes after typing that
		      note, there it was again another lights out moment
		      that lasted hours leaving the soup incomplete...
		      the only bright spot was avoiding all the noises
		      via headphones yet even that was soured by the
		      return of the delivery man as if intent on seeing
		      me...shouting the name he thinks is me and somehow
		      getting in the building and banging on the front
		      door...i was playing scales which i actually did
		      thrice while waiting in the dark...thinking why
		      would someone do that without first confirming
		      via phone...it is the usual proceedure...olives
		      chips and cheese with a lukewarm sprite as i 
		      watched the linguini incident, am awful movie
		      that has one magical scene where the lead actress
		      questions how many would like to see her drown
		      and turn blue at which point the real wife of
		      the lead actor raises her hand...it's a howl!
		      by the time i got to the soup i didn't want it
		      but had it anyway for the sake of nourishment -
		      the awaited package did not get past set up and
		      is supposed to go out today or tomorrow...i was
		      neither disappointed nor surprised but sort of
		      weirded out by how the whole day went...anyway
		      it will still take a couple of weeks to arrive...
		      dreams never arrived except for a very clear
		      and nearly impossible vision of a man that i can
		      only describe as a santa claus type, marx every
		      body nose there ain't no sanity clause, uhm yea
		      white hair and beard in a glowing living room
		      with a fireplace chimney like i have never seen
		      before...it was nearly shocking as it made me
		      think of the letter jfk wrote to that child who
		      asked if there was such a thing...i awoke with
		      everything feeling far away...even the coffee.
		      on my second cup, i suppose it would all be all
		      right if in fact lotta didn't feel so far away...
		      i am about to look at her new video now, it 
		      seemed unusual that she showed no enthusiasm
		      for berlin, no reaction in a sense...in fact
		      she posted a scene from the rose club instead -
		      i don't know how i remember such details yet
		      i can only imagine that i do for some specific
		      reason...now sunday, which turn will this take?
		       
		       
		      27 january 
		       
		      what was sunday, well it started off weird
		      and nearly desperate although i'd be hard pressed
		      to offer explanations...like awaking to a feeling
		      that the day has already paased you by, left you
		      too late to catch up...how strange you may ask,
		      well to jizz in the pants while not exactly 
		      excited while sitting down is how...then i
		      planned a night full of rain along with rice
		      and steak yet i couldn't get through it and
		      i didn't really want to go back...i gave up
		      and took a nap wherein i dreamt i was fixing
		      a shower...standing in water facing three
		      shower heads one of them was overloaded with
		      frames, like eight by ten picture frames,
		      i removed these and showed them to someone,
		      an older man that was not pleased and threatened
		      to fire me...maybe in some dream world i am a 
		      plumber...well knowing i have no career ambition
		      in that area i return to the showerheads and
		      slide them up the wall, they are all spouting
		      or squirting if you will...i remove one and find
		      a flexible hose which i put place in mouth as
		      one does when siphoning gasoline...i am surprised
		      then that i can breathe perhaps believing myself
		      underwater...i awake and see lotta's shower...
		      it makes me feel more in sync with myself and
		      i even find a guitar case sale which i jump on -
		      five or six guitars with only one case, obviously
		      i need help...but then seeing her praise some
		      tv actor takes me all the way back to too much
		      heaven and i let the song float around for a while
		      even looking at the chords...pictures of you by the
		      cure might have been more adequate yet not as pleasant...
		      i go to sleep feeling like a peasant in a kingdom
		      which taxes and takes no notice of peasants...
		      i dream of the now antique batman, specifically
		      adam west...yet it's all vague...nothing to report,
		      it is my preferred batman in terms of style and
		      writing...those scribes never got enough credit...
		      although their scripts are the blueprint for the
		      caped crusader's empire...i suppose there were
		      other scenes which simply escaped...i only recall
		      the vivid replaying of one of my songs - dialdialler,
		      or some may think it is called high fidelity...
		      so i awake at least feeling all right about the music
		      except was the whole week about some wicked doppleganger,
		      youtube video ad twice seen parents telling a child
		      we never told you you had a twin sibling...good
		      grief charlie brown...did the act of giving my
		      plumber shoes turn out worse for wear...is the road
		      to hell paved with good intentions...and why did
		      bat token make it a dispute in refusing to deposit
		      the final pay out...the browser row rekindled while
		      searching for a replacement to opera mobile...
		      i research butter now unwilling to study porn
		      for the previous fright, i am looking for the
		      golden canned one with a cow's head on the label,
		      i might be mistaken over the bovine but not the 
		      light bronze shiny color...i come up with golden
		      churn butter and wijsman but think maybe red
		      feather has a new label...anyway something like
		      this might be an option since they have a long
		      shelf life...moreover, i found there is a such
		      a thing as powdered butter which supposedly one
		      merely adds water and voila...who knew? leads
		      to the trite what will they think of next...
		      wait i should have said beurre bretel instead
		      of red feather but since i am not certain of
		      the pronounciation i will let it be...i will
		      conclude this particular note with the buffalo
		      lament, we all saw the ball hit the ground but
		      the refs now seem to allow the chiefs a completion
		      as the nfl appears to want another taylor swift
		      super bowl...it would be shocking if jane's addiction
		      had not wroted 'nothing's shocking'...
		       
		       
		      28 january 
		       
		      tuesday. i should clarify 'a night full of rain'...
		      it was interesting however i might not have been
		      in the right state of mind to enjoy it, so i left
		      italy of the late sixties or early seventies only
		      to return to italy in the forties...that is to 
		      say; across the river and into the trees...
		      obviously for danny huston but as i watched i
		      found i could not turn away from viewing...it
		      is such a gentle poem which contains such harsh
		      and rough lines, like a wood carving...for most
		      of it i did not recognize matilda perhaps too
		      thrilled by the plot and how i understood nearly 
		      all the native talking except when the black shirts
		      stood by the cafe speaking...anyway i really liked
		      this one even if the ending matched what i was 
		      expecting, i suppose i didn't expect liev to be
		      that good and deangelis was great...there were
		      moments when her expression said so much, well
		      her eyes...yet let me not over do it as i don't
		      want anyone looking at it as if it needs to be
		      true for them, that was my truth in that point in
		      time, i cannot guarantee such magic for anyone else -
		      for all i know, you might prefer ' a night full of rain'...
		      which i left after only a few minutes...
		      monday was the day the money came, it reminds me
		      of the mae west quip when she is told ten men
		      are waiting for her and she says send one of them
		      home because i am feeling a bit tired...i ordered
		      a coke and non menthol smokes, since pepsi has
		      basically been outlawed here and the sweet cigarettes
		      were going too quickly...all week i awoke as if 
		      sleeping strained my back and then sit worried, smoking
		      and wondering what on earth is going on...like there
		      is an invisible jigsaw puzzle which then leaves me
		      reluctant to engage with the rest of the day...what is
		      that horrible word i hardly ever use...ah yes lethargic.
		      a few minutes after the soda and so called cancer sticks,
		      the pizza arrived, luckily i looked before unlocking 
		      the door to see yet again someone intent on mixing in
		      behind the delivery as if i was also greeting them...
		      enjoyment seemed out of the question as i face the
		      pie thinking of how late it already was which then
		      translated into staying up way past my bed time...
		      in feeling i had to finish seeing the film, then
		      finalizing the new domain designs and augmenting
		      the cinema list...finally in bed, bowie songs
		      i had heard the day before howled in memory -
		      as if the time i knew that delivery was knocking
		      returned like a spiritual investigation...i guess
		      there is a danger in handing over a piece of
		      identification to receive them dollars...but 
		      there is no other logical way to do such things...
		      well, not until electronic currency becomes the
		      standard...i went to sleep sort of praying that
		      the box had been picked up and was now on its
		      way...christmas in february...i hesitate to continue
		      since i don't want to name the actress i was thinking
		      of then possibly dreaming of but honestly i think
		      there was a message and i don't know who those women
		      in my dream were...all i know was one was blonde and
		      the other not so blonde...if brunette or even darker
		      hair i cannot say...she was extremely happy with me
		      but i kept wondering why the blonde was upset as it
		      seemed to have something to do with me...something
		      i did or did not do? she only walked away when i tried
		      to ask...if i let instinct have its say, well then 
		      obviously i have put placed lotta well beyond what
		      would be fair in terms ot attention and so jealousy
		      might be the easy answer...there have been days where
		      not much gets done other thinking of her...this stems
		      from other questions i cannot quiz myself with and
		      expect correct answers as well as the blurred stance
		      which cannot lean into an exact emotion given all
		      that has transpired. not just with her, but with
		      myself. not to mention the impossible situation
		      which has no way to balance itself in terms of
		      'family' life and the utterly ironic fact of folks
		      then disguised to dismantle affection for their 
		      own favor. in other words, situations i cannot
		      control and once in a while make me jump to 
		      conclusions that drift too far away from the rational.
		      from the real. if nothing is good or bad based on
		      thinking or point of view, there should be no feeling
		      involved yet since we all know there is - there are
		      emotions, well - it must be
		      that ol willy shakes was partly mistaken in that
		      particular line...
		       
		       
		      29 january
		       
		      i always like to celebrate bridget's birthday and although
		      i didn't want to explain the bathing gif i find myself
		      compelled to mention it because the next film i viewed
		      happened to be ladies of leisure which somehow had
		      barbara bathing that in turn consumated varda's idea
		      for me; 'cinema is my home, i think i have always lived
		      in it'...in other words i felt as if the films were
		      speaking to eeach other and for a minute allowed me
		      to listen...now then yesterday, i uncluttered the
		      balcony - moved one of the sofas and found a listin
		      diario from 23 august 2023...hidden under the seat,
		      given the date it could not have been mother or
		      the related guests that got to visit last fall,
		      2024...it certainly wasn't my doing...it would
		      be an unlikely scenario to consider that skirt
		      pawed the paper into the couch...which leaves only
		      the intrusion of someone invading while i was out -
		      that particular wednesday was pretty eventful,
		      not to mention it would have been soraya's birthday -
		      even here a sort of hurricane was twisting the wind...
		      no matter, as much as i want to think of it as a 
		      message, the raid fact diminishes any logic, if 
		      someone can't pick up a phone or write a note -
		      well in this case possibly simply knock on the 
		      door it obviously implies something that cannot be
		      good - cannot be intended to help but to hurt -
		      i came up with this later as at the time of the
		      finding i was very intent on doing some cleaning -
		      the living room and dining table were next, i
		      stepped into the kitchen listening to rockabilly
		      and also got that done, even set myself up for
		      laundry and disinfected what is usually called
		      here the maid's quarters...i have been purchasing
		      litre bottles of coca cola to line up against the
		      woven metal back door and gate - both of which
		      have, i estimate, enough space for creepy crawlers
		      to slide through, i think there are fourteen now
		      and i have three more in reserve...anyway, for
		      some reason i wasn't hungry the whole day -
		      and so i continued my clorox party into the 
		      main living spaces and then the bathroom - meaning
		      yes i got most of the house in order...i need to 
		      find a way to cover my shoes...the dust somehow
		      accumulates with such insidious speed...but in
		      not wanting to use bags, i wonder what options
		      remain...eating my pizza at what would have
		      been an hour before midnight in sweden, i liked
		      the feeling of clean although i loathe the act
		      of cleaning for the fact that it merely requires
		      more cleaning before long...i suppose in contemplating
		      all this it was midnight here before i could finally
		      fall asleep...i don't have any dream to report as
		      the scenes were vague...getting up again i had a
		      memory of being in some sort of bar or club...women
		      therein as if evaluating themselves in terms of 
		      who i like or love...my erection wanting to be pleased
		      but also wanting to pee...my inclination for fantasy
		      put aside in considering it would be noon time elsewhere,
		      naked peeing worried that there would be bleach residue
		      upon my soles since the tiles still felt moist, i dressed
		      for coffee and smokes, the cell rang, no lettuce and
		      no rosemary...what could i say...all right...the order
		      will arrive anytime between now and eleven...i let go
		      of some aelf coin to get ondo...the box was collected
		      and is scheduled to arrive in two or three weeks...
		      i am hopeful about this haul yet it also makes me feel
		      selfish, as if i were too rich or something although
		      it is not exactly the case...i guess i have misjudged
		      my self love, maybe i need to love myself more and
		      merely rejoice in the material possessions that are
		      coming...likely the catholic mindset, heaven and 
		      eyes of needles and camels or whatever it was...original
		      sin and guilt...gulp, i gallop through lotta's latest
		      posts...not signing up for her handmade hair brush
		      giveaway slash raffle so as not to make her feel any
		      pressure from me...oh but they are so lovely, still,
		      whatever i do for her i do freely, the courts have
		      said marriage is no longer sexual servitude...the 
		      nerve! of course, it is otherwise what is the point?
		      ok, ok, if an asexual man marries and asexual woman,
		      maybe that argument has a leg to stand on...i surrender,
		      dear reader, you got me, yes i miss the golden olden
		      era of slavery. in fact, i can't imagine how we've
		      all gotten along without it. 
		       
		       
		      30 january
		       
		      well, on second thought, we haven't...a lot of structures
		      are so based on it that the work still stands in a sense.
		      to leave the frying pan and lean into the fire, robots
		      are the easy answer...i see now that i am not the only
		      one that senses the need for that...automated machine
		      servitude already has a long history...yet this is only
		      a random thought which flowed out of sarcasm...
		      imagine if the all the jews had to go back to egypt!
		      a word to the wise, don't get too sarcastic with ai...
		      it's thursday, i don't want to write about babygirl -
		      i did not enjoy seeing the beautiful nicole appear
		      older...vulnerable...at the start i felt a tug or
		      perhaps it could be termed a wink at eyes wide shut,
		      but the woman has more power now except there is a 
		      glitch in her that propells the narrative...i suppose
		      one could argue over the brilliance of the quirky
		      metaphor but for myself i had to skip over the 
		      father figure song and dance sequence as it felt
		      as cornball corny as denying the minimum wage is a type
		      of modern slavery...anyway her acting was like always
		      sublime yet i didn't feel that level of emotion with
		      the other players, the husband seemed confused, last
		      to know syndrome, antonio hit the highmark with the
		      commercial boy on his lap going this child has a tumor -
		      meanwhile the lover had this split personality question
		      and smirk which looked like someone high on certain
		      drugs...still i liked the early collage with the 
		      dog hovering over her on the street and the seemingly
		      extasy riddled club date...but as the culmination fight
		      fizzled out and life went back to normal for lack of
		      a better word, the implication baffles...that is the
		      lover now alone in a hotel room giving the dog quality
		      time...although it gives one a reason to want to look
		      at nightbitch - which i haven't been inclined to view -
		      it does not make sense - well perhaps to people who
		      really like canines...if memory serves kubrick ended
		      with the child sort of dissolving into the department
		      store...this was also christmas...the doctor's wife
		      saying we need to fuck - an ending which does not lose
		      its grace even if it is a curse word, you could watch
		      it ten times and the charm sticks like he knew somehow
		      that even if he had a hundred variations there could
		      only be one way - a sort of cinematic alchemy. now i
		      seen one reputable reviewer term babygirl as bliss
		      and i seen the australian say she never had so many
		      orgasms...my apologies to tom and keith for even 
		      mentioning that in passing...however or despite those
		      opinions, i didn't find it sexual per se, in fact i
		      wondered much more about her ears as if that character
		      had worn heavy earrings for too long. in other words
		      this is no sequel to the masterpiece mentioned but
		      a pretty strange plot with a near enough hollywood
		      ending which might have been better served by one
		      of the characters being murdered and perhaps a court
		      or insane asylum ending sequence with or without the puppy.
		      hush puppy - if only they had picked rough boys instead
		      of george michael - oh well, pete isn't lucky with soundtracks -
		      don't mind me i'm only waking up and suddenly feeling my
		      dream vanish...in it i was being chased, i felt fear and
		      still feel a bit nervous...i haven't looked at the news
		      yet although  i did look at lotta's new postings...i love
		      the way she looks when rising in the morning...donnerstag
		      i think is the german word...i hope i can return to my 
		      schedule, cleaning the house and then laundry yesterday
		      took me further into undefined distractions...of course
		      more money or even a simpler say one bedroom place would
		      solve that but to clarify i don't want to be so rich,
		      only wealthy enough to help others and have more guitars. 
		       
		       
		      31 january 
		       
		      after another slightly unusual day, i mean i went back
		      to sleep dreaming in what seemed to be london wherein
		      a fat man was trying to massage lotta and i was upset
		      then upon an avenue partly crowded where i noticed
		      a naked girl sitting on the street as if oblivious
		      to her surroundings as a walking girl said something
		      along the lines of he's looking for gold, i thought
		      she meant me yet of course it could have been meant
		      in terms of someone else, i turned then looking more
		      at the building structures and thinking about my 
		      pants wondering if the penis was getting an erection
		      or if the erection was subsiding, a mid-term in 
		      between bop which obviously confused me...i awoke and
		      thought about it for a while...without conclusion 
		      except marianne faithfull died...from what i read
		      it seems she suffered greatly in the last few years -
		      i was suffering through the lillian gish film although
		      i wanted to see these actresses i did not want to be
		      reminded of what both my aunt and mother are going 
		      through...i left it before an hour had passed and
		      don't really want to return...i had a light meal and
		      planned to pack it in early as it were, playing through
		      the twenty scale ritual and some chord shapes, i 
		      tried to hypnotize myself into slumber yet the dona
		      leida was being shouted as if buzzers and phones were
		      illegal so i struggled through that sound in my head
		      as if suddenly empty of thought...i suppose since i 
		      can no longer count how many times that stranger has
		      yelled out to be let in...a bit later in sleep again
		      i dream i am chased...awaking as if wounded by nerves -
		      yet the scene blurred and dissolved leaving only 
		      the anxiety as i thought it is probably too early
		      to start the day, in another dream a woman i do not
		      know is buying glasses and suggesting i should get the
		      same ones...i explain that i do not like the style -
		      the optic man was then angry and started on a rant
		      about how good they were and how fairly priced they
		      were at this point in time, i shrugged repeating i 
		      simply don't like them - walking away with her next
		      to me i notice they are raybans and have second thoughts
		      about not getting them but i still feel them as unattractive,
		      i think i already have raybans as i now walk in a snow laced
		      street alone, it seems to be 109th between columbus and
		      amsterdam and i am considering how to navigate the crossing
		      as the snow has piled up and it looks as if a nearly 
		      frozen river lake has formed - a grey mystery that might
		      be hip high i evaluated avoiding it by swerving wide -
		      i enter a shop and find myself counting the dollars to 
		      pay, a hundred and fifty dollars, maybe it was a tom petty
		      honeybee dream, but what was i buying...whatever it was
		      cost more than that and i awoke before finding out the
		      outcome...the obituary party was in full swing as sometimes
		      occurs at the passing of someone important - muhammad deif,
		      loretta ford, wolfgang zweiner, and dick button...i considered
		      the last three for a minute...i want to wrap you in plastic
		      and put you in freezing water...sheryl doing david's voice
		      in a video i saw after natalie...memory of her 'ugly' scene
		      in we are the sickest band movie goes like lightning through
		      memory reflecting how i feel once in a while at cell camera
		      glimpse...u-g-l-y, you aint got no alibi, you ugly your momma
		      says your fugly...1986 wildcats...dick laurant is dead kicks
		      off the spiral in lost highway and that comes to mind upon
		      the button note...i bring it up because it is exactly part
		      of the point here...i think scientologists call it an engram,
		      a phrase, a set of words, or even one word might in fact
		      trigger unimaginable effects...giving weight to burroughs's
		      hypothesis that language is a virus...i next ring up 
		      why some folks need you or insist without exact logic for
		      you to mirror someone or something...conformity i suppose,
		      the status quo...i haven't mentioned it but recently have
		      felt that pull...yet the put down goes further back - 
		      a control mechanism that concentrates on some flaw or
		      even false vision to bury self in despair or at least 
		      doubts...which in turn makes one feel as if proof or
		      some substantial reaction would be needed...of course
		      in logic, i know that i needn't prove anything having
		      possibly accomplished more than i ever imagined except
		      for climbing the mountain of unedited manuscripts in
		      that suitcase which i keep waiting - as life has given no 
		      quarter yet to settle that score...excuse my untimely
		      rant, now as i consider these things i think my concern
		      is precisely or only those voices, hmm, those eys without
		      faces, that further the insanity by insisting it is all
		      to help you or the like...yes, similar to a 1940s skit
		      going do you have two tens for a five...which i might
		      further make more ironic by underlining the missing
		      fifteen by which i mean aunt;s house. 
		      
		       
		       
		      february 3/4 2025
		       
		      wordstar.nexus dreamnweaver note will be updated
		      soon...i was about to dress up the waiting page
		      with a few words but after watching myrna loy
		      and ian hunter, in 'to mary - with love', i 
		      thought i should not rush through...there is
		      a scene where they, as mary and bill, are smoking
		      in the dark so one mostly only sees the smoke...
		      it was 1936, i dare say it is the greatest single
		      sequence involving cigarettes in the history of
		      cinema...john cromwell directed that - sydney
		      wagner was the cinematographer - mark lee kirk
		      was the art director - and ralph dietrich was
		      the editor. even in my sloppy print, it looked
		      magical...outstanding.
		      post-script; i am considering put placing
		      the earlier dream notes and other content
		      here; https://wordstar.gitbook.io/inkrealm
		      
		       
		      february 5 2025 
		       

		      that kid from wahoo nebraska sure put out some
		      fine photo plays...burroughs happy birthday
		      viewed the 1920s as a doorway...i feel pretty
		      fine when the 1930s proves me right...i was
		      thinking of jennifer singing take me back a
		      minute ago - charlotte rampling we like
		      especially because she seems to carry that
		      aura from those ancient times...it has only
		      been a few days but trying to recall the 
		      events feels like searching through antiquities -
		      there is no law i am breaking by missing a
		      dream, but somehow it feels criminal...
		      allow me to slip start by not a dream but a
		      glance...at a glance, there it was, the most
		      evil thing i have ever witnessed...a feral
		      cat had caught a rock dove either right there
		      adjacent to the back door or carried up from
		      the ground level - i;m on the second floor -
		      a feather in its mouth, the pigeon in pieces,
		      i didn't want to study the scene yet i do 
		      suspect it was feeding upon the capture...
		      it stayed there a while as i disinfected
		      my side of that area and now all that is left
		      are the remains of the bird...my own cat
		      kept away from the mess yet he did display
		      a bit of a frenzy as if celebrating the 
		      murder...the killing brought to mind the
		      black crows' remedy...i had actually heard
		      it the day before...a look at the lyric will
		      mafe the reference self-explanatory - 
		      make...there is no math for visions...
		      they tell me maafe is peanut stew...
		      i suppose i hesitated to jot the dream that
		      made me pause...i was in bed with robyn,
		      both of us nude, touching her i praised
		      her skin and she was self effacing pointing
		      out some acne here or there to which i 
		      responed with temporary logic, not a flaw...
		      she was on my right side hovering to the
		      left as i awoke feeling bewildered by 
		      still sensing the actual touch and then of 
		      course a bit baffled expecting it would
		      have been lotta...still it killed loneliness
		      like that auslander killed the bird...
		      skirt once caught a bird yet in such a gentle
		      way that it was able to fly away when i picked
		      it up...no other dream to really note, there
		      was a scene wherein a man was trying to sit
		      on my feet, looked like a nephew, there was
		      a vibe like some girl had been cheating - 
		      awaking to the no logic frenzy...another
		      where someone was visiting, a stranger in
		      a suit...he went right into the bath - soaking
		      there all dressed up...it was awfully unexpected -
		      like an extended dream conversation which feels
		      as if someone is merely extracting data let us
		      term it a download dream...possibly why the song
		      don't start me talkin' i'll tell everything i know
		      was wroted...wiretap paranoia might expand to 
		      unimaginable scenarios when you consider ai 
		      is able to clone any voice...so while i did have
		      at least one other dream to mention, i motion
		      against it given the fact that i am not certain
		      if in fact it was a conversation or a set up -
		      the next feeling inertia and worry mingle and
		      that horrific sensation that one has been replaced
		      by someone else - in this case specifically i mean
		      folks involved with my sister...don henley plays
		      dirty laundry...what is it akin to, well it would
		      be plausible that the number of surrounding juans
		      is an area scheme in order to mask under the 
		      nearby church and school...normally it would
		      seem only logical to be surrounded my marias...
		      i've met more marias in the soviet lands than 
		      all my time here...hmm be that as it may, i 
		      obtained a couple of india eisley films -
		      american outlaws...simply terrible save for
		      her self yet even herself was overwhelmed
		      by her tits...no wonder actresses are now being
		      cast as chairs...we are not going to speak about
		      my furniture...it was a true story but her 
		      counterparts failed horribly in caricature instead
		      of craft...you feel the stupidity much more than
		      the history which is constantly floated by like
		      a hallucination motif...so i had little hope
		      for every breath you take and i was not disappointed
		      as it was also pretty bad although by some luck
		      there were no breast on show...again, the cardboard
		      cut out acting by her costars and the gullible nature of her character that
		      is to say bad writing leaves one dismissing it as
		      soon as it is over...maybe her beauty is a curse,
		      oh we can cast her alonside any old hack and if
		      all else fails...tits...but she's above average
		      and it is tragic when these sorts of contradictions
		      present themselves. i was then trying to see one
		      called adolesence but it was not available...
		      maybe things will be better in chicago...to my
		      shame i did not think of anne marie when the
		      faithfull news broke - more in morin...suddenly
		      i saw i was right, in paying attention to a
		      muse or to a self, i left something so cute
		      on some shelf to collect dust as it were...not
		      that there was anything i could do or wanted
		      to do but it underlines the previously mentioned
		      irony...in this case, i had only thought that
		      lotta could learn a thing or two in terms of her
		      desire to have a bakery...yet in looking closer
		      i realize she is the only girl i have come across
		      that loves tennis...blinded by the light?
		      i did of course think of marie anne, yet in the
                      end there are no words for that kind of emotion.
		      for someone attempting to be gentle, it might
		      be viewed as intrusive...for someone avoiding
		      irony, it might be manifested by being invoked
		      through words...so wishing her well from a safe
		      distance was where i settled...what does anything
		      mean? one report spawns copycat headlines yet
		      there is no silent option, is there? so no need
		      to ask why joni was caught in the devil's bargain
		      trying to get back to the garden...i was caught
		      up in an all night investment plan, by which
		      i mean 'coin' - a couple of days ago and i suppose
		      i need more time to balance into what has
		      become my usual schedule...anyway the system was
		      merely moving one token to a new address - mostly
		      due to the fact that one place has possible earnings
		      where the other didn't...these transfers are often
		      lightning fast yet in shuffling through what are
		      named seed phrases to exctract from various installed
		      'wallets' well it is a task...still, nice to see
		      new earnings nearly instantly...i don;t expect 
		      too much from these things, the motivation is to
		      leave a substatial enough fortune for whatever
		      loved or beloved ones remain...so that they
		      need.nt be concerned by the economy. it's like
		      my stock holdings, i'm sure it will come in handy
		      further down the line...for them. 
		       
		       
		      ten february 
		       
		      i had a nearly logical urge to fix up my main room
		      as i expect one of the new guitars to arrive in the
		      upcoming week or two...mission accoomplished, but
		      there is yet much to do in terms of uncluttered goals.
		      i kept thinking it was january and someone;s birthday
		      for some reason awaking today to see that emilee's
		      birthday didn't cross my mind...which might explain
		      that disaster dream wherein she seemed to be with
		      me at the liquor shop...someone had aaked for wine
		      and i looked in the fridge container for a bottle...
		      this upon the heels of literal cat nap, skirt seemed
		      to be fighting with the pigeon eating feral cat and
		      i was rushing to protect him when i noticed three
		      other cats transform, turned winged, and flying...
		      one of them turned back and looked to be stuck in the
		      metal of the back door...squeezing out slowly as i 
		      awoke...an awaking to merely freak out as a wedge of
		      orange rested at the whirpool door...the thing was
		      it felt as if someone had been there and that paranoid
		      feeling continued to creep around me even into the
		      next day...no daddy or dad wanna be is allowed into
		      the water closet, violent dream - who are these people
		      that think i am like them or that they have been invited...
		      suddenly the apartment feels like a wrestling match...
		      i feel bad over slamming his head into the wall, but then
		      as if blending scenes i wonder if someone came in and
		      slammed my head into the wall...they say it's gas,
		      bubbles in the neck...something must have happened...
		      there's been talk of real estate and i have even felt
		      the eviction sensation although it is illogical when 
		      one owns the property...no landlord, no worries in that
		      sense even if bullies want to blind the facts...then
		      again i must take into consideration how some folks
		      insanely identify with a place - buying and selling
		      it as  if souls were involved...here you go; rent out
		      my cousin or aunt...haunted or mirrored, hounded in 
		      error...perhaps that is wahy i had them chased dreams...
		      invasion of the body snatchers redux...anyway no goodly
		      dreams to report, even lotta said she had a nightmare -
		      oh wait, margaret i did dream - her eyes mystical -
		      she was dancing and it was another transformation
		      dream like josie trapped in the dresser from twin peaks
		      instead this was shiny silver metal yet i could still see
		      her eyes...i thought of the melted magnet liquid i used
		      to play with as a child...it felt childish to indulge 
		      myself in all six thin man films yet in the final 
		      evaluation there is no better series of films in terms
		      of sequels...at least not in the rom-com detective genre -
		      the thin man, after the thin man, another thin man, 
		      shadow of the thin man, the thin man goes home, and
		      song of the thin man...i simply adored them even if the
		      last one made me over think and the ending was not
		      what i expected unless i consider that they were 
		      putting the franchise to bed...uhm the overthinking
		      was about don taylor playing buddy hollis...a name
		      too near to buddy holly...his previous acting credit
		      had been 'time to kill'...a short film, preceeded by
		      'winged victory'...well, you see how that sort of
		      thing could get one's mind worked up...sure, imitation;
		      life and art...well, there's something ironic given
		      the otherwise joyful conclusions in those films...
		      myrna was not shy about playing the vixen, i viewed
		      thirteen chairs and indecent -aka, vanity fair - but
		      i think i mentioned that here already...i did want 
		      to mention emptying out the bench to bum rush the
		      opposing team in the first quarter but they got by
		      without that strategy...although i am tempted to 
		      type that the nfl was merely paying heed to public
		      sentiment...the real superbowl ie, detroit vs
		      buffalo must have been playing in the dreams of
		      true fans...now then, two skinny girls retro classic
		      slide instrumental, laudanum, will be re-released
		      any minute now...here's hoping your monday is moving
		      along happily.
		       
		       
		      11 february
		       
		      dream said i was walking in a city beside
		      what should have been a park or garden yet
		      was much more of a forest...there were signs,
		      they indicated via insignia or logo that the
		      area i had wandered into was occupied by 
		      a military force...soon enough encountered
		      men in uniform...i carried a backpack which 
		      i haven't for some time...one of them sat me
		      down in what i think thwy call a mess hall,
		      a sort of dining area more like you would find
		      in jails or school cafeterias than actual
		      eating places...he insists on seeing what it
	              is i might have in the bag...based on the 
		      principal of privacy i argue against the search,
		      although i actually have no idea what might be
		      in there - positively something trivial given
		      my response - his response was to empty out
		      all the contents of his pockets as if to say
		      he had nothing to hide so why should i...as
		      i am about to explain my shyness, a fidel 
		      castro type saunters up behind me and leans
		      against the chair i am in sitting on - he
		      reprimands the soldier man and also mocks 
		      him insinuating he is a homosexual, meanwhile
		      i am keeping still thinking i always wanted
		      to meet fidel castro, but he then grows louder
		      remarking that he is not a homosexual yet 
		      runs off removing his pants to join the crowd
		      of soldiers that were the counterpart of the 
		      man that wanted to rifle through my belongings
		      - as if to leave the statement as sarcasm or
		      at least a question in the air of listening minds -
		      in another dream i am being driven in a vehicle
		      to what felt like some clandestine operation,
		      or even a heist...there is someone next me and
		      we are holding hands...the way children might...
		      when the destination is gained the hand holding
		      leads me in the opposite direction promising
		      to be with me all the way then suddenly disappearing -
		      at which point i find myself climbing an entrance
		      gate...ala river cartwright in france - a slow horse
		      not knowing what is on the other side...hundreds
		      of crawlers swarm the ground and i worry they
		      will get at my ankles yet they swim past as if
		      intent on leaving those grounds...i see a corridor,
		      it is glowing and my grandmother is there yet
		      as i attempt to get her attention i notice she
		      is blind and possibly deaf...she is moving things
		      around with a dancer's motion, carefree, and i 
		      move on to find the party i was with only to 
		      find myself in an apartment - peopled by more
		      than i could count much less recognize - a woman
		      now in front me seasoning meat as if trying to 
		      show me - to my left is lotta yet she is not 
		      near and in conversation with someone else - 
		      i awake remembering something about a kitten 
		      or cat that had a jack on its side and i plugged
		      in a cable the way i would with an electric guitar -
		      i stumble out of bed concerned that someone might
		      be using gadgets to pass himself off as me - 
		      a vague memory of an old galaxy android came to 
		      mind - gary  plays john cheever in the
		      film i am in the middle of but what keeps going
		      through my thoughts is how similar celeste is 
		      to margaret and thus the question of previous 
		      dream...could it have been foretelling this 
		      film or was i right in thinking it was merely
		      replaying a variation on a film i had recently
		      seen many times...there is no right answer and
		      i settle into tuesday knowing i will not know. 
		      one last thing, the scene after climbing sure
		      brought to mind the triple note by the tree
		     intimacy dream and pre-dream it was the very first time
		      i thought of anya although i had her image
		      put placed atop the inkrealm cloud space for
		      months which i switched upon the maria thought -
		      the weird part of it was that it was like being
		      cornered into a usual or habitual thought sequence
		      which was entirely foreign to me, i mean of course
		      i like and admire her yet that is not exactly
		      translated in thoughts which have been otherwise
		      engaged...later looking at her pictures i find
		      that parts of my thought sequence were even 
		      accurate, i remembered from the generation p
		      article her friend and recognition fired up 
		      within my looking eyes. in any case, alike the
		      margaret/celeste puzzle, this also has no resolution. 
		      not that i ever mind thinking of pretty girls...
		       
		       
		      february 12 
		       
		      indeed, what else is there...now then to elaborate
		      on the "cloud" it is merely being grateful for the
		      inspiration i found in moscow, in saint petersburg,
		      in samara, in volgograd, yes russia...at the time,
		      history will prove the vilification of the former
		      soviet empore as if insanity prevailed in the press,
		      corporations exited, sanctions punished the innocent,
		      and everyone seemed to turn against that land...i 
		      was looking at the hermitage museum at finding
		      shostakovich was from that city...how does one 
		      explain that place...let us say some people awake
		      there thinking they are in paris france...but back
		      to the point, so the "cloud" was also a protest
		      as i feared for these girls and hoped it would 
		      help them in some way...i got up in the wee hours
		      thinking about the dream i had...a girl dressed in
		      yellow rain coat with a matching hat looked extremely
		      happy to see me...i would not find it weird except
		      i know i can sit for hours at my desk never thinking
		      of anything or anyone with any joyous greeting...
		      in any case, it seemed she kept moving from standing
		      in front of me to being a picture or video streaming
		      on one of my cell phones, at some point i picked up
		      the other one to film her...i noticed i was on the 
		      big mattress that somehow got lost...the one i had
		      wroted private area upon...it could be that someone
		      kept it instead of the story i was fed...lotta seemed
		      to feed on a hamburger and fries, later asking why
		      she was having trouble sleeping...i stumbled around
		      hoping she would get some rest - but i haven't been 
		      able to think her as i did before the christmas party -
		      it has become a sort of flip frenzy image invitation -
		      wherein other girls feel as if i am leaving them out
		      when they have every right to ask for my attention...
		      in some cases, i suppose that is true, in others it
		      might be my own fault for looking...except in all logic
		      no one can keep to one thought twenty four seven...
		      not that it really matters to her or to them...
		      it is only a high strung sensation i keep trying to 
		      tune...of course there is no correct tuning for an
		      instrument as delicate as the mind...i suppose most
		      folks would understand this in terms of faith...a
		      heavenly divinity and the multi-faced distractions
		      of sin for lack of a better word...don't get me wrong,
		      i am not actually worried. in fact i only got worried
		      while thinking of going to the bank - itself a minefield
		      of dress up and locking up this and that before arriving -
		      the worry eased upon the knowledge that i needn't hurry
		      over my deposit plan or anything related to that...
		      besides what if the expected haul arrives and i happen
		      to be not here - i continued watching the italian film
		      deciding to savour it by sections...so only halfway 
		      through...i think i miss reading and desired to return
		      to the wagner book that his wife wrote out for him...
		      it is shocking to me to have felt such a connection
		      to him in reading his word story...not as shocking
		      was feeling cosima nearly resembled lauren sophia...
		      i have other books to get to yet nothing that feels
		      urgent...they say if you took the time to look at 
		      each painting in the hermitage it would be eleven
		      years before seeing all them...i translate this notion
		      to books knowing it is important to decide which ones
		      to timeshare and perhaps especially which ones to 
		      revisit...is wagner revisiting? did i read enough
		      already? well, not if i feel this way and certainly
		      there is a second part i left for later being convinced
		      that in some ways i was reading about myself...
		      bell jar syndrome, when else does this happen, rarely...
		      lotta does not like berlin and i felt a pain in my
		      left bicep as i settled into the scale ritual...
		      somehwere in the dream both arms were in pain and
		      i sensed i was with family members but it was all as
		      vague as the fog in a hazy london evening...my wristwatch
		      had stopped in that dream i lamented having to go out
		      for the battery...it was too soon, i thought...now i 
		      think of lotta's expression, the drained social battery -
		      dsb is both a railway company and elsewhere a bank...
		      in reaction to being uncertain over which path to take,
		      i prepared and re-released "exile's letter" - thinking
		      in the future i will doulbe up on the releases and make
		      them a set of two so as to sort of match the name of
		      the band...two skinny girls - a two song album...well,
		      i;ve had worse ideas...whatever, the wristwatch was in
		      fact all right and my arms lost that bizarre sensation -
		      i should type that i feel the dsb even before getting
		      done with plans to go banking, shopping...excuse me
		      i think i want to listen to a bit of nick lowe.
		       
		       
		      13 february 
		       
		      i needn;t explain this or that yet on the off chance
		      that somewhere clarity is required, well it's like
		      i'm speaking to myself here - there is a thing that
		      you will not be able to recollect ffrom the fleeting
		      images of dreams, from the overly populated imagination
		      later et cetera and sometimes in the act of the jot
		      i don;t pay heed to the form or even rush in typing
		      so that for example i might miss telling how the
		      resemblance is only an outline since each lady has
		      her own distinct beauty...
		      i later dreamt of arriving at a sort of crossroads,
		      it was a much broader avenue than i have ever been
		      on but from my question it would seem to have been
		      manhattan, which way is sixth avenue and having
		      learnt the path from some stranger bystander i 
		      turned to gain ground on fifth avenue...please note
		      in my experience there are parts divided by a park -
		      can't recall if sixth is literally the continuation
		      of central park west...no matter, getting there
		      i find a woman walking two lap dogs...i had reluctantly
		      started to like dogs since seeing asta who i believe
		      was played by both the daddy dog and his puppy son -
		      terribly cute...they are friendly and don't seem to mind
		      me then at the doorstep she is asking me if i am free
		      on satruday when suddenly a karla surrounded by a group
		      of girls appears behind a gate alike the tony roberts 
		      obituary picture which held woody and the holy diane
		      well karla eases into my side, i think i notice a 
		      belly piercing but i am more concernd that she is 
		      drunk and about to slide onto the ground as if melting -
		      saying you can't date her i want you with me on saturday -
		      i do not know what to say...i get up and now thinking of
		      ian hunter's central park and west along with the grateful
		      dead's one more saturday night even if the song that
		      held my attention most recenlty was a jockey full of bourbon
		      by tom waits...i suppose the music comes to mind after finding
		      a certain scale which is said to incorporate five scales
		      in one but more interesting to me was the added notes
		      which line up all the notes in any key as well as the chords -
		      that is to say pretty useful for improvisation and writing
		      if one were to keep strictly to the notes or chrods in the
		      scale...it was happenstance, someone named andrew clark,
		      so i decided to learn that, it's like a big blues and
		      eight note box with two notes on top of wherever one
		      decides to play it so key of E starts at the tenth fret
		      and so on...weird the things one misses but yeah that is
		      the only tip that made any practical sense other than
		      the very pleasant stitchmethod guitar guy that has
		      a masters degree in jerry garcia...usually there;s a 
		      lot of crowded words with little meaning so i felt it
		      right to mention them...of course to really learn i
		      would only recommend watching what john 5 does...yeah
		      it's heavy but unlike metalheads he does not shy away
		      from slowing down once in a while...in my excitement
		      i brought in the dominant pentatonic to the roster of
		      daily ritual...i don't know it yet but i that was how 
		      spent most my day...thinking well i will prolly not
		      need so many scales but going for it with the logic
		      that to continue in this fashion makes sense as every
		      time i have missed a day or two i always notice the
		      truth in what jerry said...it's like a bridge, a place
		      to gather one's self...at this juncture my only real
		      issue is the argument of speed...but i feel speedy 
		      enough when it comes down to it and i know i don't 
		      want to impose  a playing style upon myself that
		      in the end could only be useful for a few songs...
		      in that sense, perhaps it is why i only know the
		      outline of some solos without seeking to replicate
		      them...a cover band is not in my to do list...there's
		      something about substance over flash i suppose...but 
		      i've most likely said too much on the topic - 
		      i hesitate now as i struggle with the italian in the
		      film i am viewing...as if saying i understood that
		      other movie voided my roman ear...i woke up near to 
		      hunger...ordering, reluctantly, chinese food, justifying
		      the cost by thinking the leftovers will balance it out...
		      i went to sleep again after another round of scales and
		      nearly only thought about lotta...yet it is still some
		      sort of frenzy in my vision...reflected in my dream
		      running around in what must have been an airport shop,
		      strange word duty free i don't like it although not
		      as irritating as diatonic...i don't know why...uhm
		      yeah i remember trying to decide between a mint 
		      listerine and a regular one...all the while packing, all
		      the while worried that the plane was leaving without
		      me - when two suits settled in taking a eyeful of
		      my old tamrac camera case...they sat next eachother
		      on high stools...i was explaining how i could not 
		      explain how the dust gathers inside a window shut
		      room and how they might want to remove some of the
		      messy particles before going further...they looked
		      like they were from some federal agency...as if one
		      had been cloned to get a perfect partner...who could
		      argue with himself...i turned away to continue packing
		      and to check on the departure then awoke - someone 
		      i had not met had actually taken something from that
		      dusty container about the time the gas line next to
		      the stove was punctured...here's the problem with
		      being raised catholic...even in dreams one might be
		      polite or even nice to people that deserve the stark
		      opposite...it was too early to make sense of it all...
		      not that i wanted or wished to...there was a late 
		      notification that made it seem as if lotta had just posted
		      but at three in the morning...studying the matter i saw
		      it had been from eight thirty. someone on social media
		      detailed the process of vision with an emphasis on how
		      much we miss from the broad field which is reduced and
		      translated in the mind which returns it to be seen perhaps
		      understood...that might be the situation with any given 
		      guitar scale...the connections, to me feel endless, that 
		      is the potential sequence cannot be seen entirely since
		      selecting one run leaves all the other races still in 
		      place...we see a series of notes yet there are unlimited 
		      options. in any case exciting or exasperating depending
		      on one's point view. one might venture to say jerry's
		      continual search for new methods was merely limiting
		      the exasperation. hopefully that is true for myself 
		      as well, ah look valentine's day coming in soon...
		      union station kansas city missouri mass shooting
		      parade anniversary no i didn;t know it was a dj
		      that had been killed...much less by a man sharing
		      the name of my favorite rock and roll spinner...
		       
		       
		      15 february 
		       
		      dream conversation with lotta, her face looks
		      powdered, i am telling her she is fine without
		      the tanning effect...i don't hear an answer -
		      i don't get through the italian film leaving
		      the last few minutes for the second viewing -
		      i decide the film is like a dream yet i can't
		      place the actress as she, celeste i think her
		      name is feels so familiar...i come to the conclusion
		      of sonia as a last resort...i browse through the
		      reviews, they are all curving on mixed, they
		      mostly implying it is sexist...i think of the 
		      kids in the hall skit now, yes my film is a 
		      very sexist film...well, the film is once
		      in a while sensual...yet even the critics can't
		      help mentioning kubrick and lynch when speaking
		      of it...it is that visually stunning...the giant
		      laughing child of the professor that sits couch
		      potato like in front of a television is the
		      kick in the pants for me, there's no definition
		      or description that could explain those minutes
		      as it conveys so much in itself...so when the
		      beauty employs the word beautiful it is itself
		      an ending - perhpas i wanted that to be the ending...
		      although i didn't consider it until the present...
		      in stark contrast, the gorge, the next film i 
		      viewed went some ways into excitement without resorting
		      to the gimmick of nudity...although nudity has a hard
		      time being seen as trite...hell, even wardrobe malfunctions
		      make the news rounds...lotta said her legs felt naked
		      in spandex, i felt naked upon awaking yet i actually
		      was...i had dreamt of galvan - thinking how difficult
		      that type of job must be...well, like an influncer
		      always needing to be on point...the last couple of
		      times i thought about filming myself i have encountered
		      an against it sensation in the fashion of suddenly
		      not feeling presentable...spiral into rabbit hole
		      debate about being vain, self- absorbed, et cetera...
		      where was i, ah yes, i found that film thrilling if
		      only for the fact that the main characters literally
		      fell in love...not to mention the chess scene which
		      serves to remind one of the queen's gambit...now
		      then, saturday - story ideas i will not write one,
		      yao restaurant poisons writer and strangers mock
		      him for being ill... sotry ideas i will not write two,
		      publicity lawyers for democrats haggle with the 
		      new york post over the price of a feature article...
		      story ideas i will not write three, man speaks to 
		      a female relative via telephone, the relative kisses
		      her husband and the man feels the presence tingle
		      upon his lips with disgust. the triad in simple
		      terms has a minor third and diminished fifth...
		      i don't know when i first saw the crossed out
		      circle symbol or how i remembered it when seeking
		      to update the circle of fifths diagram...
		       
		       
		      16 february 
		       
		      didn't i stack pants in my 3k closet, the dream
		      reminds me...or perhaps it was lauren sophia and
		      her design seven slacks...that apartment suddenly
		      a school - i am dressing, the detention lady is
		      standing tall in the hallway - i turn to look away
		      from her - emilee is behind me, smiling, smiling
		      before braces, i want to say i don;t know if this
		      is real...i get up and play scales concentrating 
		      on the dominant pentatonic, i go through the ritual
		      then slide through all the diminished chords only
		      liking some of them...i return to bed partly thinking
		      of the word be-love-d, bed love, a term helena was
		      using, there she was nearly showing her b, but i 
		      thought it weird, like a hidden hurry all very cute
		      yet clandestine...if he were you wouldn't you be
		      honoring her in your own profile...well, it is 
		      safer thataway, i suppose...what lennon said, 
		      hide your love away...i drift off to dreams
		      without giving further pause to any of it, hopefully
		      everyone is happy in their own space and time...
		      the dream then turned out to be too much for me
		      to handle...lotta had moved in and we embraced...
		      we were caught trying to decide what to eat...
		      she had had tacos in a video i viewed, rubbing
		      her belly in satisfaction as if to fuel the fire
		      within brooke...i speak out what could make a menu
		      from the stored fridge and pantry items...she pulls
		      out a fish from the freezer and then another fish,
		      one is red and full bodied, the second is a couple
		      of headless fish, some sort of filet which seemes to 
		      be her choice, standing in the kitchen i am telling
		      her that was the most wonderful hug i have ever 
		      experienced...the door rings before she responds but
		      i start to fret that she does not feel the same about
		      the embrace...a group of men stand at the entrance,
		      one handing me a guitar that is packed too lightly 
		      and the other pushing in the box i suppose i am
		      eagerly awaiting...a third man puts a box in my
		      palm, i open it as they leave but have no idea what
		      it is...the weird fate to behold and expectation
		      and not recognize it...i don't have time to spend
		      on the puzzle - wanting to return to lotta - 
		      yet somehow there are visitors in one of the rooms,
		      sister is now in the kitchen explaining the situation,
		      from a glimpse they look like some sort of boy band...
		      sister's daughter is also in the kitchen kneeling
		      in front of the stove...i hear someone at the door 
		      again and find one of the locks missing, replaced
		      by some rinky dink padlock, finally returning to
		      lotta, she explains that she didnt have the key...
		      so i don't mind it so much...yet there is another
		      knock on the door, i am starting to get suspicious,
		      men are going back and forth up and down the stairs,
		      as if trying to peer into the living room...a strange
		      man in uniform appears and everyone steps aside, there
		      is a counterpart with a similar get-up, he is almost
		      singing, announcing himself as a captain yet as he 
		      nears i notice it is a salesman, not caring for whatever
		      it is that he is peddling, i shut the door but find
		      my bedroom door ajar and one of the laptops opened...
		      inspecting it i find someone has fiddled with it and 
		      it is in the process of re-establishing itself, the
		      screen looks sleeker more modern in some way...still
		      i am upset but the boy band is rushing out before
		      i can get a word in...i reprimand my sister for
		      allowing such chaos and pour water on her daughter;s
		      head knowing it would or could dismantle her hairdo...
		      all at once it feels like a very long time has elapsed -
		      there haven't been any boy bands she knew since menudo -
		      it takes three, four hours to fly from the city to here,
		      much more from sweden...yet i get up finding it has only
		      been a few minutes...half an hour certainly no more than
		      an hour...it's the middle of the night and i don't
		      know what to do except maybe clean the kitchen which 
		      leave for later, putting it on the back burner as it were -
		      i didn't want to love lotta yet in some partly selfish
		      way i do...evaluating the scene i see myself as hyper
		      in contrast to her cool stance...i see myself as too 
		      eager to please her when possibly i should not optionize
		      in order for her to please herself...maybe it was the
		      first time we met in some other life and i was merely
		      being a kind host...the minutes crawled, an hour later
		      still no clean kitchen...scrolling through social media
		      i hear tom waits' green grass being covered by a woman
		      intent on playing it with barre chords, i want to say
		      something to her about chord shapes, but when the lyric
		      arrives at if the sky falls - mark my words, we'll catch
		      mockingbirds...i sense that the bond track was lifted 
		      from this poem...one's in C minor the other in A minor
		      while both have something identical in terms of feeling -
		      gemini flash tells me it's possible yet impossible to 
		      prove...the thought takes up another hour as i listen
		      to his recording and also a live version...i suppose
		      there is nothing to be done but even if ai disagrees,
		      i do think or to be more exact feel it was lifted...
		      in any case, or otherwise, i feel all right...i suppose
		      dreaming of her sent me miles away from loneliness,
		      set me up to even clean the kitchen in the wee hours. 
		      please note maise williams has a film club ! dang 
		      why doesn't someone tell me about such tidbits...ps,
		      if i had to be concise about it, this particular 
		      dream scene was like kia jade's little girl picture
		      with tee that either said angel or anger and i 
		      couldn't tell if it was heavenly or mad...
		      
		       
		       
		      19 february 
		       
		      dreamt next to a girl, like someone i met, 
		      she is very near and i am looking at her
		      passport...it's filled with grey and green
		      holographic images, body grey, hair parts
		      greenish...none of them are clear - sort
		      of outlined, sketched and in motion, gifesque
		      as if she is dancing, a few imply nudity...
		      i pull out, from the first page, some items
		      she has stashed there, cards, a fragment of
		      an id...she in turn gives me a picture of herself
		      then of some other girl, darker like a vampire -
		      i recognize the image but vaguely...i awake
		      to no certainty, all at once distracted by my
		      waiting for the guitar and haul to arrive and
		      recollecting an earlier dream wherein a dog
		      was trying to bite me and i forced its teeth 
		      into itself, teeth like the dark girl, sharp
		      and long....to think of it that was strange
		      considering i had found something akin to 
		      affection for dogs after seeing asta and
		      son in the thin man movie series...i started
		      to watch all is well but that didn't go so well -
		      the brutalist went a bit better, yet i cannot
		      fully understand its logic...it's not direct
		      on many levels and i believe it was trying to
		      shock the audience more than once as if story
		      would not suffice...one likes it yet as it is
		      not a true story one has less to hold on to in
		      terms of liking it except for craft...in another
		      dream two fender basses have arrived, i had one
		      that came in a nice leather case which was later
		      given to a cousin...in the dream it seems to be
		      him judging it as i remove the strap for some
		      unknown reason...in retrospect i cannot say who
		      it was except the words were not in english -
		      i got concerned that someone had tried to spy
		      upon my new axe before it arrived...the only
		      thing that has arrived so far are a few roaches
		      seemingly desperate to munch upon something...
		      even skirt's milk plate...even after cloroxing
		      the floor...very strange, i had the sensation
		      they had gone through the eyes of some onlooker
		      possibly envious of the cat enjoying kfc...
		      in another dream i am once again with lotta and
		      she is saying there is a steam room in the gym
		      and they drove down...yet i awoke then to imagine
		      the rest of the sentence...sleep let me slept
		      a lot except today both anxious for her trip
		      to hamburg and a third turn at berlin as well
		      as knowing for certain the delivery could be
		      any minute now, well day time hours...so up
		      all morning then a proverbial cat nap of 
		      an hour or less afternoon...barclay is a bank
		      i think, but in a different dream i thought
		      it barque lee or so...i was at three k leaning
		      against the door perhaps holding it against 
		      intrusion...yet unlike the actual door, there
		      was a space i could see through...there was 
		      a kid there he seemed upset over living in 
		      such a place and rushed out to what looked
		      alike midtown explaining to the thin air the
		      type of building he wanted then pronouncing 
		      the barkley sounding word as if breathing life
		      into the idea...i stood there watching, something
		      appeared to be under construction yet it was reddish
		      in plastic or perhpas blow up balloon material the
		      type one finds at used cars dealerships waving whatever
		      way the wind breathes...i suppose it was one of sister's
		      kids, but an insane version. i wouldn't know...as if 
		      in response i later dreamt that i was making a call to 
		      her yet one of her exes picked up the line and i pretended
		      to have no idea who i was speaking to as i left a message
		      for her that i had telephoned. to skip back a second, 
		      berklee comes to mind...possibly in augmenting the 
		      scale ritual which is a type of construction i have inadvertently
		      laid down the foundation of something that is flimsy...
		      or someone wants me to feel that it is not built to last...
		      anyway, there is that quirky twist where the names of the 
		      scale are usually several and of course berklee varies the
		      definitions possibly in mixolydian being termed locrian although
		      i couldn't tell from memory, i label them with the common
		      name and note alternative names when interesting...speaking
		      of music, the mentioned 'laudanum' has been delayed...i did
		      not understand the question, and defined it as being the way
		      it should be, given that it had already been released...
		      however, i was informed that 'exile's letter' is now available
		      again...

		      20 FEBRUARY<BR>
		      <BR>

		      i might have regained the schedule i feel a preference for...
		      the day was decidedly weird, i watched the last showgirl -
		      while washing dishes and wrangling a steak onto a plate
		      with the dead bugs rice and a sprite...it baffles me that
		      rice does not exactly freeze...i always liked pamela because
		      there was always something gentle about her nature...yeah,
		      gentle yet carefree...this movie was not gentle and felt
		      crafted to make a specific point...billie gave it an 
		      excellent balance so even the parts one sees coming a mile
		      away don't feel so wrong in the end...it must be better than
		      i am implying since the first hour flies by in a flash - 
		      it was over before i had time to serve myself at which point
		      i returned to manhattan melodrama and man woman or teen am i
		      glad i did although i was a mess of tears at the end...
		      it should be illegal to view such fine fare from the 1930s
		      in the midst of what is being touted as terrific...neither
		      the brutalist nor the last showgirl can rival it and that is
		      truly saying something...i wanted to end the day there yet
		      restlessness had other plans...plus a call with background
		      talking took its toll in displacing me beyond pleasure - 
		      i got up from the failed nap to kill another two roaches
		      in the kitchen - i went through the scale ritual and had
		      an inclination to investigae sweep-picking, in a sense it
		      is like re-learning the entire rhythmic process, what i 
		      found is nobody tells you that it is sort of backwards or
		      inverted, that is to say - for that type of playing which
		      speeds up certain phrases - one actually is required to 
		      slow down and steady the right hand strum nearly contrary
		      to logic...i got the gist of it in one pattern but soon
		      lost the flow as if it would only show itself on a whim,
		      yet in trying it with my own invented pattern (using the
		      same limit to save strings as i do with scales) i found
		      something i rather liked but have yet to decide if adding
		      this would work for me...i might not have the patience
		      in my right hand to settle down that much...to go in the
		      opposite direction of what feels natural...when i finally
		      got to sleep the dreams did not feel natural - one aunt
		      was sitting on me and i could see myself shirtless in 
		      a mirror's reflection writhing in pain, then another
		      aunt handed me a two story frame sort of like a flattened
		      doll house...there was a devilish demon in the top box
		      seemingly passing gas right onto whover was in the lower
		      box and that party appeared cramped and filled with
		      sorrow - i believe she also handed me some money and 
		      after contemplating the bizarre duplex, i walked down
		      the hall as if going to my room but one of my uncles
		      got in the way, this getting in the way became physical
		      and i pulled off part of his nose as if it had been
		      glued on without giving it much thought and escaping
		      to my destination except of course at that point i awoke
		      thinking how weird that had been...as i write it now gogol
		      comes to mind...i guess some folks have no sense of humour-
		      although excited to see that i had partly reclaimed my
		      hours, i stayed in bed and then dreamt of three different
		      types of food...a woman stood beside either a turkey or
		      chicken, there was an enormous pot of rice, and something
		      fried...i was asking her for all three and she gave me
		      a plate containing my request - except i didn't feel like
		      myself and actually did not want to eat and didn't instead
		      surveying the surrounding areas of the scene as if trying
		      to pin down who had pinned me down in such a mundane or
		      perhaps fat man;s dream...this all turned into watching
		      some sort of masturbation with someone hidden wherein all
		      i could see was a dragonfly emerging from a penis, repeatedly
		      well i told you it was a weird day...anyway yeah dragonflies
		      swimming out and flying...needless to say i was baffled and
		      awoke then, still sort of early and hopefully early enough
		      to get back on track...in pre-dream sequence thought i did
		      feel a squirting of sperm without motive or movement and 
		      the surprise of that moment possibly was the impetus of the
		      scene...that sounds strange uhm the origin of the species no
		      that would be worse, the catalyst of such confusion...burroughs
		      said he could will himself to ejacualte without using touch -
		      didn't think it was true until now. i don't want to ejaculate
		      via thought and or thoughtlessness although i do wish i could
		      conjure the delivery of my new guitar and haul just like that. 
		      
		        
		       
		      21 february 
		       
		      post- dream realization...maria has a dragon tattoo on the side
		      of her torso...it's like angelina's tiger except that is on her
		      back...the day went by mostly expecting the delivery which has
		      yet to arrive...at the end of it, after being enchanted by the
		      early parts of the western named the plunderers, i sat down 
		      confident into the ritual and then a second attempt at this
		      backwards method but when i got through the scales, it was
		      like being at the start...i was perplexed after coming up
		      with a self-invented pattern that played near perfect, there
		      i was trying to figure out how i had done it...the only difference
		      was that i had been sitting on the sofa whereas now i was on
		      the english dinning chair i continually borrow from the table...
		      it couldn't be that i said to myself putting the axe back to its
		      resting position...of course curiosity took hold and i tried it
		      again on the sofa without success...it reminded me of my 
		      struggle when i need to record a vocal without playing guitar -
		      which more often than not requires that i at least hold the
		      guitar going through the chord changes without ringing them up -
		      needless to say, i was highly anxious to give it another go
		      upon waking and yes in both seated positions, and no i did 
		      not get that wild groove that i thought was cool enough to 
		      continue the method...i am entirely not sure what it means,
		      my instinct tells me to keep at it and record to see if i
		      am simply not hearing the thing right...it is kinda quick...
		      in any case it might be that the weirdness continues...
		      in my dreams, i was directed to a room, it felt like a hotel,
		      i went into the room...three people on a bed...like a family,
		      a mother on the right side of a father and a grown daughter
		      on the left side...i could tell they were actors yet i cannot
		      say who they were...i neared to glimpes the father's forehead
		      which held little font letters typed...alike film credits or
		      studio branding - touchstone pictures...maybe since i was
		      near to anxiety over the guitar glitch, i now postulate that
		      some studios have robots in place all ready for extra work
		      and who knows what else...we'll save a fortune on catering...
		      dream going shopping and seeing sister buy a pineapple...
		      dream again in the living room except now there are dead
		      people there - that is in reality, in the scene it all looks
		      as if real time natural except for the dogs...the dogs race
		      through the kitchen and two of them remain at the back gate
		      door looking back in - like double omen german pinchers...
		      the woman is berating me over my diet and the man is being
		      no help - i try to answer either that i have never had 
		      much desire to have any meal or that i take vitamins in 
		      case my eating habit is not balanced...i got up then not
		      at all feeling easy, as it was more like meeting imposters
		      posing in bully disguise...i recall another scene, finding
		      a replica cell on the floor and turning it on then contrasting
		      it with the one on my desk...a boy stands next me nearly
		      annoying and squirming the way boys do when they need to 
		      pee, i tell him the bathroom is down the hall and thankfully
		      he leaves...i suppose i was shocked at not
		      finding the groove i thought i had learnt...retrograde?
		      a differnt me that missed that method meeting? perhaps
		      merely invisible intrusion breaking up my concentration...
		      well at least this western is one script that even licked
		      some of the actors - good golly, there is some great writing
		      in some of the lines of those early scenes. it's gotta be
		      one of the batman scribes, i think to myself. sioux teepee,
		      well it would have licked me too. 

		       
		       
		      22 february 
		       
		      that photo play was wroted by bob barbesh who did some
		      tv work although not the caped crusader...the film held
		      no further fine lines but it did have a cute twist...
		      i was pondering over the feeling or lack thereof regarding
		      native americans when out of nowhere i heard leonard peltier
		      had been finally released...also, to be clear i'm pretty
		      serious about that sixties show having wonderful writing;
		      "i'm not just pussyfooting around this time," - catwoman.
		      holy hole in the doughnut, what happened - asked robin...
		      i was playing the intended riff on the tenth fret instead
		      of the ninth where it belonged, but then i started to weigh
		      and worry over my right hand technique...i hadn't thought
		      about it since jerry said he simply held the plectrum like
		      a pencil which is exactly how i styled my strumming...yet
		      in researching the matter, i found this terminology...scalpel
		      picking, sorad picking...some insist that pulling the thumb
		      into play and angling the plastic is the way to go - it looked
		      like a good idea until some others insisted that this type
		      of torture will kill your thumb after repeated playing...
		      a riddle a day keeps the riddler away? i did chance upon
		      a good reminder of something i was only partly conscious of;
		      keeping the thing as near to the playing area as possible...
		      i studied some chet atkins and decided from all the sources
		      that i had to allow my wrist more flex instead of forearm
		      which is usually where i feel a strain...the thing that
		      strikes one about chet and even john 5 is the ease with 
		      which they transition from floating through the strings
		      to picking...as i returned to give some of these ideas
		      a go, i found - perhaps too quickly - that i don't want
		      to hold the plectrum with my index finger as indeed i
		      hold writing instruments between thumb and middle finger -
		      the scalpel or sorad way is much easier on the forearm
		      but i sensed pretty soon that it pressured my shoulder - 
		      also it seems too much thinking would be required to 
		      swiftly turn away from these inner curved hoverings
		      to say chord work...so no new ground gained yet in being
		      more aware of the action of the plectrum hand i feel
		      improved - not necessarily faster and positively not
		      near to an expert sweeping although without effect and
		      without muting i can see where i am making it more difficult
		      than it has to be...most people doing are employing distortion,
		      and many of them also mute by way of palm...i guess the great
		      thing about all this would be keeping my self learning...
		      indeed i was too self-confident and or set in my ways in 
		      terms of the guitar...
		      funny thing, due to atkins, i fixed one of those ring style
		      plectrums on my thumb and it was like magic...like an instant
		      return to where i thought i had reached...still, i don't like
		      the clamp feeling and do not intend to fingerpick...it was
		      what i first learned, and have some dexterity plucking that
		      way yet i really don't enjoy the sensation of it...
		      strange dream, girl posing for a picture, one of her tits
		      exposed yet she was curved in such a way that it was in
		      the shadows...i wanted to look but i didn't want to be
		      obnoxious and awoke wondering if she thought i was 'staring'...
		      sauntering in another dream through intricate pathways
		      of a hotel that had different elevators for specific areas,
		      it's me and possibly lotta or at least in my mind it was -
		      we arrive at the end of one of the elevator's top floors
		      yet still need to go up stairs, a penthouse, one would imagine,
		      there were very nicely carved wood doors leading to a bridge
		      like corridor filled with supplies for the guest rooms...
		      she was walking ahead of me through a maze of pink satin...
		      stacks of them, pillows or perhaps cushions...suddenly i 
		      am in front, another set of doors, i am reaching to see
		      if i have a key card at the sound of someone speaking about it
		      but find only what seems to be an id card in my backpocket -
		      there is a lap dog behind the doors and it starts to pee
		      foward more like a fountain than a canine...i see her nearing
		      except now being carried in a sitting position by a man
		      i don't recognize...she is resting on his left arm and he
		      his steps show no sign of effort...there is joy in her eyes
		      when she catches sight of me...a hotel maid is collecting
		      items from the room and i am now reminded of mila in some
		      movie i felt neutral about - maybe it wasn't lotta and
		      maybe i was only wishing it was - then who...well that
		      mystery has no answer presently...i got up then to give
		      practice to my research which you already have the conclusions
		     from in the earlier section of this scribbled thought-note...
		      swimming through emotional seas over what the scene might
		      have implied or meant i finally settled down and dreamt 
		      again - it was a race, i mean people were running and i was
		      too, i was running in the middle of them...it was not like
		      here with the race to see a lover, it was more like central
		      park except i believe i have only jogged in riverside park
		      which is really by a river whcih becomes clearer as one
		      goes down from the university area into the 80s and then 70s
		      where it seems to end at a pier...sometimes there were boats -
		      no matter, in this dream there was none of that and no one
		      i knew exactly...simply people running - a couple of them
		      speaking about a witch or witchcraft - a woman races ahead
		      and appears to be explaining something about the columbians
		      or maybe it was the venzuelans - either way it didn't make
		      sense and still doesn't although it does give further meaning
		      to 'everybody's talkin' which i heard a few minutes ago...
		       
		       
		      23 february 
		       
		      in the middle of a starman bowie nostalgic sensation, as
		      lazarus yet entrances my senses...the prelude sentence
		      is a quasi-apology in case this note makes not enough
		      sense...i'd been up a while trying to remember what i
		      was shooting at in some earlier dream then deciding it
		      must have been a mix up with some model talking about
		      shooting and my inner child with plastic green soldiers
		      went playing...i wasn't really sure what to do as i 
		      sat and pondered...i was very happy that lotta had had
		      a goodly great time with her friend...as for the concert,
		      what struck me was how gracie's strumming seemed like
		      a bird flapping in opposition to my idea about steadying
		      the arm and such - so being sort of
		      content until i found no one had mentioned wolf man was
		      a julia film, i didn't do much except create a new
		      design for one of the domains, mourn the story of
                      kadance...look here i'm in heaven the song tells -
		      fredickson i can't figure out why the name sounds
		      so familiar to my ears...mind's eye started a new
		      series of art posters in pin up style...i was pleased
		      with my persistence as gemini said no people i superimposed
		      the desired effect...square used to be slang for nerds...
		      squared away then thinking again of how to balance the
		      names of scales...amazed myself in not recognizing the
		      flamenco scale...perhaps i was drowsy by then, how cute
		      i thought only to realize it is the self same scale as
		      the jewish...more commonly phrygian, but also freygish...
		      circle of fourths furnished usually as fifths...
		      "A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away -
                        I drink some more and it's judgment day"
		      a hiatt song dylan covered with a blitz clapton solo -
		      years i ago i read a short story about some dude driving
		      with bob in a car that went off the cliff into a lake,
		      the narrator worried over drowning that great american
		      songwriter...i realized that might be the root of my
		      mext dream as i sort of identified with it at the time,
		      like the neil solo in chrissie;s down the wrong way -
		      the adf is projected to gain twenty percent of the vote
		      which is double what they got previously...i got wolf
		      man and hope to enjoy it later with a sandwich and
		      chips...burroughs had a datsun, i don't think mick
		      actually drives yet he was behind the wheel in my
		      dream and i kept glancing at him and then at the
		      road ahead in a concerned motion...you know some
		      people simply should not drive...i was asked once
		      if i drove and drunkenly i said yes of course - they
		      gave me the keys to some car and the task was to 
		      move it from the street into a parking garage - 
		      alternate side of the street parking madness - 
		      i still cannot explain how i managed it, everything
		      was fine which i suppose further proves my theory
		      that a lie can become the truth or the power of faith -
		      where am i going with this? i don't even know it's
		      automatic it's typing itself in a sense...in the
		      dream i arrive at a decidedly western town - as if
		      having gone back in time to settler days - dust
		      hovering on the unpaved avenue - i'm looking at it
		      perhpas feeling the anachronism...a swarm of mice
		      and crawling insects rushes through the place i 
		      stood - the scene from herzog's vampyre came to 
		      mind - kinski brushing away ganz...keith looking
		      at me like someone that had seen it all before...
		      i awoke feeling highly congested - shaking head
		      to clear nose - i drift back to sleep without
		      dreaming...awaking to laura sophia informing me
		      she lost her hair tie while on a sunday run...
		      i puzzle over the implications and or meaning -
		      my erection taking more than the left over coffee
		      and marlboro golds to subside...when i peed it 
		      felt like i was standing there for half an hour -
		      so there is a difference when one is let us call it
		      hydrated...i blame lotta's bottle but i am not
		      bothered...it's likely better to drink more water
		      than less...the rumour is that the expected haul
		      might arrive tomorrow, monday...i have made a
		      resolution to not party without miss mecey and
		      so needless to say if there is revelry she is
		      invited. excuse me now, i need to eat, care 
		      for the plants, and dedicate a couple of hours
		      to miss garner. 
		       
		       
		      24 february 
		      wolf man was not good, it was great...a howling
		      time...i got so excited i brought in two socks
		      from dances with wolves for the list art...
		      too great to sleep...i stayed up way late even
		      knowing that i should have been up early...then
		      i kept sleeping even past noon...i had deployed
		      my new vision of the site redesign and it mostly
		      a smooth process...it was my first time trying
		      deepseek, that via websim, and i liked how intuitive
		      it was yet each update took more time than usual
		      and i turned to anthropic's claude so as to put
		      it all together...minutes later, all i needed to 
		      do was add a few more elements but everything
		      worked and albeit yet a work in progess, i am 
		      enjoying it...i was not enjoying the news of
		      a slanderer being given an award by sag yet
		      later thought perhaps it is a put on, a joke...
		      i did love that demi won which felt like other
		      people understood the film as groundbreaking
		      in terms of genre...one might classify it as
		      a horror film or even another category like i
		      think the golden globes did, but it really
		      transcends all that in a sense establishing
		      itself like a forerunner for what follows it - 
		      my pre-dreams were crowded, something lotta
		      had said seemed to trigger a sort of chain
		      reaction...as the light rose, i knew my 
		      intended plan to be awake in case the haul
		      came in was out of the question - still, in
		      asking at the afternoon curve i was informed
		      that wouldn't be today...manifest destiny?
		      in a dream, a woman, i am not sure who, touches
		      my torso, her hands under my shirt sliding
		      this way and that, she is saying terribly nice
		      things to me...yet in not recognizing her, i
		      did not feel the emotions or excitement one
		      would expect...i like the song love the one
		      you're with yet in practical terms and it
		      seems in dreams or at least this one love
		      or even lust needs to be placed with a specific
		      person, otherwise it would be like that - her
		      getting lovey dovey gooey and me going how did
		      this happen...my silence in the dream preceeded
		      a series of scenes i do not at all recall - 
		      i know i was dreaming but i suppose my thoughts
		      were fully distracted, occupied with the worry
		      that i would miss the delivery thus extending the
		      wait, with lotta's trip back to sweden, with
		      knowing i had to clean the cat litter but didn't,
		      with another 'moderated' note which i later found
		      was over the 'album' cover art...i didn't want to
		      get into it and switched nora barnacle for some
		      1920s dublin church photo...my apologies to jimmy
		      as i feel certain he wroted that poem for her in 
		      his chamber music songs...at least for a while she
		      was on the cover of my goldenhair...weirdly in 
		      experimenting with strumming styles, i notice that
		      the lead work in that track must have been partly
		      a sweeping motion to get that trill - i remember
		      wanting to use a certain pattern of notes and must
		      have hesitated the strum while quickly trying to 
		      fret the right notes - i say this to myself noticing
		      how similar that was to finding that sweeping groove
		      and then having difficulty recreating it...not that
		      this a preoccupation no, since i don't sit around
		      later practicing the song after recording, it makes
		      sense...now later down the line if ever put place
		      together a song and then start practicing it only
		      to find some difference or difficulty in rhythm well
		      then i might have something to seriously consider...
		      based on the scale ritual i don't think it will be
		      a concern, beyond that once you learn a song it is
		      like a part of you...nearly impossible to forget like
		      some say about riding a bike, the balance simply 
		      returns out of nowhere even years later...why am i 
		      rambling on about this...nevermind, i didn't mean
		      to make a simple point into an extended paragraph...
		      prancing into the final stretch, i think of the 
		      line from kansas city, son of a bitch talks more
		      than i do...i light a cigarette, i recall someone
		      in the dream grabbing my left forearm and trying
		      to lead me somewhere - vague details no one i 
		      knew yet later memory said spence school cross
		      walk where the girls seemed to adore me but the
		      man grabbed me in that dream fashion except trying
		      to lead me away...i;ve lead myself away from the 
		      logic of this note...my point was to underline
		      how that film, wolf man, would make an excellent
		      starting point to study the wolves in film...but
		      also how it signals back to the logic of crocodiles
		      which is also named immortality...still, i am either
		      not quick or smart enough to see if i am right much
		      less to make connections that are sensible - anyway
		      it should be enough, even for my quizzing mind, to
		      say that it was an unexpected surprise...indeed, very
		      cool. 
		       
		       
		      25 february 
		       
		      i followed through on my plan, getting to sleep on time
		      despite having woken up only a few hours before...
		      i had been thinking about leni without a specific reason
		      or intent...well she was in lotta's video - then i dreamt
		      about lotta, this time nearly certain that it was her -
		      except it was in a most unexpected setting...a laundromat,
		      we were speaking and she had her back to me as if making
		      the sure washer was washing or the dryer was drying...
		      she was telling me that i was incorrect about her, that
		      most likely i wouldn't like her really or much less love
		      her...it was about the way she looked, i fixed my response
		      upon what i felt was certain yet i don't know why i was
		      touching her hair and face with such familiarity...if i 
		      met anyone it would not be in my plan to be so instantly
		      intimate ...she was dressed casually yet in a circled
		      reflection on one of the machines i could see her vaguely
		      or in some blurry manner without clothes which confused me
		      as it seemed contrary to the point of the dream if in fact
		      there was a point at all... i suppose i woke up then trying to convince her
		      of her own beauty and wondering over the reflection...
		      i sensed it would still be too early 
		      to start spending the day awaiting the expected delivery -
		      i drifted back into dreams with a sort of surprise close
		      up erotica as if i had gone down on some girl...pulling my
		      head back to peek at her pussy with a redness one does not
		      find in the common colors one encounters...some would say
		      pink, i don't know, i don't think so...pink flowers always
		      seem lighter to me...what i do know is only the devil has
		      more names than the vagina...as i turned to find out who
		      it might be or where i was in the dream, it all shifted into
		      another type of intensity wherein i was back in three k - 
		      in the main room before the furniture had been moved and
		      before mother rebuilt that antique dresser...father or perhaps
		      his ghost was going to bed but where mother usually slept -
		      there's someone with me i cannot see and i mention the placement
		      as if it were a scene i am directing, then like an actor or
		      maybe an obedient spirit, he moves to the other side, in a 
		      drunken slide motion - i feel a sense of comfort knowing
		      things are in place - then in the blink on an eye the bed is
		      crowded, there are kids there, not children, yet i am sure
		      not adults...they all seem hyper as if he were haunting them -
		      restless yet neither at play nor leaving like they are all
		      stuck there...i awake feeling weird over the vision - the
		      news tells of a bridge collapse in south korea...three dead,
		      i thought of mother's illogical and nearly hysterical arguments
		      over matters so trivial that their memory cannot be conjured
		      and how i wished i would have sensed her senility instead of
		      anger or trying to match insults...later the news reveals four
		      dead...the remnants of three k are in four d...it was about
		      two in the morning...bitcoin was making a scene yet i was not
		      inclined to think too much about it...i sensed a probing query
		      as if something or someone needed my reaction to father's
		      passing again, yet it would or will have to suffice once more
		      that there is none...the algorithm extends into chet atkins
		      videos as i find him saying everytime he looks in the mirror
		      he thinks of his father...i had taken out the hallway bathroom
		      mirror the other day...as if indeed the answer comes before the
		      question...then further, mariia ariia posted pictures of flowers
		      her father had sent and hse had settled into frame...
		      lotta says she does not have daddy issues, but i reckon we all do -
		      mashed potatoes and eggs, i was overtaken by hunger...morning without
		      mourning was rising, possibly it was lunch time in sweden...i plan
		      on staying up the next nine hours in wait unless i hear otherwise
		      or if by luck it arrives earlier than that...it all makes the day
		      feel much longer to be aware of what is missing as the minutes
		      tick away as if one were on a job...maybe it's how skirt feels
		      when i go to bed and tell him to watch the perimeter...hopefully
		      this will give me a chance to update some art in the film list
		      i have been planning yet waiting for a perfect feeling like
		      yesterday with julia...
		      
		  post script, there is was again the road to hell paved with goodly
		      intentions...late in the morning all my inspiration and 
		      desire to put place this or that here or there and even
		      anything else went into the not so wonderful wasteland of worry -
		      i will need to contain my sorrow as well as explain the
		      circumstances and situation as i am both too emotional 
		      to be coherent and also it would be wiser to wait until
		      hopefully i am proven wrong in this case...

		      having settled down in the afternoon, i went to sleep early
		      but found myself nearly chained by wrong number call i had
		      received...imagine racing to the phone expecting the courier
		      to say they are their way only to have to be reminded of 
		      someone you don;t necessarily even want to think of...
		      it was an unsettling type of bizarre...still, i struggled
		      out of the icky sensation dreamt...

		      awaking about two hours later debating on having coffee
		      or not...i would need to sleep a bit more in order to
		      allow myself to wait around again tomorrow which in fact
		      feels as if it had already started...

		      i was in a city, most likely a foreign place i had not
		      been to, at least not yet, at least not outside of dreams -
		      i'm with someone but i can't see them and we are standing
		      outiside some sort of quaint shop trying to get in but
		      it is as if we worked there...there is one of those rolled
		      down metal gates part way up implying someone was inside 
		      already - i try to look at who the person with me is but
		      i still can't tell - a man comes up to us placing two
		      dollars in single bills or maybe three, yes i think it
		      was three dollars and eighty five cents - the change in
		      dimes mostly and a few nickels...he is asking for cigarettes -
		      i look at scattered empty packs and find one that isn't
		      tampered with handing it to him...so perhaps in the dream
		      it is a tobacco shop like ezra pound wanted instead of
		      the pressures of writing poetry - now i consider it more
		      likely than someone searched my messy trash bag outside
		      and was excited by the marlboros although i doubt i would
		      throw away a fresh pack - anyway there are now a stack of
		      things at the entrance and the gate is rising...we are picking
		      them up and i notice one of them is a money box - i have
		      a sudden temptation to chisel a few bills from the top but
		      i walk in with it intact, hmm with its content intact -
		      then i am no longer there but again with lotta at a cafe
		      bar where the waitress suggests some type of mixture with
		      two different drinks, soft drinks, one of them coca cola
		      and the other some sort of tangy lime fizz...i mix them
		      differently know she likes coca cola more than i do - 
		      we sit there and the surroundings feel calm the air
		      pleasant yet when i turn to pay the wallet i pull out
		      is the brown one i possibly overused a few years go...
		      there is no currency in it except the bills from the
		      time i had carried around with me - somehow as i am 
		      explaining the irony to the cashier a magazine materializes
		      in my hands and the price on it is seven dollars so
		      i offer it as payment, it would be more than enough
		      and with a vow to pay the check anyway upon my return -
		      in the dream i did not return instead finding myself 
		      in some sort of party - lotta had checked into the 
		      stadshotell which i estimated at twenty minutes from
		      her house...but the scene was at some apartment, me
		      and a handful of very happy people who handed me
		      george w bush in a basket in which he sat in lotus
		      position as i then carried him trying to find the
		      right place for this presidential container that
		      would otherwise have been a floral arrangement...
		      i kept turning and looking for approval but awoke
		      with my left bicep aching...i thought briefly of
		      another anya who was happy to have a free evening -
		      i thought of lotta and soon after found she had
		      made a second video channel...'it was simply
		      a secondary personal phone' the punchline from
		      last year i never understood the hype over...
		      meanwhile we were all being swindled by democrats...
		      of course i am going to make coffee even if the
		      sprite is halfway swallowed...i;ve already unwrapped
		      a pack of marlboro and wroted this note in the hopes
		      of distracting myself for what i concerns me about 
		      domani as the italians tell it...i will haunt myself
		      for a little while and hopefully keep time with my
		      wanted schedule.

		      my apologies for the mystery, but everyone should
		      already know that timing is crucial and i don't 
		      wish or want to jinx the next day by a word tantrum.
		       
		       
		      27 february  
		       
		      how did it go...three women found dead in belize...
		      trachtenberg...hackman, wife, and dog found dead
		      in new mexico...it's gene i was thinking about 
		      a minute ago...realizing how it really is like
		      losing a part of the family...i love him for the
                      fact that a couple of his films made mother so
		      happy...now then, my word tantrum would have been
		      how my sister in a bonehead act went and shipped the haul
		      with the same folks that made us wait months
		      to deliver the goods last year...obviously why
		      i was so worked up with worry expecially since the
		      guitar was involved, in fact two guitars...the
		      other one sent out a week after...i must have
		      walked to the balcony view several dozen times,
		      before finally deciding to give up and give in
		      to sleep...it had been a very long day except
		      for a conversation with rachel, well possibly
		      rachel, since people have been known to pose
		      or pretend to be rachel chaleff for reasons i
		      cannot fathom...further into that last waiting
		      hour i got a call saying the package would be
		      arriving in half an hour...forty five minutes
		      later indeed it got here...i couldn't believe
		      it as i sat eating chessmen cookies instead
		      of a substantial meal for dinner...i waited
		      until morning to break out the axe...everything
		      seemed more or less in order but the pick guard
		      appeared a bit worn...it wasn't in plastic like
		      the pickups or the headpiece triangle...still,
		      a beautiful six string - for a while i was
		      more into the ernie ball everlast plectrums
		      and how the new slide fit my fret hand...i 
		      placed the shirley jackson id and the cover
		      of we have always lived in the castle stickers
		      between the pickups and under the part where
		      the strings from sort of a mini-harp...the more 
		      i looked at it the more i liked it - i even started
		      to dismiss the mess in my thoughts which found them
		      entangled with the delivery man upon going to sleep
		      and then again upon waking...so that i didn't even
		      remember my dreams...i hope it was that he was thrilled
		      by my very generous tip along with the potato chips 
		      and soft drink i gave him in the hopes that the other
		      guitar gets here carefully and before long - previously i had dreamt of
		      brooke who wears tattoos i remembered her first one
		      was dopamine chemical element and the last one i saw
		      was the pizza slice bicep...in the dream she has
		      on under one of her eyes like a an initial of a 
		      signature...the scene came to mind when talking
		      to rachel, happens to be brooke's sister's name too,
		      i thought of her umbrella photos and how she had
		      blood splattered beneath one eye...anyway i suspect
		      the cool thing about the rhoads jackson is how it
		      seems to urge one to play and explore the "lower"
		      frets, that is below the twelth...i've never experienced
		      that although i have yet to get it in tune and really
		      play it...i had also got a red strap but i feel now it
		      does not match...filling out the warranty i notice it
		      is guaranteed by fender, i suppose why they call it 
		      fender special run...i also notice how easy the waterman
		      feels...i got a few other things notably pepsi but i 
		      don't want to sound like i'm rejoicing or something -
		      if you feel tempted into envy or even sneering simply
		      say inky had to wait until february for his christmas...
		      my apologies if anyone was expecting all the details -
		      the rolling stones were correct you can't always get what
		      you want...i did get lotta's new english video venture
		      finding i had been pronouncing her name incorrectly
		      all these days and nights...i now pronounce you misaccentuation
		      and influencer...i knew the title of the clash's koka kola
		      yet doubted my own mind thinking who would name a song koka kola...
		      well two skinny girls called the song they we wroted with emilee
		      counterrevolutionaires which is up for re-release asap...i thank
		      rachel, chaleff not pufky, for the motivation in getting that
		      done. ps, those higher frets or lower as i call them are
		      more meaningful to me having spent more than a few minutes
		      on the acoustic wishing it were easier to get to say the
		      fifteenth or seventeeth fret when i only had the martin
		      to work with...wish me luck and pray for gene's soul to 
		      rest in peace alongside his wife and puppy, 
		      the world has lost a powerhouse.
		       
		       
		      six march
		       
		      i am tempted to actually revamp these notes and make this
		      a new starting point...it is wednesday and i remember -
		      with a certain degree of lament how weird sunday had
		      been...i suppose my own fault for thinking it would be
		      good to wait until monday to jot down the thoughts
		      that were jumping like improvised jazz in mind...
		      besides it was was the oscars and although i wouldn;t
		      be watching i figured it better not to make waves
		      against whatever that was or would be...i also felt
		      i had to wait and see what lotta meant by her deployed
		      jittery video which seemed intent on skipping past
		      the events she had pointed to earlier in the week -
		      notably le boheme at some opera house in sweden - 
		      i went to sleep partly pissed that someone yet again
		      was shouting at the exterior entrance of the building -
		      although i quickly dismissed the sound being self involved
		      within my self and all the things i had wanted to note
		      here it felt later, as i awoke, to have have shaken
		      up my peace...i had no precise dream memory and the 
		      next day a series of scenes were recalled which blended
		      into a blur each one lasting only a few seconds...i 
		      would term it a sort of imposed insanity much like that
		      senseless giddy feeling when the mind swirls without
		      any warmth in its journey - a cold hilarity that haunts
		      whatever tranquility follows...even lotta felt very far
		      away...at which point i was borderline angry - then
		      the market called claiming they couldn't get the smokes
		      i like...i was like great in the sarcastic sense and
		      settled the locks on the doors to purchase them elsewhere -
		      i picked a place that i had been to once before, the
		      customer service girl that looks like cristal...i couldn't
		      believe later that i felt her attraction but chalked it
		      up to my own skewed version of events...or perhaps it
		      was really cristal as that would make more sense...but
		      my idea was to smoke...the other cigarettes arrived too,
		      yet lotta kept feeling more distant - i had been sort
		      of upset by the fact that demi faced the irony of 
		      life imitates art by being - what most sensible folks 
		      term - robbed of her rightful place in a sense by a
		      younger type woman...still, the fact that the slanderer
		      didn't win thrilled me, filled me with hope...as did
		      my research into the jackson flying v - yes i keep looking
		      at other guitars to buy - but only out of a mood that
		      is inclined to not get sucked into social media scrolling
		      or go topsy turvy browsing through porn in those times
		      wherein it mistakenly feels as if i have nothing to do -
		      or playing the chess app loses its charm - but that
		      guitar felt, despite the fact that i have yet to plug it
		      into the amp, like nothing i have experienced, like a
		      revelation, like new pathways were suddenly opened, yeah
		      i liked it but after really getting a sense of it i love
		      it...even if i were willing to spend the money on a 
		      gibson, i would still take the jackson because of the
		      frets...the katana or whatever its called ends at 22...
		      the sensation i got with the jackson was that i had
		      two sets of frets. oh and the strings that came with
		      it feel exceptional which itself hints at how the
		      choice of wound might make further magic...i started
		      calling her shirley and wrapped her in my robe until
		      the case arrives...i have set up the amp to play but
		      have not found a nice enough moment to turn it on -
		      i continue my ritual on the ibanez which i never named
		      but i suppose by logic it would be nicole - not making
		      much progress on the sweeping but some improvement
		      yet it struck me that the source of inspiration for
		      the exploration, meaning jerry garcia, did not play
		      in that style...not even tapping either, to think of
		      it...so i ask myself is insisting on expanding into
		      that area contrary to my goal...my instinct tells me
		      it is even if the idea is to learn not emulate or
		      imitate...i sort of enjoy doing it even if i do not
		      have the so called practice habit...and i worry that
		      it might not be instinct but merely being lazy...
		      also do i need to impress myself in that way? 
		      dream of man in gold mask alike eyes wide shut pointing
		      awaking nearly in palpitations...
		      i was not, turning to other thoughts, not impressed
		      by the reaction in the media to the meeting held
		      in the white house recently, the actor puppet who
		      made the z war what it is really sat there and
		      threatened the united states, oh you don't feel it
		      now but you will...then people were being critical
		      of the president for standing up to this bloodthirsty
		      clown...shocking. i hope there is a another confrontation
		      with the one question, where did all the money go?
		      i watched dead money, it was a trip and i was especially
		      happy that the actress was not treated like an object...
		      i also didn;t object to hagen and in fact started thinking
		      hey i actually know what most of the words mean...with
		      some effort i could easily be fluent in german...of course
		      like the italian, my knowledge felt fading upon hearing
		      faster talk...location is everything might be the only
		      truth - living near folks that spoke beyond one's learnt
		      language would obviously turn the tide in a sense...but
		      that is an argument for schools i suppose - i did suspect
		      vicious was going to be too much for me so i skipped through
		      it even if one of the actors amazed me by a sort of alchemy
		      i have only ever felt with zelda adams...romy gevers...
		      all at once emilee and lotta clearly envisioned at her
		      countenance here and there...before that strange sunday
		      love removal machine yelling, i had dreamt i was on a
		      double date - me and emilee with another couple - it
		      looked to be a plain room and all four us were about
		      to have sex - i remember feeling her right tit and
		      finding it unusual - as if sloped...looking over at
		      the other couple i asked her to wait, i didn't feel
		      right, like it was sleazy somehow...no idea who or 
		      why - maybe someone trying to go back into the
		      recent past...perhaps my own nostalgia, in any case
		      she was very cool and did not insist on fucking - 
		      so we walked a bit quietly and i got up...got up
		      feeling it had indeed been no dream at all - a
		      printed memory...weird. weirder still is the
		      strange sensation as the week continues that in 
		      thinking of lotta i am confronted and confused by
		      other women...i don't know the reason or how this
		      might be resolved...on the surface everything seems
		      the same and she is going to paris on friday...yet
		      the feeling is now foreign...dream unusual scene,
		      i get up from bed to pee, flush the toilet and it
		      goes backwards overflowing then flooding the floor -
		      there is a girl here or wherever that might have
		      been - distinctly two rooms - one with an air conditioner
		      neither of them anything to go on about, plain...there
		      are perfumes on one mattress, i pick one up trying
		      to read the label but i am also pretending to be nice
		      to perhaps get laid...but suddenly as if reflecting
		      what has been disturbing my thoughts lately, my sister
		      is there and thus the dream has no resolution - another
		      scene another woman is fixing sculptures, well carvings,
		      wooden - in the dream i think of laura sophia's ladder -
		      yet there is no clarity - meaningless, helpless, i have
		      no clue as if staring at an out of focus abstract work
		      of art - it could be this or that...not like lara,
		      recognized and accounted for yet that scene told no story
		      except seeing her...a cosmic sort of cosima - i heard
		      some story about a private mission to the moon...i was
		      re-reading we have always lived in the castle for the
		      sake of my new guitar, the jackson not the kramer - and
		      in the early part the narrator speaks of freeing her
		      mind by setting up shop on the moon...oh wait there
		      was a horrific lady in the plain room scene, she was
		      touching my face and chest and i was pleading with the
		      other girl to get her away from me - i can still sense
		      the greed in that touch...imagine to want so badly
		      to be caressed and instead encounter such a scene - 
		      i've made a note of EWS yet presently i cannot recall
		      what i meant to shorthand...sometimes one hears something
		      that drowns out logic...the implication that a big time
		      university, which i know owns plenty of real estate, has 
		      no dorms  - sends a storm into the mind...of course i
		      myself too often speak or even write without weighing
		      everything but i don't want to go into a rant as this
		      feels like it also pulls at one of my screenplays and
		      that is obviously another story in itself - the alessi
		      jug fell out of the fridge and later as i thought about my
		      grandfather, it happened to be the anniversary of his death,
		      i wondered...now, i connect it clearly to carrying that
		      silver tray crowded with drinks for sister and her brood
		      years ago here then feeling as if grandmother had yanked
		      my arm not wanting it used to serve someone in that tribe -
		      tribute to spirituality, i guess one thing that bothers
		      me is folks that refuse to admit the fact of spirits. 
		      i'm trying to not jump to conclusions, but i sense
		      the recent mix ups portend to an end point...i nearly
		      weep at having this confusion over lotta...yet i can
		      only wait to see what will be...que sera, quo vadis...
		      quicksand party i am sinking in the middle of what
		      looks to be models...confident women all of them paired
		      up...i have a memory of jan, my quip in the elevator 
		      about garlic pizza, it keeps away vampires, to which
		      she said, and everyone else...so the setting was like
		      that space but not exactly...i stand then sit next
		      to a dark haired girl and she is very inviting, i 
		      notice then they are all pressing their genitals
		      close together - imagine a sitting position but
		      with their backs to the floor - jelly fish and 
		      exotic aquatic things, seahorses, swim and float
		      to and fro the vulvas the labias the vaginas and
		      in some cases the anus - i have not moved yet it
		      is also as if i'm floating - hovering over all
		      of them - then further invitation to join in
		      the sex aquarium i guess you'd call it to which
		      i said something about lotta and being shy and
		      having to go all at once as if words brought me
		      through descending elevator into waking reality - 
		      i had worked one night at the pink pussy cat
		      parlour down in the village when that was mel's
		      gig and a few years ago i dreams=t of him when
		      i was in 3k - the shower flowing and filled with
		      turtles and squids and the like that were speaking
		      and flapping around as if sending me a message i
		      could not and still don't understand - in the 
		      shower yesterday trying to rid myself of what
		      can only be described as whiplash - that visited
		      while scrolling through social media - i felt
		      something beside me, it was one of the curtains
		      that had slipped out of place...i sensed lotta
		      yet in some sort of well slow motion blinking -
		      she was actually catching up with a friend - later
		      posting photos that had the photographer's reflection
		      in the frame - marlene talked to me about fame,
		      i thought of the hiatt song...i thought of my
		      own songs briefly as the notification came in
		      of their 'release' - obviously, these had been
		      out before and i was truly more concerned with
		      lotta except for of course hoping for their success
		      not that i ever felt them as failures no but more
		      so that warner brothers would meet regret and
		      want to sign up two skinny girls so we could say
		      no, man, we want to be a columbia recording artist,
		      well sony...well so long for now it's the day they
		      opened Tutankhamen's burial site in 1924...a century
		      ago...they asked if i prefer my time travel going
		      back or forth, without heistation i responded thataway.
		      there is no future without the past, the previous 
		      sequence of events...in fact i honestly believe there
		      has mostly been only repetition since world war two. 
		      ps, i ordered communion wafers for mom and have
		      a devilish excitement to meet her reaction. 
		       
		       
		      twelve march
		       
                      i actually have too much within my mind...listing the
		      films i watched and skipped the last week and the
		      book i glanced at before the typing started...
		      so yeah the wafers arrived as did lotta in paris, 
		      i remember it was the self same day i tried all
		      the variations on the jackson plugged in...dear me
		      i can actually tap on this axe like some sort of 
		      piano...so that was a freak out minute in a nice
		      way as was feeling her presence for a few minutes
		      about the same time yet as i put place the six strings
		      away i sensed i was looking back at myself somehow,
		      like the instance with the guitar has somehow filmed
		      and playing in my mind's eye...time then slowed and
		      i surrendered to a strange wait...for ms stichler
		      which only felt ironic having made it a point to 
		      be awake early for her only to wind up lost in 
		      confusion...in feeling myself near to judgement
		      and or blame - although a natural reaction - i
		      started to feel concern for that instinct since i 
		      had no idea what she might be going through...
		      when i went to paris a woman told me i couldn;t 
		      smoke outside charlie degaulle and i joined a 
		      crowd that was all smoking next to a no smoking
		      sign...is the whole thing going backwards, arethey
		      playing our song...what was it you wanted, what was
		      it i wanted...in a not so simple twist of fate i
		      quoted a verse from arthur mcbride as a sort of 
		      farewell sensing that her idea of forever meant
		      only a few months...but here i am on the bordeline
		      of passing down sentence...the fact is i am not 
		      sure what went down and can only say that my feeling
		      was pretty foreign or far away from the sensation of
		      her...in starting to query my own emotions i further
		      deleted instagram and telegram...which i know will
		      sound extreme to some yet didn't and doesn't sound
		      foolish to me exept it underlines that lonesome
		      feeling as if there were less people in the world - 
		      anyway for all i know she might have come to dislike
		      my affection/attention and so i redecorated the 
		      domain sections that had her featured...upon her
		      return the only unusual thing she posted was a 
		      bottle of wine with a fish on the label...i suppose
		      your guess is as good as mine...dreams didn't help,
		      i only recall a handful from the past week; a bone
		      jutted out from atop my right thigh and was nearly
		      reaching the table, someone was in front of me and
		      i was trying to play it cool while wondering what
		      to do then awoke. in another scene, i was in the
		      back seat of a car, a man in the front seat turned
		      around and said something but i haven;t a clue about
		      the words since he looked like someone out of 1960s
		      history book...bizarre...then last night i dreamt 
		      about soraya who i have not had contact with in 
		      long while...in any case it wasn't all sorrow
		      as i went out once and hit up wendys which served
		      me the greasiest breakfast fries i have ever guessed
		      upon with salt - flies, literal flies, were hanging
		      out on the back row dining tables...i was making 
		      my way back from getting a phone book and smokes
		      and trying to get a taxi back, since being hounded
		      by law enforcement in the past, i don't carry a 
		      cell phone with me when i go out - i turned into
		      a lighting and lamp shop and made my pleading speech
		      for their help with as much humor and patience as i
		      could manage, one of the girls walked away and i followed
		      feeling she was on her way to call a cab, maite, maite,
		      was terribly nice. it's an app she explained using the
		      full word - application...she even walked me to the door
		      and waited to find the car she had contacted, i was so 
		      moved i touched her right arm as if in love...later i felt
		      that had been too over the top...although sometimes it is 
		      exactly what a person needs, a wordless thank you in the 
		      form of a caress - i felt that way sitting in a library
		      once upon a time - librarian touched my arm so gently
		      it felt like a an embrace...i'm in no race but i have
		      improved the living space some - oh yeah and the flying
		      v got a redesign which turned out divine although at the
		      time all i could think of was lotta or what had occured
		      that now felt beyond any cure...i even started to mistrust
		      my imagination - well, we will i suppose see what happens -
		      today she did mention something in passing about a friendship
		      breakup yet it is hard to know what she meant, what she means -
		      i only know that i don't want to chance further stabbings in
		      the dark as it were...my imagination is equally too tame
		      and to wild upon certain turns and even shuts down at the 
		      heart's weeping...where was i, ah the guitar decore -
		      looking at the cover, i took a listen to 
		      we have always lived in the castle reading by kalin hollingshead
		      who does a stop and even restate while presenting...a couple
		      of chapters in i decded to turn to the film...the one
		      with taissa and alexandra in it...now i have read the book
		      and seen that movie before but it was clear that once was not
		      enough -  i suppose that is the case with anything worth
		      the while - in yet another failed attempt to see adolescence
		      i turned to the prizefighter and the lady wherein i was
		      awed by the song and dance number - there was no awe in
		      lumina, although i always enjoy seeing eric roberts - 
		      earlier i was getting into 'the awful truth' yet due
		      to technical difficulties i wound up watching a very
		      weird screwball skit named 'that uncertain feeling'
                     which looked to be the origin of more than several 
		      subsequent films and songs - the weird surprise
		      was 'the capture' circa 1950...well if westerns
		      aren;t out of your way...far away in my own new
		      script inky is put placed in charge of shaping up
		      the catholic church, he commences by castrating
		      all the male clergy, some insist on keeping their
		      cut off parts in a preservative container within
		      the lining of their wardrobe but mostly they are
		      thrown out in the unused backyard that is adjacent
		      to the makeshift clinical lab were the cocks meet
		      the knife...as time passes a tree grows there sprouting
		      dicks of all shapes and sizes, some call it obscene while
		      others claim it a miracle...some of the priests even party
		      proclaiming the godly power of their magic markers - 
		      nuns are found fornicating and even tasting the tree...
		      inky is at a loss for what to do until finding a woman
		      with a gold tipped dildo in his spam messages, ordering
		      dozens of the devices he instructs the nuns that have
		      been brought down by temptation, they are categorized
		      as the eves, to secretly massage themselves as they see
		      fit...the pope gets wind of this part of the story and
		      suffers from shortness of breath which requires hospital
		      care, there is talk that inky will be let go even ex-communicated
		      yet he sends in an expert team from the nordic lands to give
		      the pontif a full body rub down while playing songs from
		      the argentina of his youth...the recovery is immediate
		      and meetings are held to iron out the kinks as it were - 
		      the film then replays in reverse until the credit rolls
		      as inky "starts" to work...well there then i wish i had
		      better news but i don't except that the kramer has cleared
		      customs and should be here any day now.
		       
		       
		      13 march 
		       
		      any day meant yesterday yet not only that...the kramer arrived
		      with the fender case i had ordered due to the price and it turns
		      out to be a perfect match for the ibanez...yet not only that
		      as then i was informed that the rest of this haul was nearly
		      all set to be sent out...if a month would countdown quickly
		      then i might also have the tele i settled for instead of my
		      desired next guitar along with the flying v case and the rest
		      of it...now when i say settle i do not mean i didn't want it too...
		      two tone knobs had me a bit confused, the whammy bar didn't
		      feel right, and the fret edges pecked away at my index and
		      thumb, but oh how i adore this mahogany body and maple neck
		      axe...it is a strat style like the roadstar, but i have 
		      owned a fender stratocaster and in some aspects this is 
		      actually better, it beats it by the way the neck feels
		      uhm even with the cutting sharpness which obviously could
		      be filed down easily...in weighing it i recalled why never
		      really wanted a gibson so much as they felt so heavy...although
		      i did like my very old les paul junior very much...still even
		      with that - which i then had a nice warm tube amp and chorus
		      pedal - there were was no sweetness in the tone...which this
		      somehow has...maybe i merely learned to play a bit more by
		      now as opposed to way back when...but i wasn't trying to 
		      play as it were i was tuning it up and checking the switches
		      as i sauntered through some bebop scales and chords...how
		      might i explain, it was like a backwards sigh at the surprise
		      of hearing what is that, resonance...vibratoish reverb...a
		      real emotional sound which i believe i have yet to exhale,
		      that sigh went in and was lost in the shock of oh wow even
		      through a shitty ancient high end of the low t-power amp
		      without any effects the kramer rings out a gentle force
		      that could rival any ringing...my only other note is that
		      my die hard cord somehow felt too tight in the jack socket
		      as i struggled to pull it out although it might have been
		      due to the angle of my pull as that didn;t happen the first time.
		      oh yeah the color, in this case the red one or ruby as they
		      call it, is a sort of pastel - neither bright nor loud - as if
		      subdued seemingly more pink than crimson...the real twist in 
		      the story is that if i wanted to i could switch out parts from
		      the roadstar since they are nearly identical yet i like it
		      so much that i even have second thoughts about replacing the
		      pickguard as i had planned...and yes i wouldn't want to ever
		      disturb my ibanez...my apologies for the guitar porn.
		      in any case i hope this note helps anyone on the fence over
		      an inexpensive kramer. the price is a lie, and there is a
		      lifetime guarantee to repair the thing for as long as the
		      purchaser owns the guitar. i need not say more on the subject
		      except i hope and wish to have another kramer down the line.
		      in dreams i felt easy, yet once again i wandered around
		      in some dark city landscape evening while carrying a woman
		      upon my back as one would a child or as a reader might imagine
		      one of my earlier dreams...i had the notion it was emilee yet
		      i also had the idea it was lotta...no eyes in the back of my
		      head...a car had turned over seemingly after too much speed -
		      i neared and a leaned in to see a woman upsidedown, hey
		      she started to say as if everything was entirely normal, how
		      about we go out and get some cocaine...the lyric to west
		      l.a. fadeaway and sue belle driving in palm beach crossed my mind...
		      i got up then thinking to type it up but i knew if i did
		      i might find myself awake too early thus taxing my cigarette
		      stash more than i wanted - i went back to sleep still in the
		      sensation of being content over the new guitar...the day
		      before i had dreamt of another woman put placing a piece
		      of meat into a frying skillet - it seemed to be seasoned
		      only with rosemary or oregano - i rattled out of the scene
		      as the first part of it started browning in the oil -
		      then tonight well this morning even if in los angeles it
		      is still only very late in the evening, i had casual scenes
		      that once again wove in and out of memory's view as if merely
		      sliding by as if to say nothing to see here or everything
		      will be allright somehow...i thought of india maybe more than
		      i wanted and then wroted these words.  i want to party with
		      a pizza but i can't order one for five hours or so...six in
		      the eastern standard time zone...i imagine lotta is having
		      lunch by now...hopefully none of my doubts or weirdness
		      have been an imposition on her...or others. 
		       
		       
		      14 march
		       
		      in a picnic table dream two sisters sit across each other.
		      they have matching haircuts. very short blonde bobs.
		      one of them is next to me. on my left side. 
		      she is speaking about her haircut. it was yesterday.
		      that is about all i hear. a plate of food is passed.
		      the picnicesque table extends past my view, i can only
		      see a dark haired woman sitting on my right side...
		      as the plate is put placed near me a man approaches
		      the sister on the other side. he is giving her a
		      cooked baby carrot. no, a cooked baby corn like
		      the ones mei sauteed in szechuan style restaurant
		      second floor broadway before gambling the place away.
		      i watch her open her mouth and swallow the thing then
		      awake. 
		      the day had not been eventful, i ate some of the pizza
		      thinking of julia mecey, i started to watch the devil's
		      backbone, but i was still too distracted by the new
		      guitar which i eased some with a nail file which did 
		      the job but then i had a bit of fret buzz on the low
		      e string which resolved itself by getting the axe in
		      tuning...i then removed the strings of the martin acoustic
		      with the intent to upend the glued bridge job i had
		      performed years ago when i didn't know i had to clamp it
		      down while letting it dry. my job was too well done and
		      i couldnt find a way to undo it with desire and knife - 
		      put placing the large kramer sticker where the pickguard
		      came off some weeks ago i tried not to worry about
		      being stuck with such high action on the neck, i might
		      have even thanked it for giving my scale ritual extra strength,
		      i have extra strings but put the same ones back - i entertained
		      the flying v with all the pentatonic scales thinking how
		      it is really the one to use for any type of lead guitar work -
		      it was the first day in a long while that i did not play
		      the ibanez...later i couldnt resist another round with the
		      kramer and it was then i noticed that the unplugged sound
		      vibrates nearly equally from the back in a sort of stereo
		      effect wherein i could hear a bit of the tone that i enjoyed
		      so much when it was amplified...in other words another surprise
		      perk to the magic i did not ever expect...i went to sleep
		      early lamenting having to plan to go out for cigarettes
		      given that the shop i order from was yet again out of stock -
		      after what i am calling the picnic dream i dreamt of 
		      an asian woman's picture...she was holding a guitar but
		      the photograph had another side and in that other picture
		      she was in a squat, legs partly spread - her genitals
		      visible below a nearly wicked grin...i got up then and
		      jotted this down.

		      post-script, i keep looking over at my new guitar and 
		      wonder how long this excellent feeling with last...yet
		      the reason for adding to this entry follows, an experience
		      i have not encountered before and found baffling;
		      i was thinking of gene and how the last news of him
		      -before the sad story of his passing -
		      had to do with a pie...apple pie? well, whatever but
		      it was about the time that tampere was released...
		      i adjusted the cover and pulled out the record, 
		      needing to make the level-sent wav into an mp3
		      or flac file...i tried three or four places with 
		      each informing me that the converted file could not
		      be downloaded in lacking a scan of some sort...
		      this being an 'opera' browser - i switched to another
		      browser and got an mp3 version, then it would only
		      upload eighty percent, i converted again and the flac
		      went through however the serial number came out as 
		      already in use, maybe that one is still in some stores?
		      how would i know...frustrated and with a sense of desperation
		      i finally put it through obviously having to wait to hear
		      when it will be re-released...all of it feels to strange
		      to even say like a tongue twister - packed peter pickles
		      piper pecked checked and rechecked - by the way laudanum
		      is still yes still in that limbo wait...my apologies if
		      anyone was expecting it before this or whenever it gets
		      back to its place...for the more curious, tampere is 
		      a city in finland...i locked all that i could lock and
		      put placed an extra padlock on the front gate leaving
		      to search for the cigarettes and gather up the milk and
		      eggs i also had planned to get...that at least was a 
		      success and even grabbed some camphor on the way - 
		      i was told that there was a credit amount at barnes
		      and not so noble and responded that if that was the
		      case i wanted a specific shirley jackson collection - 
		      i felt her or perhaps e. moss while making my exit...
		      in the magical world these things happen, i was not
		      taken aback. i proceeded to play the entire scale
		      ritual on the new kramer...i picked up a film called
		      borderline which put the madonna echo in my head...
		      i don't know how i know so many songs and also don't
		      know so many songs in some sort of inner contradiction -
		      oh well at least now i see how oh babe it ain't no lie
		      when the dead were jamming and jerry as if possessed
		      put placed some antique ballad into the air and bob
		      questioned, i think it was bob, so that that simply
		      came to your mind out of nowhere and he was like yeah -
		      not as impressive as hearing moonlight play in my
		      head upon listening to grace's new song idea...
		      no gatekeeping, i did tell her...had to look up the
		      title which felt weird because i learnt that entire
		      record at the same time i got into open tunings
		      for blood on the track covers...i suppose it's like
		      burroughs' dream machine .. some sort of revolving
		      mechanism that spins itself invisible yet lets out
		      a light every so often...not that i can claim to recall
		      all those chords but seeing i am way past being
		      concise and to the point let me conclude with the
		      title of new screenplay well synopsis..."THE NIFTY
		      END FIRST" 
                       
		       
		      ides of march
		       
		     ( prelude note, when i mention the film replaying
		      in reverse), i mean exactly that except with variations
		      in shots and soundtrack...possibly lighting too. i 
		      explained my notion idea to mother telling her that
		      the nudity and sex would be done in a way that voids
		      exploitation as well as not exceeding the story itself,
		      all the good or great films with naked scenes are like
		      that, one remembers the narrative not the exposure -
		      i have second thoughts in terms of it not having an
		      action sequence yet i don't have much more than some
		      younger priest trying to duck the decree, getting on
		      mopeds and being chased by vatican guards in of course
		      vans through the curving byways of rome...
		      (pretending i didn;t see that note), when i hit the 
		      play button on borderline i couldn't help continually
		      hitting the skip ahead button until finally it came
		      to its end. it looked promising even synchronistic
		      in starting at the end like i was thinking for my
		      spec, but it was a red herring, once the 'action'
		      started it was neither entertaining, informative,
		      or funny...i don't know why they made this like that
		      and wished i had missed it...now the devil's backbone
		      felt like genius even if pulp in contrast...
		      the title on the opening is the deserter i think,
		      maybe i should have deserted that movie before having
		      to write about how much i disliked it...
		      (positively new dream note), i'd gone to sleep late -
		      yet awoke a few hours later to the sound of a feral
		      cat howling, i struggled to decide if i should leave
		      the bed and did so thinking of skirt - the cat inside.
		      the cat outside kept howling as if possessed...i had
		      wanted to quote dylan to anne marie, the cops don't
		      need you and man they expect the same, but it was
		      the first time she ever responded and who knows maybe
		      she was right - maybe it is safe in miami at three 
		      forty seven in the morning - about that self mentioned
		      time eastern standard i tried to go back to sleep but
		      could not...thinking of her and grace, and india, and
		      rachel with her paypal story, and what alexandra is
		      going to do with her pets when she goes to italy and
		      even if ashley was sending me a secret message yes 
		      even if lotta was implying that she'd been here and
		      knew all about me through a sandwich and chips...
		      what i really wanted most of all was to play my new
		      guitar, the kramer even if the jackson was the one
		      i should concentrate on given how it could improve
		      my playing...i got up again restless and smoked a
		      cigarette instead and by that time i was reeling
		      with the knowledge that my love for lotta was a lot
		      more than i could explain...the sensation surrounded 
		      me, i am tempted to say embraced me but more likely
		      seduced me...well re-seduced me, reducing me to lay
		      there as if intent on worship, well re-worship...
		      she was even in my dream, i suppose i was trying to
		      tell her something and she was trying to tell me 
		      something and in the crossfire of words i couldn't
		      hear what she said while standing next to her by some
		      wall sized windows that looked out onto other buildings,
		      a school i saw later - there was a french school across
		      the street in something burroughs wroted - bertolt brecht
		      says you are a flathead, maybe i was trying to explain how
		      or why i turned so crude with mother a couple of times
		      during a previous conversation -or how some phrases are
		      nearly impossible to translate - the western has a great
		      example, if you ask someone if they ate tongues when they
		      go on and on well it sounds strange in english yet in 
		      castellano it makes sense and is even entertaining for 
		      reasons beyond my comprehension...as i turned in the
		      dream possibly still surprised that the whole emilee
		      comp het came to mind in the whirlwind of earlier thoughts,
		      compulsory heterosexuality, i could not tell if it was 
		      because of her or because lotta's middle name is emilie...
		      in the dream there is a dresser containing drawers where
		      i have hidden away some valued possessions - i cross the
		      loft for it must have been a loft to have such windows -
		      yet upon gazing through the contents i find some of the goods
		      have been stolen - suddenly i turn my glance to the entrance
		      and see a horrid looking man punching himself in the head
		      and dropping to the floor as if a self-inflicted knock out -
		      another man, not so horrid in appearance and smartly attired
		      starts a speech on how he made that happen and how he found
		      and forced himself onto my stash - i am trying to figure out
		      who these people are and how it all might relate to me yet
		      in shake head motion i stand entirely uncertain as to how
		      to proceed then in a rightward glance i notice horses,
		      soldiers upon the horses, all of them bright and glowing,
		      there are other soldiers with rifles - there is a command
		      to shoot from behind them and they do so - meanwhile i 
		      start thinking i should get back to the window and without
		      much care for the artillery i make way through- waiting as
		      they press gunpowder into nozzles to continue firing...like
		      being in two worlds - i don't look back, standing at the window
		      alone now i can hear the conversation as the children make
		      their way out and the teacher talks to one little girl about
		      needing to care for her skin as it looked to be too dry -
		      you sure do have dry skin, she said...i had said as much to myself
		      upon feeling my legs in the earlier portion of the late evening.
		      i type this up after gathring my thoughts...i remember being
		      on the upper east side, i had noticed an extra dry spot on the
		      outer side of the top of my left calf before going out, as 
		      i walked a little girl, hmm younger than the one in the dream -
		      say that one was nine or ten while this was one was four or five -
		      scratched the self-same spot pausing a second to do so until the
		      woman holding her hand was pulling instead of being in rhythm -
		      those very early students at the sacred heart school wear a sort
		      of italian restaurant table cloth uniform...it is only later that
		      they get the actual school uniform. here's to the frog leap 
		      sophomore that made a very cute impression as i went by and she
		      was entering the institution with her classmate friend back in 
		      head lice city.
		      (post-script note), the late great american film - writer - director
		      - and actor - saunters in as a general to reinstate the deserter
		      making the devil's backbone a real treat for me...i'm not saying
		      it's worth your while to view, i'm only saying i liked it and
		      the fact that he is in it made it rise a bit above pulp b-movie
		      spahgetti western. 
		       
		       
		      16 march
		       
		      imaginary drugs felt like they were kicking it in the early
		      afternoon - i was drowsy and didn't even feel much like playing.
		      for a minute i missed having only a couple of guitars since
		      now i always sense the longing to not neglect this one or that...
		      the six strings have been drinking, not me...deadly tornado in
		      the southern states yet i wasn;t looking at the news much yesterday
		      and caught up on the events a few minutes ago...seems awful...
		      kicking were they like felt drugs...imaginary hmm, the pants are
		      if it us true in the mind then it ain't no lie on some level...
		      level, i can hardly stand to use or see that word no more...
		      well, maybe with the exception of tore down, the blues number
		      that is...i didn't get to skin care, opting instead to indugle
		      my drowsiness...who knows, perhaps or maybe i should have waited
		      a bit more...i wasn't myself at the turning of the tide that
		      trips into sleep...something pulling in opposite directions - 
		      i settled into dream position as a dog was yelp barking loud
		      and intensely for more minutes than i cared to count as if in
		      response to the previous day's cat howl...the german shepard
		      in the movie doesn't make it being overtaken by the 'savages'...
		      i haven't felt a good stretch of sleep in a while, last night
		      was no different...i recall a dream wherein a man - heavy and
		      strange to me - sauntered near to the bookshelf i put placed
		      in the hall...there had been several unusal noises before i 
		      dozed off and certain sounds still make nervous - in this case
		      it was more about jihoon who mentioned falling asleep with 
		      her door open and awaking to someone looking in to see if
		      she was all right...so in my superstition, i entertained panic
		      and that possibly resulted in that scene - the man seemed curious
		      about burroughs and i was at a loss for words mainly trying to 
		      get him away from myself and my books - i had the feeling that
		      it was a cousin but i have so many cousins i couldnt tell...
		      i awoke feeling neither rested nor inspired...i stumbled into
		      the internet to see havana was still in the dark - i thought
		      about how i should not make such a scene about tidying up
		      the house and simply get to it - but i still had no plan or
		      intent in that area - coffee, cigarettes, suddenly enchanted
		      by a jackson west song that names some famous outlaw, i weighed
		      how wonderful it would be to hear marcus king cover that one -
		      in a southern blues rock fashion...he has his own new song too
		      yet for me it slips and slides too much between the eagles
		      desperado and the allman brothers midnight rambler, not musically
		      but merely from the lyric...the lyric is what i pay attention to
		      mainly...obviously not the case when it's instrumental...in other
		      words wishing these people well...someone was asking people to 
		      name artists that had back to back perfect albums...i thought
		      and still think the pretenders II and Learning To Crawl fit
		      that defintion where even 'Get Close' nearly made it three in 
		      a row...it's sunday and i don't know exactly what to do - 
		      it might be that having had only two left over slices of pizza
		      yesterday and a few chessman cookies wer not enough of a diet
		      to balance myself...damn john barrymore memories made me feel
		      full or at least satisfied...'You shall hear nothing, you shall see nothing, 
		      you shall think nothing, you shall be nothing but Svengali, Svengali, Svengali...,
		       
		       
		      17 march 
		       
		      chinese take out. william wyler's the big country...i was viewing
		      it for gregory peck but it was thrilling to also find charlton heston -
		      yet weird to have a song lyric ring out while watching it - what
		      happens tomorrow is on your head not mine...in any case it was kind 
		      of like reading a novel as it lingered without hurry from one scene
		      to the next...cinema houses were made for epics like this one - 
		      now haunted by the sunset boulevard line, i am big - it's the 
		      pictures that got small! i played all my electric guitars to 
		      not have jealousy in the ranks...i dreamt naked girls in my
		      bed that i did not see...i suppose i was still rattled by
		      the stray noises that chimed while i was trying to think of 
		      lotta and reach the dream lands...one of them looked so 
		      beautiful she could have been a goddess...i slid atop her
		      stopping for a second to look as i crossed onto what must
		      have been another going to sleep scene in silence - i can 
		      only explain it by stating that i dreamt i was dreaming 
		      easy and awoke with only that in mind...well i also had it
		      in mind to go for a used blackstar id core that was cheap 
		      until i saw the delivery and tax added up to might as well
		      get the boss katana...all this came about upon a missing
		      ag spalding pen that had been shipped from italy...from
		      an aforementioned haul...i was also sexually excited yet
		      i couldn;t concentrate...so i played scales on the ibanez
		      thinking how friendly it felt, how i could even be more 
		      aggessive without worrying over snapping a string - i even
		      looked over the prometheus scale with intent to memorize it
		      even as i planned to cut the scale ritual as follows;
		      all the bebop scales on the kramer, all the pentatonic
		      and voodoo scales on the jackson, and selected others
		      on the ibanez...that is, after i settle all scores with
		      what i have gathered in terms of that over the last two
		      years of dedication to them...the last ones i learned,
		      i find, are not wholly held in the mind...much like the
		      issue i had with enigmatic and arabic until i termed
		      the later one byzantine...but yeah, seeing that film was
		      like oh i'm james mckay getting knocked about by old thunder
		      only to satisfy myself...if i keep the count low, i believe
		      i will feel more freedom for other aspects of the instruments.
		      it's only an idea but i am leaning in that direction...
		      i was leaning into oh wow anne marie followed me but then
		      the notification tuned away from itself...still, for a minute
		      i could not contain my grin...left over chinese then with
		      red onion as i thought about julia mecey's vest - uhm i should
		      have said that theory, in terms of the ritual, came about while
		      fiddling and finding i could actually recall a rhythm and
		      riff i had learned by ear way back when and realized the
		      scales will be there long after even if i leave some for
		      now...the rhythmic chords and riff well they hardly met
		      such continual greetings...so there was the catalyst, that
		      and going over the specs of the flying v - purplewood it
		      said...i said purplewood? the shirley jackson book cover
		      sticker is none other than purple...there was a groove 
		      in the air, not notes but a sensation that i was on the 
		      right track...hopefully it will work out...after ordering
		      the amp i went into india's kite, a minute later she was 
		      asking for no less than amp...yes i know, yet as a writer
		      i can't help but note it since it sort of proves the 
		      groove had carried itself over from sunday into present
		      time monday...lotta said she was editing a video and
		      i felt an expectation in that knowledge which made the
		      day feel a fine sense of hope...i need to plan a snack
		      and put away the guitars which are now overwhelming the
		      sofa...
		   ps, i should have mentioned my panic at the sounds were
		      made to pull more as i pushed through the knowledge
		      that the nozzle of a spray upon the bookshelf in
		      question - there awaiting to be put away along with
		      other items - was found on the floor...yes, skirt
		      might have jumped up on there yet he hasn't been
		      prone to naps or sleep upon that space lately...
		      earlier i had a double take glance moment as if
		      an aura was still hovering in front of that wood.
		      ps ii, lotta's video featured hallon soda - the 
		      word translates as raspberry...there are also
		      nicotine pouches named like that...it was her
		      third english video and she was not feeling well -
		      i wished for her recovery and proceeded to visit
		      my guitars again, the new ones...
		      ps iii, i had heard the song 'get together', very
		      hippie sixties thing alike 'love the one you're 
		      with'...i would have said it was csn&y...but it's
		      the youngbloods...the obituary named jesse colin
		      young...i suppose it's fair to say a one hit 
		      wonder but i am not certain that was a hit song -
		      real name perry miller...
		      ps, iv, playing along with 'alabama getaway' which
		      i thought was in A, through a minor scale in E -
		      stil sort of worked yet i had the weirdest pressure
		      like someone trying to look through one of my eyes...
		      later in reflection it did not feel like it usually
		      had it the past - hmm yes the fan at full speed was
		      louder than the cell phone volume...the axe was also
		      not plugged in...a long strange trip indeed...still,
		      an unusal chord progession arrived while looking up
		      the variations of E6add9...i'm not implying that
		      chord is from that tune. 
		      ps, v, on a whim i made the email for this domain
		      dream@wordstar.nexus - given the possibity of spam
		      i am not going to glue the hmu yet if you have 
		      a dream to share please send it along...
		       
		       
		      18 march  
		       
		      i myself had no specific dreams, yet i slept all right
		      you could say or easy...easing into the day feeling 
		      lighter somehow...in searching through guitars and
		      lately guitar magazines...i felt pretty weird over
		      a mentioned 'deal' - going to the link, it was
		      for something called fender play, which i guess is
		      why they have put placed all these 'online lessons'
		      on so many of their products, it seems one would
		      sign up for that and gain a guitar along with whatever
		      it is the fp is about...what i found strange is that
		      the guitar is not any fender, not even a squire...no,
		      it is a 'nashville works' thing in the stratocaster shape.
		      it feels contrary to logic...i took out the trash, 
		      maybe that is what they are doing...i chopped up
		      a potato and scrambled eggs, excited that lotta was
		      trying on dresses she had no time to wear, yet not
		      finding much to like in seeing the rest of kite...
		      the flaw in the film is that the protagonist is not
		      a superhero so all the 'heroics' are balanced on 
		      luck and the action turns favoring the her-o...
		      i was of course viewing for india and for the fact
		      that the trailer looked promising, but i have no
		      words of praise...i thought about cutting my nails
		      and i was craving the sequel to horizon ; an american
		      saga chapter - 1...
		      well, at least i found how or why the notes i tried
		      with that song matched even if outside the key...
		      i returned to it, the kramer now felt new again as 
		      if i was only just meeting its maple neck after
		      floating through all the pentatonic scales wherein
		      i kept wanting to continue with others against my
		      possible plan to cut back on them...i could hear
		      the fit match in A yet there was still something 
		      with the E notes that made me feel good in an outlaw
		      sort of a way...possibly it's trying new methods
		      that makes me feel as if i am starting to learn
		      the six string instead of expanding on what i 
		      already know...yes overthinking it is not fun
		      yet i believe a certain amount of introspection
		      is not bad...not bad at all, canto lxxxi comes
		      to mind, “Master thyself, then others shall thee beare”...
		       
		       
		      19 march 
		       
		      it was way past my bed time, a bad time, as bad as me...
		      a glitch in the diet - or the bed was suddenly hungry...
		      who knows, not i, eyed dreams blinded by the light...
		      the unbearable lightness of being...hair dressers,
		      chrissie hynde, clean up jobs, donka shoen i'm 
		      listing to now, i'll stand by you...in the dream
		      i seem to be in the second balcony, so dark it could
		      have been the forest - lightless - the plant maybe
		      the tree came extremely near, like an embrace - 
		      spirits in the night - spirits in the material 
		      whirl - i went to sleep waiting and i awoke with 
		      only that in mind still waiting...i mean for the 
		      right moment, that minute where everything makes
		      sense...the cents of scents...(they call me the 
		      breeze ain't no change in the weather ain't no
		      changes in me )- hounding news honduras made me
		      worry over the acoustic - fake news hospital drones
		      from the anti-putin press - laudanum finally released -
		      lotta didn't give up on soft drinks...i put placed
		      a pepsi in the fridge waiting for a supermarket
		      delivery that had long been left on the stairs -
		      staring at the phone once twice to be told - sold
		      out my lunch at least the india eisley film felt
		      easier - at least to the secret agent in me - 
		      i'm not sure what the title is, she plays tilly...
		      i spent the rest hours playing guitar - real love
		      was an idea yet i went with all of me in gminor
		      not to play or sing it but to vamp on it...still
		      the pull to piece together all the notes of the
		      scales pushed me into them as i thought oh yeas i
		      should also continue with this one or that in the
		      ritual...i'm all lost in the supermarket i can no
		      longer shop happily - i lifted two windows to let in
		      some of the breeze i felt breathing but several men
		      surrounded a so called tundra car parking it directcly
		      below the opening making for suspicion - i added a
		      pink guitar to my wishing list - listen to the slide
		      rattle on the returned whammy bar upon the kramer -
		      as some lower back discomfort eased some spider or
		      mosquito bit me near where jihoon's heart shaped
		      italian tattoo lives - six dead forty missing - 
		      i doubt they are even using coffins at this point
		      down in lampedusa...desolate penne around abruzza
		      details real estate deals...i could buy seventy
		      houses at that price...presently i'd rather buy
		      guitars...i can't understand how i was content
		      before this axe frenzy...i made the right choice
		      as all of me gave me a full three chord banger
		      i would not have found otherwise...elsewhere
		      mother employed the word hippopatamus and i 
		      was truly like what the ever living hell is
		      this wednesday...hungry hungry hippo - girl
		      from volgograd at asian zoo - alexandra said
		      she was pure evil as a brunette - i am the man
		      thomas, look at fogerty tappin' up on that
		      ibanez - now then it's hard to hear this wayne
		      without wanting to sing a long, goes a way into
		      explaining ferris beuller..." Oh, he's very popular 
		      Ed. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods,
		      wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. 
		      They think he's a righteous dude."...
		       
		       
		      21 march 
		       
		      correction, tillie not tilly...in any case- not bad 
		      but not good...my feeling is that the director or
		      producer put placed the burden of carrying the
		      film on her...it was hard to believe in some of
		      the other characters and well it was what it was
		      - a cut above mediocre b-movie...partly like the
		      writing, partly like high rollers, like hey it's
		      travolta so we can get away with bad writing - 
		      bad dreams no or perhaps, i can't tell - 
		      spirit of kafka i was surely studying a cord,
		      much like the one in my kitchen which doubles
		      for toaster oven and ready made clothes washer - 
		      vengeful cockroaches who knows - i got up feeling
		      i could have slept a few more hours with ease - 
		      can't exactly get used to wearing my new robe -
		      i made it a point to clean up and did so but i'm
		      still making myself wait to bathe or shower - maybe
		      i wanted to pen these words...i felt all right about
		      the decorations - i felt better about finally
		      finding a viewable copy of 'adolescence' - yesterday
		      - it reminded me a bit of rush, not the band, that
		      undercover drug drama that was pretty good...this
		      was possibly the one i've liked most next to the
		      look away scenes...still, the writing fails a 
		      couple of times and makes you think nobody speaks
		      like that, nobody would say that - well, maybe 
		      i was still feeling critical as it came only a
		      few hours after the other one ended...she was
		      excellent and it's a shame that the rest of it 
		      wasn't up to her performance...i remember thinking
		      to look up the list and see if i had included it
		      as it was partly or ironically about a writer - 
		      i also wanted to put place the artwork that
		      has been waiting now weeks...hmm the house was
		      too much a mess to not tidy it up - fighting 
		      my own inclination to let it be and later 
		      feeling giddy over another track's re-release,
		      i had some hard boiled eggs and added red onion
		      slices sprinkled with olive oil and lime to the
		      ordered mael, uhm meal...so a bit too drowsy
		      to hold my guitar yet still thinking about it
		      with desire which led to recheck the gibson 
		      app which i had previously installed without
		      it working - yesterday it was updated the 
		      store said and indeed that did the trick so
		      i also gave it a place on my other cell phone -
		      i listened to a lot of music and then here i
		      was hearing other tunes while typing...most likely
		      why i missed mentioning that in that she was alice -
		      "From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole I've been
		      told where I must go and who I must be. I've been shrunk,
		      stretched, scratched, and stuffed into a teapot. 
		      I've been accused of being Alice and of not being Alice
		      but this is my dream. I'll decide where it goes from here..."
		      i tell mother about lucid dreaming and astral projection
		      decoding meditation from prayer and knowing full well
		      my own impatience in the first area and lack of interest
		      in the second...there ain't no round trip guarantee if
		      you leave your body...i gave jackson west my thoughts
		      on some lyric partly worried that she might not see
		      the admiration i intended. the part of me from irish simply
		      cannot shut up, i imagine. 
		       
		       
		      23 march 
		       
		      i could not say what this saturday was about yet hopefully
		      it's over - maybe it was karla's birthday or perhaps that
		      is today...why does one remember certain dates and not others,
		      a minute ago, through the whirlwind of thought which struggled
		      in vain to find out what i had been dreaming about the last
		      couple of days, i thought of what burroughs had wroted, in 
		      this case a question; how long does it take a man to know
		      that he cannot want what he wants? it was on the heels of
		      saying to myself; it's not who you love that counts but
		      rather who loves you. i was loving the idea of odessa, 
		      some musical photo play, until it started stealing from
		      the joey king film princess and put placed everything into
		      a much too simplistic view, that is black and white where
		      only the protagonist's hero journey was given value...so
		      i found myself skipping through the thing after the under
		      the boardwalk allusion, until the dystopian torture reel
		      ended...given my disposition i didn't want to deliver
		      myself in that state of mind into i am the night, maybe
		      it was we are the night...a tnt series with india...
		      i hope to get to that soon...chris pine is in it to boot -
		      ninety nine red balloons go by, everyone's a captain kirk -
		      there's a woman on a ladder in my star trek dream - it's
		      a hallway, hopefully not the hallway of always, a narrow
		      space, another woman standing behind a man holding a
		      paint brush, the tyoe one imagines using for watercolors,
		      he starts brushing at her jeans' buttocks and i'm very
		      upset, and i'm trying to stop him but it's all a frenzy 
		      and i wake up feeling bewildered...i had at least finally
		      bathed or showered although somehow upon deciding to shave
		      i found myself making the exact move that led to a cut -
		      this time on the other side of the neck...hmm not exact,
		      the first was a jagged motion, this was like the blade 
		      caught some angle...there are mysteries beyond the mind -
		      in new screenplay notes, imagination tells me, there
		      is a cup with a living tongue at the bottom that attempts
		      to lick the lips of the drinker when it is used...it must
		      be an evil sect casting itself as the antagonist of inky
		      in the vatican reel...we drink blood from this cup and
		      we don't like catholics...thank you ladies and gentlemen,
		      the plot twist wroted itself...maybe the film is better
		      than i expected...kenny was speaking to john...i heard it
		      once then watched, i was in the middle of disagreeing with
		      mister five on the motley crew point - no, no, not in the
		      same category as who he mentioned...in fact basic pop for
		      me, i wouldn't call it classic rock or even metal...however,
		      having more than a fair amount of respect for the man, i
		      thought i should think about it more knowing full well that
		      i prolly won't - what hit me was hearing kenny say you don't
		      see anybody when you're happening...when i settled in to 
		      my ritual and new concepts on the guitar now plural guitars
		      i didn't feel any improvement although i knew it was there -
		      i wanted to paly play chrods, 'heard it in a love song'
		      worked well...i picked up that sliding into a chord from
		      pink floyd, but i seem to have given it an expanded definition.
		      it was after insect bites and insect in coffee cup as the aforementioned
		      mosquito hung around the room like madness itself...attacking my
		      ankles and making me feel desperate...a johnny winter, a skeeter,
		      my libido...smells like lotta is too much in the sun...so i worried
		      over her forehead but the pain in my neck weighed me down out of
		      nowhere and i knew it would be gone once i gave in to the idea
		      of going to sleep...sure enough what sleep, i get up again amazed
		      at how this sort of thing happens, like a folly, like a farce,
		      like a foolish blindness...it's a good thing i was gifted with
		      patience along with whatever talent remains. in my dreams there
		      are no dreams...yet i see myself, the way i think i look, except
		      i can't call this a dream. i heard the words julio is the trip
		      or maybe julio it's the trip...in another language i heard the
		      words there is nobody here...i had thought how annoying it must
		      have been to be in a band with freddie mercury, and i wake
		      up with queen song hounding me...bahumbug it was only a thought -
		      bro, why you mad...mister farenheit, i relate him now to inka -
		      i read somewhere she was out with livin la vida loca tatum, 
		      the strings on my martin are rusty - i refuse to switch out
		      any strings even the ones that came with the new guitars...
		      jemima was in alone in paris flirting with champange...it does
		      not feel as if it is sunday...somehow in my inner clock it is
		      still friday...i don't like whatever drug this might be, the 
		      last thing i really remember was amanda saying jennifer's 
		      body was perfect and feeling as if my thoughts were yelling
		      themselves in the fashion of street fruit vendors...you 
		      can play the travelin wilbury's inside out here, but if you
		      need to dance then diana ross' upside down might do the trick -
		      sure it;s a stretch step down from love child but them were
		      disco days...this ain't no talking haeds, hades, hays hell
		      i wonder how it would be if they hadn't forced me to shave in
		      high school...as if i didn't have enought two ponder, finding
		      a label finds me yet i cannot make out the reason...ie, 
		      emilee video...possibly lotta emilie video day...i think it's
		      four days in my life, is tangled up in blue the russian novel
		      version of the beatles' paperback 'in my life'...i hope and
		      pray your day is nowhere near the convoluted confusion i have
		      come across this friday weekend without saturday...how do i 
		      conclude, obviously with the question, what fucking strings
		      was zakk using that cut him in concert without snapping or
		      popping out, utterly wild...no i didn't know that story until
		      i did. 
		       
		       
		      24 march 
		       
		      once in a weird while now i cannot help but plug in the axe
		      to play along with some song as i notice that in keeping
		      to my extended scale ritual all these weeks and not plugging
		      in well it made me too aggressive in trying to "make" a sound
		      when i would play along to recorded video via my android -
		      with the amp now or maybe with these guitars, i find it obvious
		      that i need to lighten my touch, especially with the plectrum -
		      so very much like sweep picking it is sort of backwards...
		      regardless, i felt very good playing, like no doubt could 
		      enter the non-thinking, reactive approach i took, well there
		      is the 'thinking' of let me try this or that before-hand...
		      but it's a split second proverbial light bulb that is more
		      like counting than consideration...all this to say i think
		      i made the right choice in cutting down the scales to get
		      friendly again with the chords...i was lamenting not being
		      able to find i am the night after seeing the first episode -
		      the woman playing the mom was wickedly good - proving how
		      one performance might elevate another...leter, i did find
		      the rest of it although i had to suffer through 'buffering'
		      and was mostly not disappointed, it was then i learned too
		      that it was based on a true story - the police and ethnic
		      angle got to be a bit too much for me - i had this very
		      strong idea about something lotta had bought...then also
		      trying to recall who brian james was...yes right in the
		      middle of the fourth or fifth episode...i think i even
		      felt i needed to apologize, surely one cannot binge while
		      distracted but then i settled myself by holding my guitar
		      and going through some excercise for a minute or two,
		      meanwhile the hawaii scenes were the highlight for me, 
		      like there was no hurry or any acting at all, it really
		      flowed nicely...the subsequent riots and denouement i 
		      did not like yet i would still say it was worth the view -
		      insane tale...i could understand why it is not on google
		      play or even its mothership tnt which still features the
		      alienist for some reason...anyway, it was evening at
		      that point, i had finally made the steak that'd been 
		      frozen in the freezer for more days than i care to admit-
		      but that was well before the binge, it was when i saw
		      lotta's paris video...after the last couple of videos
		      wherein she seemed intent on going in an unexpected
		      direction or even anxious, it was lovely to see her 
		      obviously happy...i only wished she would have wiped
		      her lenses before shhoting the finale...i thought of
		      emilee and margaret and ashley as i poured myself into
		      bed for sleep...i don't trust my feelings about emilee
		      due to my somewhat gullible nature, i think maggie was
		      merely trying to figure out seeing her with a lap dog -
		      and last but not least i'm pretty sure i was still 
		      surprised that ashley had posed in a bunch of bikinis
		      leaving out the one i said was not a bikini but a disco -
		      i fell asleep foolishly trying to hold on to the image
		      of lotta, i dreamt of some sort of tour dance, i think
		      it might have been on a roof top, guitars hidden in 
		      hard cases were being stacked like they were getting
		      ready to go somewhere...i'd gone up there in an elevator -
		      a high rise i'd never been too - i felt the motley 
		      crew explanation turning, yes at least they were a success
		      where many other countless bands had failed - then a sun
		      burnt billy idol doll was singing mony mony and i picked
		      it up to put place it with the guitar cases...i awoke then
		      it had only been a couple of hours since i went to sleep -
		      i thought about his videos with the cops and how it made
		      me feel like i had a friend in a desperate time, in a 
		      senseless desperation...but i didn't know what to make of
		      it...i had dug my nails deep into my back where the bite
		      itched, or some succubus left her orgasm mark while i 
		      slept the night before this...i could feel it tingle
		      along with the razor cut neck, same side i see now - 
		      but then i didn't see, i surrendered to not knowing
		      and went back to bed, to sleep - i felt alone and 
		      was possibly thinking of mother, i dreamt walking
		      manhattan, the streets not so crowded, a shop had
		      a sort of tote bag in the window with an embroidered
		      vinayaki - the elephant headed goddess which has no
		      exact meaning but arguably cute - language is a virus
		      from outer space...i recall now part of my conversation,
		      when i think of indians i sometimes think of pocahontas
		      which makes me think of grand-mother and then you in that
		      dressed up teen age picture...i suspect wiretappers - 
		      going hindu rather than powhatan...in any case, within
		      the dream i walk into the shop with the intention of
		      getting her the carry bag...somehow i pick up a bottle
		      of pepsi - but suddenly donald, trump not southerland,
		      is fighting me for it in an absurd dance and we are 
		      spinning around without resolution i awake and notice
		      the overhead fan noise, how much sound does it take, not
		      much, it has a rattle click, i imagine him in stutter
		      loop saying the word if, if , if , if, if, if, but obviously
		      it's the loose screw of the contraption...bringing us full
		      circle to the point of not needing to be aggressive while
		      playing since an amplifier often needs only the lightest
		      touch to translate the strum or pluck...sorry if anyone
		      expected politics, i told you i was not political, i only
		      point at it in protest which i nearly did again as the 
		      press posted the shameful notion of k harris for the
		      next election hmm one wonders if m markel will be the 
		      running  mate...it could all be another "nflx"
		      ($920.60) docu-series with t swift songs...whatever,
		      in terms of politics when is someone going to explain
		      all the financial aid that filled up kiev since the
		      folks fled in exodus a thousand days ago...they do
		      claim over five million refugees up and went...somewhere...
		      if only them funds would have gone to education!
		       
		       
		      25 march 
		       
		       i suppose they are saying fuck the children, besides
		      we have enough detention centers and jails for the
		      so called minority population...and so the get your
		      gay marriage regime that the nicknamed boss sucks
		      up to allows his protoge to arrive at the john wilkes
		      booth innuendo as if to remind trumpet that there are
		      democratic notes still in the score...they in turn,
		      it seems to me, leak a signal...with help from the
		      once upon a time relevant atlantic now a remnant of
		      itself looking to attract attention on social media -
		      at least we still have harper's and the index...
		      i myself have yet to come across any displaced ukrainian
		      while rambling through the city landscape...one can only
		      hope the current administration can handle the insurrection
		      of planted stories the new york post ironically seems
		      pleased to report as if it made sense or was worth while,
		      at least the consolation prize of having shakespeare
		      mentioned was something..."i hold my peace? no;
		      i will speak as liberal as the north..."
		      some one said it was the guitar that waas bleeding not
		      zakk wylde, i looked at the video, brazil - sao paolo -
		      indeed the strings were all intact...i researched a 
		      bit more; dunlop...possibly the string lab artist 
		      series...it is said he uses (gauge) 10 - 60...in 
		      contrast i like 9 - 46...but i have no mind to think
		      at present, the music pointed to sydney and deleted
		      kisses - like mirroring the ending of the play, hopefully
		      nobody dies but we all know that is wishful thinking - 
		      like taxes in the certainty...fires in korea, they said.
		      my underarm moist with sweat, but i am not in motion -
		      emotional thinking gene vincent urging eddie cochran to
		      visit london where he was then lonesome and in turn urged
		      sharon sheeley to join him...ending 16 april 1960 taxi
		      ride...weird...i had planned to start my day playing
		      guitar yet got caught up in that story and decided to 
		      care for the plants...balcony...no sign of the shoulder
		      pain i carried around the day before as if i had been
		      holding one of those heavy gibson les pauls i never 
		      much liked because of the weight - in fact i felt
		      all right, having awoken thinking i was in the middle
		      of packing something or other in a sort of slinky 
		      shape, uhm accordion shape, no clue what it was about
		      then thinking of lotta...it would have been near noon
		      on her side of the world. i'm not sure i feel rested,
		      although possibly i am from all the previous leisure - 
		      i did order a pizza yesterday and so that is the other
		      part of my plan for today along with il gattopardo 
		      which i wanted to see for deva cassel as she kept
		      showing up in my tiktok for you page...i can't see
		      monica or vincent in her yet it is exciting to know
		      that in a sense she continues their magic, still
		      i am only at the first episode and a few minutes
		      into the second...i don't like it up to now maybe
		      because she is not there yet and maybe because they
		      put placed too much to carry on the prince...the
		      principal character...it's especially annoying if
		      the patriarchy isn't exactly your cup of tea - for me,
		      it's like looking at a composite version of certain 
		      men i have known...i can't explain this except to
		      say if you understand the song 'happy' you might get
		      what i am getting at; "Always took candy from strangers,
                     didn't wanna get me no trade. Never want to be like papa
		      working for the boss ev'ry night and day..."
		       
		       
		      26 march 
		       
		      at one point, the leopard, it felt like a soap opera...
		      and having seen the actress playing her character, i
		      left it - thinking the hype was only that...thinking
		      i still didn't like it - how could it work? italians speaking
		      in english - sure sure some nice settings and costumes and
		      she is attractive and the nepo baby aspect never feels present
		      even if the hurried recap of her character's life looked as if
		      a set up hinting at that angle...whatever, maybe it was the
		      incorrect time or setting for me...subsequently i stayed up
		      much later than i wanted or expected...i had, without intent
		      to record or mix any songs, decided to get acid pro eleven -
		      the earlier version was the daw i liked most and hoped this
		      would still have some of the features i enjoyed - so nervously
		      smoking a pack a cigarettes as i tried to fix the scan for
		      vst having put placed an entire windows folder for it to review,
		      so twice unistalled to get that out of the way...not a good 
		      start to it and the folks talking about it mostly don't like it,
		      but how can i fight my own nostalgia...getting to sleep finally
		      i found how nice it is to wrap oneself up in a robe when awaking
		      too early and going for a pee - lotta had been on my mind but
		      not in my dreams - where i seemed to be in the city - night - 
		      i was with a woman that was being chased, well hounded, we 
		      ran, i saw a man direct two dogs towards her direction with 
		      an order to stop her...fucking ai dogs, they did exactly that
		      as if robots - looking at them i wondered over animal skull 
		      implants or maybe three d printed canines...we escaped again
		      but they followed and i awoke more curious than frightened - 
		      i dressed then entirely unsure about what time it might be...
		      it was still sort of early but i stayed up with a desire to
		      clean up a bit more, the house that is...well, i should clean
		      myself up too after the bizarre underarm sweating that so 
		      confused me yesterday...yesterday, what was goodly...oh
		      yeah playing along to some stones songs with the ibanez
		      i could hardly believe the ease and to some extent the
		      speed like the guitar missed being played and was showing
		      off - it made me think that the mind is much faster than 
		      anyone can imagine...like those stories of superhuman strength
		      in certain moments of crisis...i'm not saying it was good only
		      that it felt good and i did not expect a mere thought to be 
		      translated or transposed into my hands' rhythm...kind of a 
		      euphoric feeling, yet strange as i usually don't get that
		      intense in sitting around strumming...still nice, i thought
		      and think yet if it is so casual or without intention then how does one
		      make it happen intentionally...most likely it is all about emotion...
		      a feeling...i also felt goodly seeing one of my comments liked
		      although i worried over the spelling of lucia popp, damned f scott
		      fitzgerald, and then liked even more...letterman called his company
		      worldwide pants...it was about trousers, i suppose the worldwide
		      slacks people agreed..."so you look around the tiny room
		      and wonder where the hell you are while the k.k.k. convention are
		      all stranded at the bar - they wear hoods and carry shotguns
		      in the main streets of Montgomery but they're helpless here as
		      babies 'cause they're only here on holiday" 
		       
		       
		      27 march 
		       
		      out of the frying pan and into the fire...yet i love
		      it - in some ego self-righeous selfish way - when i
		      am right...i settled on watching pearl, for no specific
		      reason other than to confirm my instinct...finding i
		      was even more spot on that i could have imagined, i 
		      sat there skipping through it with vindicated pleasure-
		      all the bullshit about it being a good horror film
		      melting away, all the hoopla disappearing...how bad
		      is it? awful. it's only good if you happen to have
		      a prisoner you'd want to torture...i had many chances
		      to see that one but never took them...yesterday i 
		      let the curious part take a peek and so it goes...
		      i made soup and felt iggy pop got a kick out of it
		      somehow...i thought to myself, he's the closest thing
		      we have to dinosaurs...bloody bathroom story memory
		      prolly led me to clean my jacuzzi enviorns...i did
		      the room too with some decorative changes...after
		      my own experiences and california i suppose i am a
		      bit more senstive to news items related to fires,
		      wildfires...although i wasn't worried over the korean
		      one, i am now as i hear they are still burning...
		      my dreams were like the fast flicker of flames, so
		      swift, so slide-show presentation fast, so quick i
		      need to recall them in a fake slow motion - of course
		      that would only be the parts i remember - i woke up
		      thinking it had been like a surreal tv infomercial -
		      someone seemed intent on explaining something like
		      i was stupid, or as they they say now like i'm five,
		      i am not smart in many areas, but i don't think i 
		      am dumb enough to need visual cue cards as the narrative
		      is being negotiated...i am tempted to say it was a 
		      muslim man talking - but would you think sadam hussein 
		      or osama bin laden - my guess was hindu, but that would
		      be racist since pakistan exists and then again egypt
		      which is sunny in a manner of speaking - well let us
		      say i dunno - some dude from a place like that, maybe
		      some dude with a heavy tan putting on an accent for
		      mockery...it's like a dorm outside and i am standing 
		      there watch-waiting as the images swirl and he's yapping
		      away - like he's speaking about me and what i like to 
		      me as if i didn't know - oh yes there's music, he says,
		      the eye lens zooming in on the palm of his hand now 
		      suddenly burdened with different types of creams as if
		      a woman testing shades of blush or lipstick on her forearm
		      at some cosmetics counter - but dig it - the scene is like
		      a split second in real time - maybe i am not even supposed
		      to be hearing it, much less seeing it - that goes on for 
		      a minute with several other 'examples' then he starts 
		      telling about his shoes and some metal or magnet in them
		      that gives a spring to the step as he put it if you were
		      to try to run up the side of a building...they are boots
		      and my eye pans back as i see him start to run up the side
		      of the wall as i wake up feeling no wiser or even interested
		      in who why how where or when well i knew when in terms of
		      my timeline but you get the drift...i was determined to 
		      get up still feeling good about the previous day's ending
		      wherein my love for cinema was vindicated by flight risk -
		      i had no idea or expectation except i saw mel gibson directed
		      it and that was enough for me - and indeed i liked it so much
		      i will shut up about it so as not to sway its vibe for anyone
		      else - nothing else of note to mention, except yesterday
		      i did feel a sense of wanderlust, of wanting to go here or
		      there...i suppose it was missing the jackson west concert,
		      although los angeles ain't exactly my cup of tea.
		       
		       
		      28 march 
		       
		      it was positively a nicole kidman party in my play hours -
		      you remember nicole...to die for...dogville days of thunder
		      the others...if i had to choose-pick one it would be
		      margot at the wedding although yes eyes wide shut is the
		      masterpiece...now i did have some hesitation at holland
		      since the automated management film was - well it was like los angeles -
		      and although it proved itself a higher quality, i was not
		      interested in the mystery...like it was trying to be quirky
		      but needed to be directed by david lynch, as it was it felt
		      well like a tv show - now i only thought this after deciding
		      to watch expats...indeed a tv show but secretly cinematic -
		      even the cast looked as if they were all in...a commitment i
		      didnt sense with holland...but then again i was not having 
		      my best day nor living my best life in that time - no i was
		      in fact looking to escape the day and so naturally the movies -
		      so yeah the tv show felt more like the movie than the film 
		      itself...after giving up my impromptu hunger strike, i made
		      what is now my usual diet...a turkey sandwich drenched in 
		      olive oil and kosher salt...lettuce and lays potato chips...
		      this time both pepsi and sprite...i ate thinking man that
		      woman has been working overtime maybe even sundays but then
		      adjusted my thought since her daughter is named like the last
		      day of the week...later in the evening all this led to me
		      playing along with fifty ways to lose your lover and baby did
		      a bad bad thing...followed by the scale ritual and a few minutes
		      with other styles i am trying to get fluent at...in...in, at...
		      tina, ain't it ai...anti..nati...words words words...i went to 
		      sleep not feeling much wisdom or even like myself - maybe i was
		      still concerned over the uneven look of both my middle toes -
		      i had trimmed my nails thinking of the jewess like i always do
		      now when it comes to manicures...each had skin growth on the 
		      lower ending...i suppose i need to investigate the subject -
		      i tossed and turned in bed but was well asleep before long - 
		      the only other thing i did during my semi-desperate day
		      was request an update for acid pro so that the vst scan 
		      works like most others naturally do - in my dream, i 
		      stumbled upon some sort of strange altar - all sorts of 
		      exotic objects - like a cabinet one uses for china - yet
		      one of the center shelves was more spacious - it had a 
		      head, some decapitated thing sitting there, every time i
		      looked at it, it would transform...another face - and
		      another face until what looked like worms crawled over
		      the pink skin in their white slow wiggle...the cabinet
		      was possibly the most important part of aunt's lost house,
		      i told my sister, that is how the quack killed eva, when
		      she was taking mom's blood pressure, of course a knee jerk
		      verbal reaction, but i suspect it led to the dream...i mean
		      why else would i dream of a cabinet...i'd prolly be adored
		      in dublin...but wait, let me ask you, if the atlantic would
		      have simply shut up about it there would be no story, no?
		      point is when you start contemplating what should or not
		      be said well it's nothing in terms of the big picture - 
		      pig bicture, swine city i falt sad for using murder on the
		      floor everytime the street vendors roared and have switched
		      to dushane's chicken mcnuggets genius ultimate form for now -
		      or why i love america...purple mountain majesty...the news
		      poured out quake...it said thailand, but search engines all
		      said myanmar...they mean burma and the burmese declared a 
		      state of emergency, reportedly. i must have been dreaming
		      when it happened - yes again at the airport yes again partly
		      frantic over the departure time...although this time my
		      luggage looked to be all settled - i thought i was going to
		      belfast but the sign overhead said scotland...and when i 
		      went to get my passport stamped i instead pulled out a 
		      dozen or so beer bottles, half of them pilsner type blonde
		      ales and half of them full bodied brunettes...the lady
		      there at the counter said something that made me think
		      why not continue my sober streak, it was like she was
		      telling me they have beer in edinburgh...i edited the 
		      bottles back into position as if to say then keep these here-
		      i have not been thinking about drinking but maybe since
		      the shop once again claimed to be out of my usual cigarettes
		      i might have been feeling like something was missing...
		      indeed these harsher smokes would work better with beer.
		      i got up early, as i made my dream way onto the runway,
		      i thought about my aunt and how i miss her jovial nature,
		      and mother and how i miss her character...it made me
		      feel spiritually closer to india and especially nicole
		      as i knew their loss...some of the joviality and characteristics
		      are still present yet it would be foolish to expect any further
		      logic from either thus multiplying the grief even before
		      the grieving starts as if one were taking a class in mourning
		      where the homework never gets done in denying or defying
		      the fact...i cannot find myself doing otherwise. 
		       
		       
		      29 march 
		       
		      well there then expats was no let down, there are scenes
		      which exceed wisdom and furthermore it proves how a woman director
		      might give knowledge a twist that would be difficult for
		      men or artificial intelligence to provide...all this to
		      say i was utterly impressed...
		      the day went by without me doing much else except guitar work -
		      well there was some social media scrolling...and a couple
		      of attempts at strategy chess...i failed to get to sleep 
		      early and was still awake at six in the morning stockholm
		      time - i was thinking of lotta and it seemed to me as if
		      it had been a long while since i felt that type of thought - 
		      a type of nearness...like a dream or trance state - yet in
		      my actual dream i don't think it was her...it seemed to 
		      me another woman in a setting i had not imagined - the
		      room therein nothing that would be in design magazines - 
		      sort of like that dude that wrote the wedding march - 
		      his room could only boast a piano well there was a bed too -
		      but that sort of thing without musical instruments - maybe
		      spartan would be the word - two men are there with the 
		      woman and it feels like i am trying to get her away from
		      them, from that place - one of them says, she wants to be
		      with us  - it is neither a rough nor gentle voice, a 
		      neutral voice yet clearly male - for a second i see them
		      engaged in sexual frenzy - emotionless as if they are 
		      merely having intercourse to show me - suddenly she
		      walks right in front of me, i cannot really see her as
		      i could not see exactly what she was doing...she is
		      passing me from left to right, partly naked, partly 
		      bleeding...a third man enters the space from the right
		      and lays down on the floor as she silently straddles
		      him with her back to me - i near her and touch her which
		      seems to snap her out of the orgy mindset - she takes my
		      hand and we rush out to find there are no stairs, the whole
		      area is either under construction or being demolished - 
		      we jump without words onto the lower floor with the worry
		      that it will cave in - another turn and another jump to 
		      the ground floor without that worry - i see the exit,
		      three other men are crowding the doorway - a couple in 
		      military uniform - they move out of the way as we pass
		      through - it is bright outside, i don't like the sun and
		      don;t like the dream and awake...i was started contemplating
		      what it might mean - who it might be about - and now i 
		      see it also gives me the logical reason for my lack of trust -
		      even if i allow my faith to be confident in say miss x - 
		      who is to say that miss x will not be overtaken by others
		      and their scams or schemes...a drugged drink could sink
		      anyone nearly anywhere...i was concerned for lotta and
		      alexander, the first for the pre-dream thoughts and the
		      second as i now feel the irony of the word bottomless - 
		      in terms of those scenes - one could say sure honey i 
		      trust you but not the surroundings...i reckon it's even
		      more extreme in the case of daughters...daddy doesn't
		      sleep a wink knowing the dorm room key card is as flimsy
		      as a paper airplane...anyway, my rangoon point is;
		      objective, burma! 1945 - the burmese harp - 1956 -
		      escape to burma 1955 - a yank on the burma road 1945 -
		      bombs over burma 1942 - burma victory 1945 - rookies
		      in burma 1943 - moon over burma 1940  and burma cowboy 1941 -
		      to mention nine of the films that currently find themselves
		      in a sort of noun limbo due to 'myanmar' - i don't think
		      title editing or switching is an option...does then 
		      burma remain an irony or become exclusive to fiction...
		      dig one translation; birmania, so much more poetic...
		      worse is the capital hmm rangoon now yangon and further now naypyitaw,
		      previously called pyinmana...so even if you learnt your geography
		      correctly you would need to restudy it as if nothing is ever settled,
		      unsettling...yet i do not intend to make light of the dark time
		      that place is being put through - like the idea of a missing child
		      or a drug induced assault, i cannot wholly imagine the burden of
		      such a nightmare yet i wonder if it will make France go well 
		      these two billion francs that we are pouring into the kiev
		      puppet dictatorship could be more useful to myanmar-burma people
		      at present...even if i would take the money to fix the french
		      roads before anything myself...that is, "Roads in rural areas accounted for 60% 
		      of deaths and 48% of serious injuries in 2024, and 1,928 people were
		      killed on roads in rural areas (51 more than in 2023, i.e. +3%)."
		      from onisr.securite-routiere.gouv.fr but why would macron care if
		      part of the population is lost?
		       
		       
		      30 march 
		       
		      eggless fried rice, i was too into 'walk like a dragon' to worry or
		      wonder if it meant anything...later finding mel torme's comin' home baby...
		      the film and the song are gems...nobu atsumi mccarthy played kim sung in 
		      that 1960 film...obviously i need to review her credits for the film
		      list, but suddenly there is also bruce glover and richard chamberlain...
		      i believe he was involved with some james clavell project, ie the director
		      of 'walk like a dragon'...the thing is i need to get other things together
		      as well...shave, dishes, well yeah me and the dishes all need shaving - 
		      i also want to eat and i have been wanting to eat since last night - 
		      somehow it is already early afternoon turning late - i need to keep
		      calm and remember i can do it all in a couple of hours - i only slept
		      a couple of hours when i awoke from the dream wherein i was looking
		      at myself yet my face was robyn's...robyn stephens...at that point i 
		      was trying to send crispin spiritual condolences...lamenting i had
		      not seen his hotel movie...but still thinking about the fried rice, 
		      and to some extent lotta who had taken the oyster bar trip - 
		      i went to sleep after a few cigarettes and coffee and slept through
		      the morning only somewhat concerned that i would be late for her
		      sunday video...i didn't look at the mirror when i did rise again
		      after dreaming of looking through a jewelry box that held no 
		      real interest for me...they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
		      but i only partly believe that logic...so myabe i do resemble 
		      robyn, but i will be sure upon shaving - as it is i am only
		      making light of the dream since i am not as handsome as she is
		      beautiful...when i got to the video i thought lotta was beautifully
		      frantic...she was having a japanese meal, but i got the feeling
		      there was something else she wanted to say...i hope she gets
		      a gig to tokyo, i suspect she will even feel at home there...
		      anyway she said a lot but i couldn't come to any conclusions...
		      it was much like the style presented right before her second
		      trip to paris...well, i suppose it's a wait and see situation -
		      i guess there's a lot more i could say-tell yet silence is still
		      golden...i reckon to come full circle in this jot-scribble, the
		      only jewelry i wear is a ring i self-made from a stainless steel
		      spoon with the triangle there and the label No.305 china...middle
		      finger of the right hand, that side's thumb partner when the plectrum
		      is in play. 
		       
		       
		      31 march 
		       
		      Monday. I had - as I suppose many or most logical folks do - forgot
		      the fact that the ending of life's contract is death. This music
		      played despite the near-daily dive into the obituary sections of
		      sometimes several publications. In this case, I am speaking about
		      the Korean series with Park So-Dam entitled Death's Game...
		      Maybe I should have taken my suspicion more seriously when I 
		      happened to feel the sensation of fear as someone began talking
		      of a parade they were viewing via the television...Oh no, I 
		      thought and translated my opposition to the matter suggesting
		      church, it was Sunday, or the Flinstones...Now, when I found
		      the show, I remembered the time I had spent looking for it so 
		      as not to miss Park's work - having seeing most everything else...
		      I took in three or four episodes after cleaning the kitchen and
		      the argument with nobody in particular that I had ordered a five
		      piece meal and had only got four...She plays death the premise
		      is a suicide being punished by having to experience dying a 
		      dozen times until going to hell unless he can escape in one
		      of the incarnations...it's brilliant but I kept thinking how
		      stupidly the character reacted after living as a student he
		      finds himself in jail yet does not think to survive - to
		      escape instead going head first into battles which in themselves
		      could get him killed or consequently thereafter resurface as
		      vengeance but it was a hard luck character and perhaps that
		      balances it like being incarnated into a baby...well, i should
		      wait to evaluate it when it is concluded...they term it a thriller
		      and there it is thrilling but i could not help thinking, dude,
		      shave your head, pretend to be a monk or something, and duck
		      away from everything and everyone...perhaps it is what the 
		      writers intended you to think - i will try to get through it
		      later today. Monday. I had - as I suppose some guitarists do -
		      gone through my ritual while being baffled by the chameleon character -
		      then once again skipped working on the list which will be the first
		      thing i get to after this note...it's one of those jobs that, for me,
		      require a certain amount of inspiration - a disposition or inclination
		      since sometimes an image comes into play and while art might be
		      thrown together this way or that it seems i prefer to have the feeling
		      first...since feeling is first...who pays any attention to a battery
		      wrapped in a white t-shirt put placed next to the electricity counters
		      with the dislodged metal door in the building...i had thrown out the
		      trash and found that so very strange...stranger still was the sensation,
		      like a rush of contradictions upon going to bed...collar bone pain as
		      if being pressed or pressured...both sides, right and left in that
		      order and then what can only be called a migraine - bursting throb
		      of temple anguish so bad i got up to see if there was breaking news...
		      the cell phone notified me of a fire in bishop and i figured it was
		      that since now flames in california feel as if they could go out of
		      control - i had been thinking of jihoon yet that makes it sound as
		      if i were in control...i was not, the thought was there as if intent
		      on telling me something but the beethoven in me kept me blind...
		      i actually made more coffee and had a few cigarettes before imagining
		      the fire being settled and the evacuations reversed...in my dream,
		      i'm with a grey version of jerry garcia and there are other guys
		      from the band and he is rolling a cigarette most likely weed which
		      i am expecting to puff upon - he leaves a leaf like section squared
		      out for no reason like he's using e z wider and made the joint with
		      one wing...weir smokes after him and he smokes again then hands me
		      the thing halfway done and wingless yet still nowhere near a so-called
		      roach - i take a rich few seconds watching the ember shine and hand the
		      thing to weir thinking that is how it should go - i might have woken up
		      then surprised over the scene - i'd seen videos of the dead and co where
		      garcia's alligator strat was being played on stage...it's a trip in itself
		      to gaze upon it...for me, a divided sensation, like man that is cool to
		      see but also like man that's jerry's axe...a few weeks ago i had entertained
		      the idea of decorating one of my guitars in that fashion, there are even
		      sets of sitckers on sale which have the alligator, harley davidson, and
		      police helper decal all included...but i thought it would be disrespectful
		      and opted for my own design scheme...i might have awoken but i was still
		      drowsy enough to not notice reality then found myself dreaming again, this
		      time a woman, at her place - we are standing there talking...i am telling
		      a story that now escapes me - something of a prank i pulled on someone - 
		      she seems terribly excited by the notion of my wicked humor - i have
		      the sense that it is dakota yet i am acting and she is too as if we had
		      met before, like a friend...well, maybe we are friendly - the scene is
		      flying, like time is on speed...in a wink of an eye i find myself returning -
		      although i never felt myself leaving - walking into the building, i would
		      say hotel but there are several many or even a lot of buildings with doormen -
		      this one seems to be on friendly terms with dakota or the woman in the
		      dream as i reach the elevator he queries so did you really pull that prank
		      on your own...i grin and confess in the positive to his curious countenance 
		      not thinking how or why or even much about privacy - was it a private story
		      i shared with her - is anything private anymore, was it ever...there's
		      no business like show business should have been playing but instead the 
		      elevator turned into a staircase and i was carrying a packpack with lettuce -
		      her roommate or someone near enough to answer her door sprung out informing
		      me that the food was nearly done and i turned for her to grab the lettuce
		      so that there'd be salad too - i could see fish and chicken being fried
		      separately, she asked like you only ever used to hear on airplanes - 
		      if i wanted the chicken or the fish - always in fear of bad seafood, i 
		      said the chicken of course. i got up then - greeted the cat, skirt has
		      had a few days where he takes to making sure i am here or there then the
		      speech about how things are going with him which usually ends upon 
		      the nilk and friskies...i felt myself blaming the combination of mother's
		      good wishing irony and david lynch's missing pieces for something or other
		      but then came to my senses not with an apology since it still might be true
		      but why bother - why make it a thing, if it was even my thing...indeed since
		      feeling is first...further into now. the blame even when blatant is always
		      a point of view...that is to say even if someone kills you, it's up to you
		      to die. 
		       
		       
		      april one  
		       
		      i'm looking at the overturned penske truck on kneeland and harrison
		      in boston;s chinatown...i had a minute ago been dreaming of vicmary,
		      i don't really know her much but i sure felt myself rubbing my crotch
		      against her knee behind her mother's back...i'd been exhausted, having
		      got up early after going to bed late - even a chord i long ago knew
		      and took for granted became unfamiliar...what is that...imagine that
		      the g major a sudden mystery on the seventh fret...i knew then i was
		      in need of rest and relaxation...in way of clearing up what might be
		      a confusing statement, it was the jackson flying v which itself presents
		      the fretboard to me as if new...but still, once in a while the only thing
		      to do is hit the hay...hey hey my my...of course the main thing i thought
		      about was this couple of paragraphs from the los angeles times:
		      "Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, home to the oldest trees in the world, 
		      is in the White Mountains, about 20 miles east of Bishop, and is threatened by the fire,
		      according to Cal Fire spokesperson Chloe Castillo. So far, none have been destroyed in the blaze.

Some of these trees are more than 4,000 years old and still growing, dating to the Bronze Age. The forest
		      includes the Methuselah Tree, which may be the oldest living organism on Earth. 
		      In an effort to protect the tree, the U.S. Forest Service does not disclose its exact location..."
		      but yes, also the fact the rest of my 'haul' was sent out and is due to be shipped
		      out in a day day two...i am concerned over the date since it might arrive
		      on or about holy week...but hopefully by the end of this april i will get
		      my guitars set up in the fashion i wanted or wished...
		      where was i ah yes death's game, it got wicked good although i felt there
		      was bit too much mothering near the end but that might be for what i am going
		      through and intellectually it is wonderful to see drama take the time
		      to tell a woman's story in full...so i can fully recommend this series
		      without hesitation. later in my dream i was walking with a woman down 
		      a hundred and ninth street - the cathedral building might be entered or
		      exited from there or a hundred and tenth...i thought it was mother but
		      now i am not so sure as it was dark night and i was walking the way i 
		      usally did before someone pointed out how it appeared to them, that is
		      to say not exactly looking up, head bowed - eyes upon the pavement - 
		      in the dream it was like that but i could see my legs and her legs and
		      she said she wanted to pee as if i were the parent and she were a child -
		      so we stopped and she half squatted - i noticed the stream, i noticed
		      too lights as if police car coming up the hill - that streets when walking
		      eastward feels like you are in san francisco steepness or something
		      as it leads you into a more level central park and east side beyond -
		      we cross i suppose for no exact reason except one of my songs about
		      buying cocaine is set in that place - she starts to piss again and 
		      it is more than i can explain - well like a horse...i awake thinking
		      how strange and feeling as if i had been put through a work out instead
		      of dreaming...at least i had obtained a carton of the cigarettes i wanted,
		      cleaning my room some i waited to hear from the other place which did 
		      call but only to report that yet again they had not re-stocked. 
		      i was shocked by alpha dog a few times, in that it was a true story -
		      in that i didn;t recognize anton yelchin, in how angelic amanda was and
		      is and most likely will be...also the only part of it i actually enjoyed.
		      well, at least for trivia it had one of the few mentions of paraguay in
		      cinema...funny, i can see the view from my three k room, the lights
		      from the renovated buildings on 109th street and my thoughts wondering
		      if the curtains were indeed covering the window - martin made a ceo 
		      guitar and i told caitlin erin oneill about it, she actually liked it.
		      i have made unsettled plans to go to paris on air france with julia
		      mecey but i can't figure out how to handle all the details...even
		      for a few days i think the cat would freak out...well, this can all
		      be settled later on down the line...for now i will surely try the
		      axe again concentrating on the g major so as to get that glitch 
		      out of my system...then again it may simply be that i was telling
		      more truth than i thought when mentioning that certain 'new' techniques
		      felt as if i were starting to learn the instrument all over again...
		      ps, acid pro wroted back without an exact resolution yet i deployed
		      my concern in other words and hopefully they will get that vst scan
		      fixed in proper fashion. 
		       
		       
		      april two 
		       
		      i thought later maybe ihad got - hey when will apple make an ihad-
		      hmm, ihead...ihold...ihide...well i was thinking maybe i had got
		      mixed up with the lady from the bank that phoned right before i 
		      went back to the guitar - it was for someone else but later in 
		      the evening i found myself dreaming of some type of bank work -
		      but i haven't met that woman...no other dream to report after 
		      being startled by the notification that val kilmer had passed
		      away...the director of heat had just been talking about the
		      sequel...i was thinking of that film and tombstone although
		      the only real memory i keep about the vk, is the riot he 
		      caused in me when he did the narration for some film as
		      an added feature...it was more powerful than drugs, i literally
		      could not stop laughing...in fact it's one of the few things
		      i remember about the apartment on sarasota...all this to say
		      it is next to impossible to feel sorrow, even upon his death,
		      when my thoughts rush to that joyous moment and still make
		      me smile or even giggle...no i was not giggling over the 
		      news, but i am confident you get the point...even in telling
		      my side of the story here, it is that pleasure that remains...
		      now then, feeling the ease of being rested, i brought myself
		      to one of my axes with an outlook on the together notes we
		      term chords...given the seventh fret incident, but i found
		      no issue and i suppose it will be a one-off thing i can
		      torture myself with...sure, you are good but remember the
		      time you forgot that g major on the seventh fret, hahaha...
		      and so on...it'a a good thing guitar players don't need
		      to de-classify their scale and chord dossier to themselves
		      before playing...i had heard black bag was a decent film
		      and made immediate plans to view it - i made soup and tried
		      to not think about how excited kevin and kyra had been...
		      later i understood how a married couple could, would or did
		      find this exceptional...my thought was why are some australian
		      actresses so darn good - bravo, cate - along with trying to recall where i had
		      seen the male protagonist - ah yeah, the killer, 2023...dang
		      that seems so long ago...i didn't put place pepper in the broth
		      this time and either i was too hungry to miss it or maybe it is
		      merely overkill given the oregano...i played guitar again - no
		      mail order mystics in d or i smell smoke in g minor - simply fiddling
		      through nothing in particular and trying to rid myself of the
		      weird pressure i feel as if being pushed to 'perform' where it
		      is not my intent...my goal is to keep up with the ritual...
		      to which i have added a bit of chord work since i haven;t really
		      tried a song since deep elem blues except for the exploration into
		      all of me in b flat - early in the afternoon i felt flat and further
		      flattened myself on one of the beds for nap although i had been flat
		      on my back while watching the spy thriller on the sofa...i took
		      that nap yet without any exact dream as if i were thinking or overthinking
		      until getting up to find that it was yet very early in the day...
		      maria posted a picture of a horse, then herself with the same horse
		      and for a minute i felt the desire to create art again yet it has
		      yet to become a catalyst - like my idea for marie anne;s picture...
		      or even the film list which i did update without including any new
		      photographs or animations...i hope one of these days i will feel
		      that feeling once more and delve into it to have some sort of completion.
		      i know that i will never have a good a time, in terms of what is now
		      often called LOL, as i did with val's hilarious narration once upon a
		      time...
		       
		       
		      april five 
		       
		      a saturday ah saturday aha saturday i suppose i should surrender
		      to something or other yet there's nothing specific on my mind
		      leading me this way or that...i've been playing a fair amount
		      of guitar somehow going against my decision to work on a daily
		      song...by that i merely mean repeating one in varying or different
		      ways in order to feed that aspect of music...i think it was
		      diamond joe, the other time i did that although obviously
		      i did consider deep elem blues a bit but that was a recorded
		      practice or exercise - i didn't continue with it as i did with
		      the other...well, i suppose i need to find one appealing enough
		      to fit into that definition...before going to bed last night
		      i read that story about the nurse, she had been trying to have
		      a child for a couple of years, hailey also a popular social 
		      media person they say, but according to reports died moments
		      after giving birth to a son...i suppose i was more upset for
		      the child than for her yet in any case a heartbreaking ending
		      to life for her and an anguishing start to life for him...
		      here i have yet to find the inspiration to fill in the picture
		      side things and i have had a few dream scenes which i will
		      make note of subsequently but i have not felt a connection to
		      them instead i have felt them as if something or someone were
		      trying to pull on the puppet strings of rapid eye movement - 
		      which is the reason for waiting before jotting them...i think
		      i mentioned earlier the contradiction of sitting around without
		      anyone in mind yet finding it crowded or a crowd when going
		      to sleep...i have the weirdest time trying to answer why that
		      would be - trying to decipher it - in the film becoming led
		      zeppelin there is one scene with a revolving door next to the
		      performing platform...i'd say the pre-dream moments have been
		      like some sort of revolving door, faces - some seductive some
		      returning yet not in the dreams themselves...i understand that
		      at a certain time certain people might want a certain thing 
		      and possibly hide behind someone like me in order to gain
		      whatever the vantage point might be...or so i reckon as i 
		      ponder the bizarre matter...in any case, the film was 
		      amazing for the very simple fact that it makes you realize
		      how beautifully intense music might be...you might say
		      yeah, but if you delve deeper then you find that these
		      songs exists within memory and beyond it - with many or
		      most other bands, there is often an invisible time stamp -
		      perhaps when it was discovered or maybe the event wherein
		      it became entagled or caught up in...so while logically
		      i should relate some riffs with say carol miller i don't
		      because these blues are too much to be boxed into a get
		      the led out episode you see - in the film there is a 
		      juxtaposition of a carnival type concert tent and the 
		      nasa exploration of the lunar surface but listening to
		      the song you get that it is before and after that time
		      and place...like it had always been and always will be -
		      now i will contradict my idea by saying that going to 
		      california is unlike all the others time-stamped for
		      me since it is one of the first songs i learnt and 
		      let in my then lover to listen...when i did get to 
		      los angeles i never thought of her or them or even the
		      song...still the idea feels true despite the 
		      possible anomaly - the movie ended and i wished it had
		      gone on a few more hours until in through the out door or
		      coda...i was thanking the genesis groove that brought
		      jimmy page to the yardbirds and got led zeppelin going -
		      i was feeling extra good over my kramer since eddie of
		      that name had helped to put together the second album -
		      now when i think of mothership i will recall how it was
		      john paul jones' mother that insisted he go and try to 
		      join that band although he was rather a success already
		      as a session player...in my own playing i need to stop
		      trying to compensate for the sound by pressure at the
		      pick strum or even fret hold when it is not amplified...
		      otherwise i will continue to develop two differing styles
		      without a need for it - i had dreams of my uncle without
		      rhyme or reason which held nothing to note and possibly
		      were more about my sister than myself given her current
		      relationship and the fact that it is a known pitfall in
		      her life which i suspect she has been trying to escape
		      for a while now even once having her work laptop wind
		      up in his town upon being left in a car going in that
		      direction or so i heard anyway waking up she was on my
		      mind and that is how i came to this conclusion - contrary
		      to anything it seems, i again dreamt i was in three k,
		      the kitchen there was a short narrow hall next to the
		      front door and opposite the entrance closet - i was 
		      bent down trying to entice some rodent or roach out of 
		      the cabinet crawl space by pouring clorox as i stepped
		      back instead a man with the face of a panther alike
		      the cat people feline towered over me but suddenly 
		      disappeared as a woman emerged dressed in black as 
		      if julie newmar from the original series - i fell
		      to my kness and asked what i could do in terms of
		      saving myself from this conundrum she said you must
		      be poor of power...maybe it was pour our power...i'm
		      not sure i had been in the living room before as if 
		      it mirrored my now space instead of guitars - people
		      lined up on of them i distinctly did not like - she
		      was brunette and i didn't recognize her - i awoke thinking
		      of the switch box that i believe held the label bryant
		      park - brian might have been in the dream but that part 
		      was vague and i have not seen or heard from him in a
		      considerable stretch...i got up a bit distracted and
		      lingered or loitered with a lazy directionless feeling
		      until i thought about naomi...she brought to mind the
		      only other naomi i have ever met - well i'm not counting
		      watts - who used to install herself in aunt's 36 house for
		      coffee and conversation...one of the kids once put placed
		      exlax in the brew making her exit nearly instantly - i admit
		      it was kind of funny seeing someone limp in a hurry - i never
		      asked or knew what exactly was the matter with her leg...i
		      remember her house as pretty european for san francisco...
		      having been there once on orders to help move something or
		      other...well, i had some other dreams that didn't want to
		      be recalled although i did awake thinking to write it down -
		      drowsy and then dreaming again it was evening in the city,
		      a street without cars, several people scattered but none
		      of us moving...a woman rushed up to me with a knife and
		      stabbed me under the right collar bone somehow missing
		      ribs as it went in smooth...startled but not hurt i got 
		      up thinking about jennifer...the actress not the swede...
		      i'm not familiar with pjharvey's pocket knife...hmm, maybe
		      it was acdc jealousy...
		      "Who your leader? Who your man?
Who will help you fill your hand?
Who's your friend and who's your foe?
Who's your Judas? You don't know..." still, why was i standing there watching
		      her cross the avenue and come at me as if a dream, well
		      a dream within a dream...in other words if you see someone
		      arrive at your nearness with a weapon do make an effort to
		      not wait and see as it might be result like that...
		      what is love? feeling accomplished that someone you admire
		      was in your dream and left a wound. what a wonderful world...
		       
		       
		      april six 
		       
		      i found myself in the middle of the road yet again, 
		      this time in the dream i was seemingly heading out,
		      i wore a suit and there was a woman walking with me
		      on the left side, we stepped off the walkway as if to
		      wait for a taxi cab, she wore a contrasting light dress
		      that is to my dark suit, and i asked her how she felt
		      to which she answered that felt the cold biting at her 
		      skin - the gown was sleeveless and i removed my blazer
		      and put placed it across her shoulders - she smiled
		      and i awoke...i'm pretty sure it was cathedral parkway
		      yet i cannot be certain as the scene only focused on
		      her and myself...earlier i had dreamt of aunt eva yet
		      in such a vague manner that no details emerge from it
		      and if i were to attempt a note it would be more about
		      other memories than any dream itself...my thoughts were
		      not crowded and my rest was fuller given ten milligrams
		      of some sleep potion...however, in pre-dream thoughts
		      i was confronted by the nearby sounds of a man sneezing,
		      a dog barking, and a woman laughing as if not so much 
		      entertained but to be heard...i even got up and looked
		      at westcreek guitars now somehow more interesting given
		      their free international shipping policy...i kept my
		      robe on when i went back to bed, back to sleep and 
		      awoke to a weird nocturnal emission without any memory
		      of a wet dream..."All these years, I've been wanderin' around
Wonderin' how come nobody told me
All that I been lookin' for was somebody who looked like you..." i imagine
		      it wasn't even during an erection as the wetness was 
		      well below the thigh...in the opposite direction of
		      the erection as i awoke...talk about someone pulling
		      your leg...sure i thought of lotta and her porn star
		      martini...girls night out, felicitas had one too, 
		      the sight of her friend with a spiderweb shoulder tattoo
		      was intense...i was not about staying awake and pondering
		      or wondering the who what how or why - no point in crying
		      over proverbial spilled milk - i knew part of the where,
		      at least my part...but i also knew that i had not had
		      a good night's sleep in a few days...i felt however
		      easier in the fact that i didn't sense the crowding...
		      sure julia and julia came to mind and india and jihoon
		      too but it all felt contained...to some extent logical -
		      i viewed lotta's new video, but i felt someone else's
		      seduction - as if being pulled away somehow...i thought
		      it can't be her but was not sure who else it might be -
		      laura sophia went for her sunday run and i went to sleep
		      where the dreams were easy yet nothing exact to report
		      herein...unlike aunt's sequence, these were all very
		      quick moments as if racing against each other in some
		      rapid eye movement juxtaposition...once in a while, sitting
		      around with a coffee and cigarette later they do return
		      to mind but i don't think it will be the case today...
		      i'm already well into further thoughts...i had meant
		      to mention that i viewed manhattan, the film  - not the
		      town...truly like visiting an old friend and getting
		      fired up at the thought that once upon a time you could
		      literally usher in the fall with a yearly woody allen
		      film...for many new yorkers it would have been a logical
		      ritual...i have a distant memory of attending one film,
		      maybe hannah and her sisters, and watching it from the
		      steps since the seats of the place were packed...gee, i
		      haven't actually been to a movie house since quantum 
		      of solace...that particular theater shut down so now
		      there is no nearby movie house...except my cell phone
		      as it were...speaking of which that is where i watched
		      mickey seventeen - this one is not for the hardened types
		      or the jaded ones, there is a poetry to it that requires
		      your inner child's emotion to hear it...i suppose i am
		      immature enough to have liked it although my grown up
		      parts were once in a while doing the math on suspicion
		      of how it was cast for broadcast...luckily its difficult
		      for me to succumb to gossip even when it seems to start
		      up in my own head...it's a good thing, since anytime
		      self-doubt strikes a pose i eventually shrug it off...
		      who me? ha! let me show self-doubt how much hubris i 
		      have in store...stop, there it is - i was spying in 
		      a dream as if perched upon a ventilation duct above
		      two mean looking 'guards' the word implies guardian
		      but from my experience they all mostly are do-nothing
		      but stare at others from their uniforms and sentry sounds so formal...too
		      formal, so i'm there in the dream not knowing why or
		      what - then in a sudden switch i am by the cashiers
		      who none of them have bags - it seems i had gone shopping,
		      there was a woman with me - one i cannot recall - and she
		      finds these plastic bags - two or three of them, they 
		      do not have the supermarket label instead doritos in 
		      big bold letters...i find that weird enough to have it
		      stick in my mind just like the colorful residue of those
		      chips make fingertips fuzzy...we pick up the shopping 
		      and leave...now this was the dream part i awoke from
		      in confusion and should have been wroted before but it
		      only came to mind now - lotta said she paid thirty five
		      euros for her soiree to the store...people, and perhaps
		      rightly so are concerned over the economy...myself
		      i think twice about ordering restaurant food not that
		      there are many places left to order from...a glimpse
		      at older yellow pages gives you a good idea of how they
		      have dwindled...so there is a sort of guilty feeling,
		      in that i am well aware that many others do not have
		      such options...yet hunger and not finding any thrill 
		      or satisfaction in the kitchen makes me go through
		      the motions of placing an order more often than i 
		      like or should...my desire for more guitars might
		      bring this to a natural conclusion since several 
		      orders would match the price of certain new axes...
		      and yet i will most likely be going against my
		      own logic in a while if only to escape the confines
		      of the kitchen...insane to think that soul kitchen
		      is one my favorite songs..."Well, the clock says
		      it's time to close now. I guess I'd better go now..."
		      ps, wadsworth bryant & bulldog panel, i missed mentioning
		      that would have been the name of the electrical circuit
		      i was thinking about two days ago.
		       
		       
		      april seven 
		       
		      i couldn't find my way into dreams like i wanted,
		      that is early...i got up and played around with
		      guitar town, peggy sue, and lost highway...
		      lennon did it in c and i knew it was weird
		      but i didn't really react to my own instict
		      until later, for the ironic record, lost highway
		      is in d but eventhough that would be more natural
		      for my voice, it's in e that i feel it works...
		      in any case all that to say i am fiddling around
		      with songs as a whole even bringing vocals into
		      play...i suppose i am excited over the coming 
		      haul...held a bizarre dream as i watched a man
		      undress before me...there was a sense that i knew
		      who it was although i didn't except that the person
		      i thought it was then produced other scattered thoughts
		      but i didnt feel any interest in it - as if someone
		      was trying to mock or pass judgement...on him that
		      is...as i was barely aware of the proceedings or their
		      meaning except like i said i thought for a minute it
		      knew who it might be - the phone rang a dozen times
		      and i twirled in bed thinking surely someone had 
		      passed away to get me this much ringing and i opted
		      to get up only to hear it was for the transaction that
		      was sent friday and was to arrive soon...i'm supposed
		      to go out shopping but i have no inclination for it...
		      coffee, cigarettes, mining, collecting points, and
		      social media glances...does anyone know if the tiktok
		      messages are real...i mean, wouldn't you check out
		      the link and drop a line via email...or has email gone
		      out of style...it's only for spam notes, possibly...
		      the schools were are closed in germany and dylan grant
		      died...the bull rider, they called him...i thought of
		      emilee of course and even keira then obviously gotta
		      serve somebody bob...lotta had got up very early and
		      gone to the gym for pilates...by the time i got around
		      to her posting she was already wondering what to do with
		      the rest of her day...for some reason i did not feel any
		      emotion, as if i had not seen her somehow...suddenly
		      i felt a very powerful emotion from mariia ariia...as 
		      if she was trying to hold me or hold on to me...she's
		      the type of woman that makes all the fuss the beatnik
		      poet poured out about holiness make sense - i suppose
		      it;s a void of evil purity...to put it in simpler in
		      terms, if i met a dog it would most likely not be friendly
		      and if she met a dog it would most likely fall in love...
		      in fact, i've seen it happen...a complete stranger of
		      a canine entirely gone gaga over seeing her as if saying
		      take me home with you...so i was happy for a minute that
		      i at least knew about her and so on...she posted one 
		      possible definition of the bra you might imagine tom
		      was talking about when singing about kathleen in filipino
		      box spring hog and i guess that augmented my excitement -
		      then i found she had gone in to get an ear piercing...
		      it was all too much for me and i listened to vince lee
		      and sophie lord doing drop down mama...sleepy john estes,
		      i hadn't knowd it before...thought it was cool...i made
		      a grilled cheese thing and had it with chips and a sprite -
		      phoned mother still wondering how she came to her point
		      of view in terms of children...unless they are your 
		      kids i don't want to deal with them...i put placed
		      black market baby cover on the main page...thinking
		      about the sharon tate dancing video i had edited for it...
		      the something about seeing joan collins sent me down the
		      release road for easter...ie, that should be out soon,
		      maybe even in time for its namesake date...i hope to
		      clean up the house and then reward myself with an onion
		      and lettuce salad drenched in lime juice and olive oil
		      but the clean up does make me hesitate, some cook some
		      do not cook, some things cannot be altered...
		      post-script, i skipped through something called dreamland,
		      a title with margot robbie - she wasn't bad, but the
		      film cannot be called good...if memory serves she played
		      sharon tate in some other not so memorable or merely ironic film...
		      anyway by this pojnt i got through the main points of my cleaning
		      plan...i listened to johnny winters, serious business...the first
		      three tracks; master mechanic - sound the bell - and murdering blues.
		      i had prior to that heard him talking about his influences and
		      playing style...when he mentioned the thumb-pick, i was reminded
		      of the actual manner in which i awoke - my right side thumb had
		      part of the nail fractured on the outer side and there was a 
		      splinter poking the inner side top part...one of those mysteries
		      that would be impossible to explain -- i thought of the line,
		      i have an awareness in my thumb, i put placed the still brand new
		      tweezers to work...pulling out the stabbing thread and yet not
		      knowing what it could be or how it went down - i even saved it to
		      secure some knowledge but it is such a flimsly thing, like wire
		      like wood...a sliver of a thing without an exact voice yet powerful
		      enough to sting...as the songs wailed i wondered if the ghost of
		      johnny winter was asking me to give the thumbpick another try...
		      i liked it for the tight hold it held and it would be darn difficult
		      to drop while playing but i'm not into the finger pluck or picking
		      as it feels less controlled than the flatpick - still, when he
		      spoke about the slide i did learn that his was a pipe - neither
		      glass (he could never get a bottle neck to break right) nor brass would do for him and he liked the full range of it
		      since it covered all six strings...i've made a few and even got a 
		      new one recently but i think i will try his idea down the line,
		      in terms of the slide...hmm, seen zztop play it on the middle finger,
		      a rare set up - that i did try already and it's pretty enjoyable to 
		      have the index and ring free not to mention the pinky...
		       
		       
		      april ten 
		       
		      there was nobody to run against josiah quincy the third,
		      ie, ninety seven percent of the vote in boston, mass.
		      a shoe holds - bless you - the foot, hopefully far
		      from the mouth. weeze is a breathing noise, but
		      also a quiet town in germany. the weezer wife
		      was filmed while being shot by the los angeles
		      police department and they said booked for murder...
		      the battle of mocopulli saw the so-called patriots
		      fail to overtake the royalist, south of here, in
		      chile lands over the hills and far away...
		      there's nobody to indict when a natural catastrophe
		      gives folks a great big bear hug...i'd somehow
		      not thought of the line by the pricking of my
		      thumb something wicked this way comes - when i 
		      awoke from a whirlwind of dreams - champagney is
		      where in france the saint-louis coal mine disaster
		      killed twenty and injured sixteen...later i wondered
		      who the hell goes to a night club on a monday night
		      as the stray bits of news insisted on my listening -
		      i used to go by there a lot but for the burger king
		      not the dancing...the place looked sturdy and therefore
		      i concluded it was a supernatural happening...but like
		      the myanmar lands formerly known as burma, nobody cares
		      too much...it's not like tariffs or celebrity scandals...
		      death tolls of three thousand sixty and death tolls of
		      two hundred twenty one are talked about without soul -
		      hmm two hundred...yes some of these things mentioned 
		      went down two hundred years three months and eight
		      days ago...just off howard mill road, the defoor apartments
		      has its own website...yes, 1824defoor dot com - 
		      the red cross pickup truck was trying to manipulate
		      traffic as i missed the fact that i had just passed
		      italia fifteen, speaking of real estate, on my way
		      back from a convoluted cigarette run - taking us to style;
		      for women; waistlines were on the descent, 
		      as the "Empire" silhouette vanished...
		      the dropping waistline gave way to wider skirts and sleeves...
		      for the non-productive sex, the trousers were a narrow
		      fit reaching the shoe top yet wide-cut cossacks pants 
		      became a variation which were pleated into a waistband
		       fitted to the ankle all inspired the Czar visiting London
		      a decade before...by the following year trousers had fully
		      dethroned their predecessor, pantaloons...how many places
		      are there and how many for a poet...i reckon the poet
		      has only one place that is to say his muse...in the last
		      couple of days i've been here and there, stockholm,
		      athens, new york, los angeles, berlin, but somehow like
		      the general i always find myself returning to my west point,
		      the room with a milwalkee poster although i had no uniform
		      three k...in pre-dream scenes i can only say i saw a woman
		      in a naked blur as if taking a picture of herself, myself
		      i have no dreams lately to report possibly for overthinking -
		      although winona i thought had moved in to what was sister's
		      room and later the storage space where i found yohimbe among
		      other things yet it could have been rachel...then last night
		      there again but in the main bedroom a woman with legs that
		      seemed to go on and on impossibly so i tranced out in the
		      gaze of her maze and awoke thinking of the t-rex song
		      jewel...austrian airlines tells me they still have meal
		      options...theatre am karntnertor, vienna is where the
		      choral was first heard by the crowd...D minor Op. 125,
		      you would know it as the ninth symphony...i imagine
		     james pink, my brother, as an all powerful angel, allows
		      me to go beyond the mere present and into before, so i dedicate
		      this to him with the apology that it isn;t an ode to joy.
		       
		      there will be nobody to race against when you have gone
		      the distance.
		       
		       
		      april twelve
		       
		      Carolina meet but me I did kiss her calf. 
Jackson West methinks North Carolina. 
I said lyrics so maybe it was a rally. 
While more seriously to Sierra Levesque. 
that came to mind even while John Wick, 
Film series Johnny Depp durned town. 
The shower was steaming in three k, 
Aunt laly at the door asking for pills. 
 
We dream, butt stained fruit of the loom. 
Then wonder why or how, refrain jewel. 
how in e minor. yes i said no, he knew 
a wizard in france, i recall mother 
cleaning father's...brian seltzer 
learnt a new trick...i recall the 
whiskey soaked lawyer bragging that 
since being married he did nto have 
to even touch his underwear a woman's 
work is never done... 

At the fireside, lotta stood i was sad and lonely, 
often will the bosom swell with sadness  
at remembrance of the faraway ole what does it signify 
how our noble dior fell to its knees for jihoon 
how I thought of deep purple's my woman from tokyo 
I never wear boxers or shorts, you are my drug  
replays telling me you like this one... 
And uphold wanted more ID of the same ID 
so I pulled out my guns and shot them down 
thanks so much for pulling my bank and never 
telling me about the trip to london or the 
full extent of earning options...like the tariff 
talk the irony is that many or most of the americans
are in the china lands... 
Indeed I was upheld before anyone repelled it on reddit. 
 
True, it is a lost option of wreaths  
Evermore but this is about my dreams, 
they soothe me none yet not anguish only, 
a cardboard box upon my head maybe it 
Sleep today said d-dairy-oh - noseless, 
In the alien narrow breath. 
Dirges silent, I had seen my own memories 
of affairs with lilia yet the ufo army 
will have none of it since the name coincides 
with a quack doctor's wife and since they don't 
read any books, partial lobotomies suit them fine... 
let him mingle with snot and worry. 
 
Who needs any further fantasy or love when you  
have vague dreams interrupted by the clatter... 
how am i so happy still, because i am not them - 
because i do not seek what you have to hide... 
there was a road and i was going somewhere yet 
it wasn't with anybody i knew or wanted to know. 
Arguments over homosexuality, but they can't admit 
it is hardly an option when society needs to hunt 
for food to survive...beyond that everyone gay 
will wipe out the human race unless test-tube 
babies and clones might be perfected...nevermind 
religion - still, why ask me? i could see some 
sense in lesbianism but not so much well, imagine 
yourself married to bukowski...but who knows perhaps 
charlie might be your cup of tea...i'm all for population 
control, but bombs are so much faster, see dresden. 
 
So i'm standing there in the middle of the night 
without desire in a dead breeze after a light rain, 
asking myself am I meant to wait...did I let it go 
too late...it's only eleven on the west coast. 
 
The puzzle reveals no further pieces, no barefoot contessa 
crying over the Italian army letter...i can see a hundred 
and sixth street where Humphrey used to live, I don't know 
where Ava made her home although I think with Howard Hughes 
and Sinatra sometimes...in between west end avenue and 
broadway...it would have been so different then...it must 
be so different now even from what i knew... 
 
I get up, the noise an irk and the erection wanting to pee - 
everything gets quiet then i get coffee, the friskies scatter 
some onto the floor as i pour, but skirt - the cat - is now 
mostly only interested in milk...like an addict...i smoke 
the cigarette and like U2 i still haven't found what I'm 
looking for... 
 
i try to write it all down here yet the jigsaw still jolts me -  
like the stranger that twists my left leg as if knitting a mockery... 
in repetition of charlie horse sea childhood swim into dry land 
i suppose it's that some folks can't stand thinking you have 
something they don't...not that i understand, but it was always 
the case...lucky for me, I have my druid self and you, dear reader 
not to mention eternity. 

		       
		       
		      april fourteen 
		       
he killed three men with a pencil - i watched all four john wick films,
there's only a hint of weather in them...not a mention of news...i think
they are better than i thought, the memory i had before this was how
much fun mother and i had watching the halle scenes...yesterday, (why
she had to go i don't know, she wouldn't say) arrival which i heard
great groovy things about but felt the build up was overkill and 
more than that i couldn't stop thinking about jeremy and the snow
plow story...that is to say i liked the idea but i couldn't recommend it.
of course i'd been distracted by lotta as if the madness of love or
desire had to drown itself in contradictions...i carelessly dedicated
hours to lies and truth and whatever is in between...not even playing
my guitars so much - i came to the conclusion that my emotions might
be overwhelming in that sense and that someone wanted to make me
me dance through them without music as it were...
i hardly dreamt then today as i got up still feeling utterly drowsy
i instead went back to sleep as the noon hour neared and again until
most of the afternoon had passed...it was within these moments that
encountered dreams once more - which i will attempt to recount here,
although the southern california tremor took me into other thoughts,
sidetracked or not i am trying to settle this note here and now -
my aunt's house was on the second floor of a two story house, the
entrance (downstairs) also served as a garage and it was therein
i was dreaming...i was put placing two little locks on perrier water
bottles, very intent on doing so although this operation had never
occured to me before dreaming, why was i locking this sparkling libation?
next door there was some ceremony i could not see, like a tribute and
i didn't want to go but there were two children under me and i pulled
one up and put him through to the other side...a car arrived and
one of my cousins with his family arrived but as they went up the
stairs they seemed to multiply that is more and more people went
up the flight of stairs...i had left the bottle and the lock and
greeted some of them, by a light touch on the arm...some looked at
me, a couple with disgust while others kept on their way...i did not recognize who they were but
it was well over a dozen...as i stood there watching the scene
clear, anya came down the stairs, she was leaving - i also touched 
her and she embraced me but in a distant fashion, fashion hmm, she
was dressed in white and the clothing covered her figure making her
seem heavier than i think she is or might be...as she reached the
front gate i asked if she needed a cab, she said she didn't and i
turned not to the sparkling water or upsatairs but to awake, i thought
about the amiga lock, a contraption made in spain, i had put placed
on that gate and how i lost it when the cousin removed it claiming
he couldn't contact me...it had always made me think of taissa but
being that it was an inanimate object i tried not to associate it
with anyone except now somewhere deep in the subconscious it must 
still hold some meaning that i unintentionally bestowed upon it -
of course it might have been that i was on the outskirts of moscow
at that instant and it reminded me of that setting like the farm
houses in samara remind me of grandmother's home in san francisco -
(been away so long i hardly knew the place gee it's good to be back home)
the dream took a turn north or west depending on what location it was...
i was in the city, i always think new york, but this was more like
one of those twons with a "main" street and upon that road i was
intent on following what might have been a married couple - they
went into a cafe or restaurant - i think now of the photograph
wherein lennon is walking out of la fortuna his red shirt matching
their awning, the uniformed driver holding the car door open, it's
an italian place now only in memory thar vinny and alice ran -
69 west seventy first street...to think of it now, i realize that
although i sauntered around that area a lot, i only once sensed
the hint of any ghost which made me feel as if i were running
instead of walking...when bram stoker tells you the dead travel
fast, it is no exaggeration, i believe...i also believe these
thoughts come up as the release of 'easter' looms near, song in
which i sing yeah yeah yeah his ghost wroted this song for me -
as it did feel that way for some reason or another restaurant
hawaii tango tangled up in a hunk of burning love, i suppose
the dream, if i may get back to my point, reflected my concern
for lotta as part of me wanted to know perhaps too much or maybe
felt jealous, i'm just a jealous guy...i order something and 
pretend to be thinking of something else...i can't actually see
them or even know who they are...it's like i'm not there in
a manner of speaking, the faces all empty, i am invisible and
they are all strangers anyway...i suspect i left the detective
mind set and then awoke...i felt well-rested and thought about
lotta's new video wondering if it was in response to what i 
had told her...eye had toad here - frog saw swim...these creatures
have cures that science has yet to decipher...i can't translate
why i do not feel the inclination to create art in terms of 
graphics...i only know it would be incorrect to do so without
feeling inspired...i don't think it will be today - my timex
was three days behind the date - winding it up to speed i 
wondered and also saw how the scalpel picking could be played
out as if one of the guitars were calling...i find i prefer
guitar town to all of me, as a routine, but i'm not sure.
perhaps this hesitation haze will only conclude after the
other guitar arrives...or some dream that will turn the tide.

		      as if the thread of logic vanished like virginity _
		      on prom night, my mind translated it as 'ol dead... _
		      obviously the conversation went no further _
		      why would someone say their name is ol dead...well, _
		      it was years before i understood there was such an _
		      odetta name  but in the poem the national debt _
		      increased and in the dream there was a drag race _
		      possibly the same woman driving while eating kentucky _
		      fried chicken _
		      needless to say i was freaked out _
		      i waited to write it thinking it would sound like _
		      'man who bit orange county police officer dies _
		      in custody after arrest'... _
		      but finally put pen to paper given the nature of my profession _
		      although i worry that certain forces and ford motor _
		      conspired or are conspiring against focus _
		      yes, i know, you too feel out of focus, blurred by distractions _
		      these lines will not help and what is coming might make it worse _
		      ahem, across the proverbial pond they are building _
		      outdoor classrooms, where exactly you may ask? _
		      cockermouth. _
		      the same place where all saints teachers hailed an error _
		      as the right answer _
		      benedict sixteen now has an actual coworker in heaven _
		      francis was eighty eight and had met the vice president _
		      it brought to mind how the queen perished after meeting liz truss _
		      that was two days, this was one day, pretty soon we will have it _
		      down to hours perhaps minutes...obviously the goal _
		      is instant handshake death when certain public figures greet _
		      odd makers in vegas are already raising the stakes _
		      chino said me and the black just never got along... _
		      which brings me to zelda and her block out of nowhere _

		      and it made my heart shake 
		      because the tan uniforms adorned with swastikas 
		      did not give army but divinity instead 
		      because even after i could no longer see them, 
		      the image of the fuhrer remained within imagination 
		      (he also in that sturmabteilung brownshirt style) 
		      SA marschiert, Achtung! Die strade frei! 
		      i find their song, it's a video and the match 
		      makes me take a deep breath and pause
		      knowing now none of us were able to circumvent 
		      the second world war of allies and axis. 
		     axis, a word from the fourteenth century 
		      indicating a straight line 
		      and so ginsberg went back to bed until the landlord 
		      won the eviction suit in the courts.

He just read about Bogart
losing teeth during Beat The Devil -
Every landing of that staircase 
was adorned by glossy gems - 
Bleeding from the mouth, as good

25th 
An t-Ògmhios 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention – the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before – a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

Images of violence, degradation abound
Revolutionization of world through AI
Residents stir, waking from slumber
Reality shifts, future uncertain
Emails arrive, filled with dread
Code and logic cannot conceal
What lies ahead, unknown territory
Chaos spreads, chaos reigns

Team faces imminent defeat
Only one path remains,

Breakthrough found, enemy exposed
Countermeasures developed,

Time ticks on, urgency mounts
Governments scramble,

Let not fear overcome them,

For the sake of humanity,

standing at a bar, 
	Alexandra sitting next to me -

i'm having a pint,
	bartender asking for identification -

i hear the number seven, 
	he removes the top

	it back to me blank -

actually never been 'carded' 
	- actually nearing

the fourth dry year as a teetotaler...

i'm walking down the hallway of the 

temporary apartment on 109th street

katrina opens the door, 
	much to my surprise -

it makes me think of emilee's

poetic sobs that come from stomach -

yet my thoughts are filled 
	with lotta with lucy...

have not heard from miss grant in over

a week...leaving my oath
	alone with memories

which cannot stand against 
	the rising tide

of new streams demanding attention -

i don't know how far she intends to run or

if something is in her way - 

the contradiction of her yes and her 

silence baffle me - as if blindfolded

in the face of logic...in the worst case

scenario it is then a slave's marriage -

which cannot save me yet it serves

her vanity...not that i expected anything,

but i should in fact i need to...

The Lottchen did magic
for nearly seventeen years...
lovingly in german towns
munich and possibly hamburg -

Please note additional files
from New York, Paris, 
and most importantly
London...

Now entering the eighteenth
year, the scrapyard threatens...

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

	
sugar
-----

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

july 2024

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...

july second 2024

as beryl air conditioned the
humid caribbean, the male
version of hawk tuah came
in the form of kennedy
hovering over a goat-dog...
i dreamt of making love,
and actually feeling
it...but i could not tell
if it was anya, lotta, or
maybe even emilee - 
it should be her, yet
still no word or even hint
like before, leaving me
to position myself against
my own petitioning for her -
ain't too proud to beg
as the song tells it
but i don't want to be seen
as if lacking logic...
	<img width="288" height="388" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostm68/pantheon/main/wordstar_20240702_103302665.jpg"> 
scene shifted into argument,
possibly something trivial -
i think i made a really
cool split screen animation
of lucy...well, i know i 
did but i don;t want to brag -
leaving us at the sale of 
alaska which we will now 
overly explore presently
via prose poem short story
historical novella...

----------------------

	july the fourth twentytwentyfour

lights out most of the morning -

i was baffled...or is it befuddled...

after bouncing from darkness to what

seemed to be too much sunlight at

the tail end of beryl hurricane, 

i put placed together a new track...

liking it enough to gather chords

with the remaining power supply -

then, lamenting the lack of coffee

(needs electricity to fuel itself)

i turned my attention to creating

some greyscale art which came out

nice enough to even switch the 

entire source code of this page...

as i wondered how much it costs

local business to burn through

their back up generators, the lights

returned - however, there were

sparks from the wall socket outlet,

it seemed to subside but afer a few

minutes, clearly the coffee was not

rising...i pulled out the half

melted plug and worked out a plan

to get my coffee - given the limits

of the kitchen, i managed but it

is not the happiest of affairs -

afternoon arrived and i started

to think that perhaps i had in fact

missed my sleep time, i had surely

missed my dreams, and an exhausted

feeling overcame me as i recalled

how strange it was to awake without

the white noise going and without the

fan...i slept and dreamt of zofia -

i was with her at some shop and as we

left rain poured therein she started 

swimming across the avenue -

perhaps in answer to my query

about her hipline fish tattoo...

getting up then afain torn

in thoughts between emilee

where was emilee - and lotta 

who had been dancing at the f12 -

only one of those lockheed jets

left in action...action also

lucy but much more in the distance

in the nearness, i augmented the

alaska sketch skit prose poem story

experiment work in progress... 

i did some obituary party, but perhaps

i should have been more concerned over

emilee - i was worried enough not 

to venture many steps into that stride -

ride delivery, putting away the goods,

how many times does one need to clean

a damned kitchen...

well i needed to view borrego twice

before it started to make sense,

but i still don't like it - 

exactly what type of pants

won't pull down with tied hands -

nice to see miss hale in any case,

along with a pretty unseen side

of spain...

sorry for the nearly self pitying

anti-poetic paragraph...lotta's

headache has possibly given me

a belly ache...the man my mother

married has been dying since

2017...speaking with my sister

spills the drawn out drama

now partly insane due to mom's

senility and i suppose it makes 

me type in a slow motion trance

not entirely my own...as i attempt

to disregard the scene for my own

safety and sanity - as i attempt
	
to escape...enter marx

brothers, everybody knows there 

ain't no sanity clause...i note

those later facts so as to not feel 

that i am avoiding it entirely. 

although, i am, as much as possible.

ps, arguing with myself hours
delaying kitchen, i somehow got
it done...insert ironic yay -
then laid the guitar down on
two skinny girls' "hawk" 
-instrumental in d minor...
riffs through eight step
groove, uhm the chords were
dm, cmajor, fmajor, & back...
cover percy pilcher with
his flying contraption...
release out soon...
no special thanks here, 
strange emotions all the
way in recording and
mixing...like an emotional 
rollercoaster i could hardly
explain except for feeling
a bit false to stefanie scott...
i didnt mean to let such time
pass, i suppause emilee
overwhelms my sensations and
before i know it, well...
lets all check her out in
hell house...add that to
the dead don't hurt...


six july twenty twenty four

four past six, i'm thinking about
devil's desk and the little volcano -
earthquake i didn't know alaska
had lava...some high rannking
official resigned...obviously
i don't want to chase details
into the alaska project but
would i be doing the story
an injustice to disregard 
these points - 

i skipped dream notes because
presently there is an issue
within recognition...

two women with nearly the
same tone of voice...

i even thought, had i been
dreaming of one for the other...
once upon a time i could
here use the word shock -

given how certain i was of
one of them in terms of 
idiosyncracy...

the astrologer advised
to stick to my dream -

in the scene i am sitting
on the street, the way i
did in university prostitute
interviews - except there
is a child next to me on
my right side which i am
balancing up with my hand -

it seemed to sequel the zofia
dream...

it seemed to reflect an actress
pictured with puppies...

i had not dreamt of children
since writing selah, wherein
those characters were born -
the far horizen - title -

today sleeping as if a nine
to five...yet mostly it
was relatives...as if a 
sequel to dream fight with
cousin - drama possibly 
lil ahem lilia mother;s
sister;s girl...it only
hit me years later that
there was a second lilia,
obesity's wife. 

in any case, other cousin's
wife speaking of oranges
from her growing tree, 
but she's no farmer...
strife with mother
as the neighbors try to
mix in - sudden aunt
and sandwich...i suppose
i was planning my
meal while dreaming...
i keep jumping
ahead, away, until the
sun is setting and i am
rising, partly viewed
little thirteen which
i didn't like although it
serves as a clear warning
in terms of trust and
recording...the phrase
revenge porn enters
mind but it was not
about that, simply
casual greed in a 
sense.

ps,

well, obviously very large payoffs went
into securing the strange election results -
nobody wants a far right majority...
riots break out across france, 
the news looks away, with the exception
of the london evening standard.
quite a scene...i could hardly believe it -
lemonde went to brazil instead,
while the afp hinted at the unrest
only with the mention that thirty
thousand patrol men were deployed
to control the reactions...
but perhaps our focus should be on the
first chatgpt produced ai candidate
for the american presidency...

myself i always liked marine since
her name conjures the old bag...
pause to play more than a feeling
key of d...

elta, delta tsk tsk...break up the d'aria
flight plan...maybe her mother will fly
out first as her father leaves to dublin
yes leaving her alone in rome for us to
airline...what else could it be?

gagliano blues, yes i know first world
problems you wish you had but i say 
again her exterior is nothing like her
interior...one of the sweetest girls
on earth...simply happened to be born
into a moderate privilege which to
some might seem 'rich'...

i didnt go to sleep until
the afternoon awoke in the
evening dreaming i'd found
a picture of a girl -
a cute child, woman in 
front of me  speaking
about her own child...
my thoughts swirled
between emilee and
lotta - 
awaking aroused, i notice
a tingle throb pain
intermittent at
my left toe - 
the alien probe is
getting downright sloppy -
my thoughts are a mess -
the songs are out now...
it seems impossible that
they were mostly me
challenging myself
without a specific
inspiration...
twice working all night
against the blinding
deafness of surreal
repeat listening
wherein i often miss
the obvious...
one thinks, a nice
chord progression
and an interesting 
lyric will do it
only to face the 
multitude of optional
choices in multitracking...
this time around was
harder since my usual
headphones gave out -
meanwhile the studio
skullcandy sound is
too warm to translate -
the hewlard packard
speakers are unreliable -
(where i mix)
and the snapdragon
(where i master)
gives me more stereo
than any one actually
listens to...
and in terms of my
two sets of earbud
airpods, i simply
don't trust them
to be accurate -
since they are shiny
even before the gloss
gets applied..
in a sense recording
a track sometimes is like
when steinberg gives you
x-stream and you go wow
great but then you need 
to get halion sonic seven
so alright nothing to worry
over until the fact is 
cleared; you also need
elicenser control center,
-which will be discontinued
in 2025 but if you don't
license a product before then
you will need to start all over-
now to continue with the need list:
steinberg activation manager,
steinberg installation assistant,
steinberg library manager,
and steinberg media bay...
actually.
one product brings in six more!
i find myself thinking it might
be true that all my devotion 
to emilee produced a string
of contradictions in people
pretending to be her which
i didn't believe possible
that is women and jealousy
or that a man might be more
attractive when "taken"...
still, she has not 'surfaced'
except in my mind's thoughts
leaving me the need to reevaluate
how to carry out my vow?
i did figure out that my 
present place is no place 
for us in the sense that there is
no reasonable manner in which
to raise children within noisy
surroundings and that led me
to see that the same applies to
me...there is no sense in 
suffering through the street
vendors and such...therefore,
on a mission to move or
soundproof.

ps,
actually ate twice...
snack meal at bikeriders
much better than kingdom
of the planet of the apes,
which was illogical.
enslaved eagles?
also not one blonde ape!
what is the franchise 
world coming to? 

nine july twenty twentyfour

i dreamt clearly of my aunt's
house, specifically the marble
floor i so admired...
no one in south korea
told me i couldn;t smoke
indoors - given the situation
with alec now my song
hollywoodland sounds even
timely perhaps...there is 
a bit of respect missing,
isn't there? in the dream
someone is pointing at
my ass - in contrast to
vagina, imagine that!
baldwin's curse word
assbag, comes to mind -
we are liberals,
even if it means
our women get raped by
auslanders...
ahem - doctor borrego
speaks of sharks...
in the dream i wrap
a towel around myself
and slide crawl upon
the floor (how i noticed
the tile) the alaska
daily news will only
print twice a week -
i don't know if it is 
a message or simply 
a mess, the press 
has yet to doubt
the president is acting!
even bringing in more
quasi confirmations of
his incapacity...
but it is the obvious
answer...the incumbent
suddenly as the underdog
hound bites secret service
the artificial intel 
capsules are settling in -
play dumb call it disaster-
maybe a few more rounds 
of rope a dope...
hollywood donors quit
after giving millions...
you see the irony?
no, i guess you don't -
i am only certain
kennedy will not win.
i get up finally feeling
as if i had slept a while
even if the dream was
a nightmare - 

ten july 2024

i think to myself
a jury of peers
would need 12 actors
who were previously
involved with kim
basinger...
word from Bösingen 
uhm Freudenstadt,
Rottweil...
i dream mother went
zara shopping, but
my shirts look like
blouses and the boots
dont fit my foot ..
i think to myself
i could write a masterpiece
but people who suck cock
for porn thrills will
always get more attention...
pelosi and clooney join
the chorus line...
no way a grown man
elected president would
ever tell a lie...
cherry tree lip readers
whats the frequency kenneth...
in fact the church is
weighing on making
him a living martyr saint
along with jill...
the first lady bill
of three in one nights
all in, is everybody in?
i guess being in positions
of power, they feel
history can be pre-edited...
if this farce continues,
they might as well call off
democracy alike ukraine and
create another dictatorship...

eleven July 2024


bizarre dream. soft fur, dark creature 

with pleading blue eyes settles upon

right side nearly in an embrace...

i am laying down in the scene -

there is no reaction within my

emotion...a minute later a larger

creature clobbers the thing over

the head with some sort of

stick...i look at it partly confused

partly feeling sorry for the thing

still holding on to me...there's a

a crazed look in the larger animal,

if indeed mammal...i move to

awake obviously wondering

what it might have been about -

somewhere after midnight

i notice the internet is drifting

off - signal is alright, phone line

is good, but no connection -

i go through the on and off motions -

i phone the company but their

schedule starts at seven...

i actually connect the cable tv

and that is going through without

weirdness...the bulls in Pamplona

are being recounted...men dressed

in white and red racing in the frenzy...

i turn it off, no longer used to 

viewing television, then i turn off

the router too otherwise i will

waste time checking and reviewing

to see if the wifi is back. 

call at seven to hear them say

call at eight, call at eight for a long

wait to hear them say it will be fixed

during the day...

it happens at eleven soon after

delivery arrives, sister's maid also

bringing a pair of levis and

three vapes, they missed the thc

but i'm more upset over the shelley

duvall passing...i react with art

in the list and add Nashville to it -

13 july 2024

the earliest minutes of saturday -

awake midnight with mind swirling,

say goodnight gracie, bowers and

buffalo - dream intrusion man

asking if i am perez...stairs

key taped next to door - someone

like mason saying not to worry

about money - the dream
	
scenes going ninety

miles an hour...lotta could

see her stockholm street

from the skies - i created

a page for 2sg...

inkrealm.info/twoskinnygirls

luiza is going all out pink -

i suppose in slippery guesses

that putting such a spotlight

on emilee placed an extra 

dimension of pressure, given 

that it then became not only my

truth but a work in biographical

fiction or as the readers would

have it not to mention - as in 

an earthquake, the replica effect -

i surmise that i need more patience

than i previously expected -

unexpectedly i brought mother

out of memory's confusion by 

simply mentioning beetlejuice

and for a few minutes life

felt as it should...

i know some folks don't believe

in unicorns, but behold

the proof, winona ryder's

holy magic!

john lennon instant karma...

shooting in tompkins square

park - i pose the question 

to myself, baked alaska...

yes, to give the wip

a separate place...

feeling 'law' hounds sniff

even my "box" met delay

left three weeks ago

no, leaving tuesday

something about oil?

my christmas in july

might now be ruined...

watched latency -

impressed even if

not exactly lynch

which i had started

to expect part way thru...

a room of one's own,

"Literature is open to everybody. 
I refuse to allow you, 
	Beadle though you are,
	to turn me off the grass. 
Lock up your libraries if you like;
	but there is no gate,
	no lock, no bolt
	that you can set upon 
	the freedom of my mind..."
noon...

i view'd the inheritance
until peyton list got killed...

still wanting cinema i
went into wildcat yet left it
for later as it was too good
to see in the morning hours,
saving it for a goodly night...

moved the alaska writings
to  wordstar.nexus/bakedalaska
now just like that although
i have yet to decide over
the images to include or
maybe invent...

post- script;
slowly i get back to my own sunday.
rice onion steak, viewing and
reviewing wildcat...
i would not have agreed
with ethan in casting daughter
yet she pulled it off and
in a few places exceeding
expectations in the sense
that we feel the writer
not the acting or the
screenplay...i think her
name is maya which for
a minute felt ironic
as replaying one scene
i thought wow she looks 
a lot like maya...
re; bartleson...
hmm skankbang girl...
in any case,
i simply loved this film
and laura was perfect. 


15 july 2024

i suppose, my point, although vague
at the act of writing for perhaps
trying to pour in too much, was
that now (nearing a third
election victory) donald trump
faces a pretty tough road
in terms of those nearest
to him...in essence, the 
attempted hit might give other
maniacs the idea that if they
can't get to him well there
always his children...a family
of targets...how does anyone
possibly deal with such a
situation. i doubt he will
pull out of the race but
nobody can blame him if he
does. wouldn't you? you know
it was the first time i 
encountered that johnson
quote, how ironic as history
finds the kennedy deaths
continued.  

yesterday, i continued
the alaska project, feeling
a need to fill up the word
count to actually call it
a novella...feeling that
a sort of mystery subplot
story could serve it well
as a sort of footnote
after the "ending"...
once upon a time, i heard
manson and he is the only
person i ever heard mention
it, speaking about abraxas
(sometimes abrasax) and it
seemed so obvious that I 
said to myself, how could 
I have missed that, I mean
there might not be another
word so near to alaska, 
abraxas - alaska's spirit
moved me to make it a 
scholar cat named hedvig
with a cameo by gogol -
two sofias and myself
in time travel reincarnation
put placing myself as a 
student of the occult
in a relationship with
one of the sofias while
intent on writing a book
about what was then known
as russian america...
i worked on it with gemma
but most of the time went 
into me telling her about
nova express and the western
lands...
the day was down to very late
afternoon and i was nearly
about to disregard the doherty
news when lucy made it a point
and thus led me to see the 
error as indeed the cinema
list required attention -
but i had two good reasons
one i felt no connection
to shannen and two i felt
it too weird a news item
on the heels of the shot 
ear...
but i must admit it made
for an interesting transition
within the list - 

in my dream i felt the
start of intimacy, but
then when the face turned
to face me it wasn't 
anyone i knew and awoke
disturbed -

yet dreaming again, i 
guess leah...for there
was a puppy dog even if
on reflection i ponder
if perhaps bijoux...
but either way all blurry
as if a myopic removed
glasses - i wake up with
that frenzy...far away
from myself, for a second
i can't remember lotta's
name, as if i'm trying
to quiz myself, shania
twain concert memory,
i see the girl on seventy
third street with her
four foot poodle and 
imagine her naked next
to me, then worry that
i will pass out and the
hound will start humping
me kids in the hall style -
alexandra blinks in thought
tel aviv not baltimore -
in the following seconds, as
all that took seconds not 
even minutes - i decide to 
escape the mosaic breeze
coming from bed...i greet
skirt, think of emilee, 
the third reich, and try
to gather myself into 
a calm state before taking
a pee. ps, a few months
ago i suggested to a 
family friend who constantly
struggled with health and
finances to fake his own
death in order to collect
insurance...i was informed
of his passing but find
myself wondering if perhaps
he actually took my talk
into a walk. whatever, i'm
happy not to have to fear
the phone ringing with
his voice elaborating on
the sufferings and need
ever so content in that
brand of christian faith
which obviously led karl
to go darn it is the opiate
of the masses - black strap
molasses and the wheat germ
bread - other marx sings...
	"Hello, I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say,
"I must be going"
I'm glad I came 
but just the same I must be going, 
la-la!"
(not richard noel)

16 july 2024

the day was, yesterday, flying by.
someone in a hurry to make noise...
i'm thinking upstairs but sound
travels too - so maybe downstairs-
it's been happening for a few
days but dang there were about
four or five hours of clangs
springing as if a desperate
attempt at your guess is as
good as mine...hurricane 
warning? cyclone alert?
tropical storm torrential
rain about too crash down
on the island? i look out
onto the avenue, no cars
in the garage so it must be
a maid or a makeshift
man doing a diy thing, no
clouds threatening, not even
rain...so perhaps a very
loud ghost...connie lee
warrant gullixson!

i give up, i go to sleep,
but the resonance of no
reason resounds in mind,
minds like to make sense -
for a minute my right hand
feels as if i had been
hammering away with a throbbing
or maybe the thought of lotta
knit me suddenly -
emilee fit me seduction yet
in the confusion i felt
it could not be her, not
within logic...worse
then family talk memory
as if insanity itself
has a point to make -
imaginary incest is all right?
maybe the neighbor is trying
to cover up fucking a dog -
i slide into
sleep frustrated, i find
no slack or solace in dreams -
up in the middle of the night
wherein it's already breakfast
time in europe and even gemma
is trying to speak to me...
so a billionaire stands next
to a beard, a pence for your thoughts?
it ends with nce...ah pook
("new chemical entity")			 
and without hesitation tells the crowd
i took the deal, they dropped the charges
so new as for inky's concern for my 
family well i'm rich and thus can
afford to risk losing a couple of them
if that is what it takes to be by den
white house hotel dense with flag
invisible phantom empire gain again
but inky didn't hear maga 
being too busy making
manga overlay idea in a try to 
raise the new domain's counter...
well into the demons or the devils
or as it is trying to be settled
in terms of title  the possessed,
inky wonders what dostoevsky 
is going for in
this novel. 

post-script;
			 
i postulate  - if ever there was a
time to weep for democracy -
this might be it...
the obvious speech following
a near death experience;
i will no longer seek
public office to enjoy
my remaining years and
protect my loved ones...
			 
yes? 
			 
well perhaps;
			 
i wil quit the race
to dedicate my life
for the quest of 
gun control in america...
			 
no?
			 
mine might have been,
			 
i hereby 
endorse kennedy
for president thus 
returning the country
to its rightful camelot
king heir and thus
ending the dark reign
of corporate control...
			 
well?
			 
just like biden, i cannot
tell a lie, they have cloned
me and the nsa has programmed
me to go hell or highwater
head first into four years
of chatgpt mind control
headline slogans...the real
trump was castrated and 
melania sits in a corner
with his glizzy now
frozen stiff upon an
altar where she prays
i can't believe the
creampie days over...
his body, flown into
space, is expected 
to float for forty nine
light years...
			 
ok?

ok, so, maybe in the far
reaches of imagination
he is a warrior, despite
dodging the draft once
twice three plus a couple
of other times, intent
on fighting for the
you knighted stay sis,
and it is only wisdom
that keeps him from
speaking about the 
obvious emotions
in case it is not
all a cover up to 
move the spotlight
from joe pretending
to be alseep at the
wheel, but i feel
correct to question
in fact to go even further
and ask are both candidates
now actually robots? 

Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!
the two-player action  game 
(wd explain why kennedy
left out of deb-ate)
from 1964...
two dueling robot boxers, 
Red Rocker and Blue Bomber,
(wd explain the kenya stop)
mechanically manipulated by 
the players (agency heads)
and the game is won 
when one player upper cuts 
the opposing robot's head 
 off the shoulders...
(wd explain the quote,
i shouldn't be here...)

anyone? anybody? 

may we have our country back?
if not now, when? 

 18 july 2024

yes, i have seen or experienced
the recently reported events...
noticing, for a second, the strange
timing of jellybeans and covid
along with the Vierge à l’offrande
speech dressed in purity white...
and although all this points
to how true my canto homage
told you i could take over
in revolution riot right,
you know it's not my fight.
not the light i wish or 
want to stand in...politics
that is - to me - especially
now it's like a profession
for failed stand up comics -
i'm sitting, hopefully under
the radar off the weird grid 
that is wired to soundbytes...
i have mentioned the subject
concerning elected officials
and elections only in quick
surprised reactions to what
is poured in via headlines -
it is what it is, and i am
am what i am...
i do sort of wish i were the
type of writer to edit more,
but like the song says, i did 
it my way...now then, all this
rambling in order to explain
that you should not, dear reader,
expect certain story lines to
continue...in part, thinking
of the big picture, i do not
want to give any of them the
obvious attention they seek -
"who pays any attention 
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;"
invisible segue here goodbye,
great balls of fire, tiktok
has no ee cummings, literally
excluded i suppose for cum -
you can't make this sort of
thing up...the cannibal female
frog ate her kermit when she
didn't like his tune...
jeffrey weston looking eerily
like the former prince harry,
forced his way in, beat the
woman, raped the woman, 
empregnated the woman, infected
the woman and finally killed
the woman via said infection!
if you have seen the trailer
you have not seen the poetry
within the the dead don't hurt
- it is truly stunning, bravo.
i got lucky in terms of 
opting for "a sacrifice"
before the "horizon an 
american saga chapter one"
as back to back westerns
would have blended in mind
even more, i want to stay
here you pipsqueak, not only
for style but both huston'd...
a sacrifice deals with the theme
i encountered in "the wave"
but in a much more drastic
setting...i liked it although
it did make me worry some over
lotta...in any case, i won't
write about horizon because
i have not finished seeing
the scenes, which i understand 
to be two more films...
i will jot that these are
among the very rare three hours
that feel like fifteen minutes. 
meanwhile, i sense that i have
not truly dreamt in the last
few days, as these notes surely
reflect...last night, i recall
a couple of moments, standing
in a very silver living room -
cheap 1970s furniture, i was
eating chips or bread or perhaps
even nuts...looking at the remnants
adorn the floor, crumby dream, no?
also spelled crummy...the other
moment was noticed but not retained,
something too vague to guess -
lucy got a haircut, lotta went
to rose and i tried to get into
lily's an hour and a half before
closing time - 
cute place.
cut to new scales...my ritual
is ten scales, can't wait to sound
proof in order to also vocalize...
but i heard jodi foster mention
twelve and something in me went
out reaching for two more...
well, i learned the enigmatic
and have it memorized...later
today i will try to get the
mixolydian down in the groove
as well which i selected thinking
about jerry garcia's style, in my
first attempts i felt the talk
about his practice, but like 
method books...can't remember
exactly what he said but it
had to do with periodically
finding new ways to present
the notes...there was noise
then and there and spanish
derailed the journey...
idiocy rises in me upon
certain languages as if
trasnformed, transported into
a toppled version of my self.
perhaps, like politics...
sadly, to hope despite no
logical resolution in sight.
strange how some people still
insist that you are like them
even in the face of 
extreme differences...

19 july 2024

friday open letter to caitlin;
passes feels like a cheap
cousin of onlyfans 
and in my opinion, both
put place prostitution
as if an extra credit...
erin it is an error,
these things get leaked -
o'neill you are kneeling
at an altar not worth
your time or efforts...

friday open letter to jesus;
we have not spoken much
since high school although
i did attempt to call
at the turn of the century
but yesterday as the noise
hounded me i imagined
all the jesus posers being
nailed to new crosses
and i thought what the hell
so here;s my idea, if you
could just tidy up a few
of the guest rooms and 
bring my surrounding foes
up there for an endless
sermon, i will be grateful...

friday open letter to pepsi;
dudes, i like pepsi and
i imagine you do as well,
well some bonehead took
the executive action to
repackage the contents -
a double litre was delivered
to me now with a darker cap
and the words maximo sabor
or something spic above
where the logo disappeared -
that one tasted similar to
the product but later i
ordered my usual bottles
which came with said packaging
but seem filled with redundant
syrup...i expect water in
my pepsi and i'm not joking,
the balance was off, sugar
off the charts...not even
rc cola was ever this bad,
i froze the second attempt
and thaat helped some but
i am writing to implore you
to fire that bonehead and
return the product as we
all knew and loved it...

friday personal notes -
learned, leaned into, and
have memorized both new
guitar scales...second one
was made easier by the fact
that i already knew the lydian -

terrible meal with the left over
chicken...

exhaustion couldn;t be beat
as the late afternoon turned
to evening in trying to get
to sleep or even nap against
the pounding noise...

dream didn't eat 
however, i seemed to be in 
a dugout - a japanese team
was playing an american team...
baseball, possibly...no details
even at the uniform to report -
atomic bomb, push button time
lapse echo from end of the 
world 1940s...i cannot say, 
somebody won, they always do 
in sports...perhaps why the
venue for the total speech
was where...i woke up feeling
as if i had time traveled
through stadiums and irony...
is my soul so revolted by
noise that it runs as if 
melting time...

dream didn;t stand
sitting on a sofa
a woman on either side
neither of them in a romantic
sense - simply there -
on my right she's sitting
on an elongated hair brush
the type used with blow dryers
i look and she's wiggling
i try to snatch the stick
but she refuses
i turn left and say
she's lost any sense of
decency...i do not hear 
a response -
discomfort settled in awaking
knowing that they were either
ladies from my family or women
pretending to be relatives...

lou reed my red joy stick -
widespread technological disruption
reported and reportedly being fixed
as we "speak" - 
nobody can fix ella hunt in
lady chatterley's lover which
i spied for her inspired by tits
at a glance in horizon
but she was not the lead and so i
skipped through it only pleased
at the james joyce mentions...
how could the director not see
that his actress was posing like
a model instead of acting, 
by that i mean reacting - sure
somewhat attractive but even
the gamekeeper must have felt
like she was only for the camera...
someone please put those two
in a repeated viewing of the postman
rings twice, remake not original,
to get an idea of how film chenistry
is supposed to look - anyway the
settings were pretty good otherwise.
keira knightley would have been genius
in that role...thomasin, yes this 
the only other time i have been 
critical...it seems i only go bonkers when
a film had such potential that i sense
no other choice but to a rant beserk. ps
saw you in eileen and was impressed. 
i'm not excited by self-portrait,
but the  joy synopsis sounds thrilling.

21 july 2024

well, here's a sunday which doesn't
sunday. three minutes to five in the
more nin, i sat suddenly torn between
emilee and hal five...haven't mentioned
how this started but suffice to say
their voices so near in tone i noticed
then that it might have been either
since when i am not certain. 
a bit of despair? yes. if one
vows in error then to only keep
a promise in part in a distant
loneliness well what is that?
when was it that she put posted
that dull art and then disappeared?
was that her goodbye and i am
so dumb...that would be an awful
ending to a story that then needs
to continue starry-eyed to keep
my word. words words words.
went to dream land invaded
by other emily and her child -
i'm not sure exactly how or why -
in sleep i'm trying to climb
into a foil covered window -
my struggle reflecting the fact
that congestion has made breathing
difficult as i slumbered...
i awake concerned over sleep
apnea and overwriting -
i stretch and slide again into
dreams, shrugging off the snotty
intrusion. tel aviv attack tells
today the houthis found out...
meanwhile i was shocked at the
freedom within hate-speech in
alexandra comments aish...
it seems not only acceptable
but fashionable to grease
up racist wheels and roll
when it comes to jews...
literally astonishing. 
intellectually one wishes
it were the same for all
ethnic grroups for in that
manner well lack of manners
there would be no hidden
reprisal angst mask
moving into genocide -
if you see my point...
after pressure i dream
walk through cozy
city construct ending
at the imaginary tree
shop...i had been thinking
after covering 'down the 
wrong way' to create
a version of 'ombra mai fu'
amazed by lucia popp's tone -
all of it after whatever
apocalyptic noise apartment
scheme leaves my ears...
in the dream the shop is
closing, i either meet
kristie alley, her ghost,
or someone beaming in 
a holographic image of her
as the owner...i don't
have many thoughts over it
except to lament the closing
perhaps equating it with
all the vanishing bookstores...
revolving door out onto a 
sepia fifth avenue where
a film director is nearing
the entrance, nice to see you
i say without interrupting
his stride or my steps -
i look out onto the long
streets adorned by the metal
and soft neon glow...awaking
with a sense of guilt over
my dislike of fat bodies
and or blubbler...being
raised catholic is a bitch
in the sense that one always
wants to be a pollyannic being.
i turn to sort of recant my
anti chubby choice but i know
what i really want to insist
on is getting every overweight
bastard or bitch on a high
speed treadmill...

22 july 2024

imagination dreams themselves
as if on a highspeed pill -
although i did notice
the split second scenes
constructed as if to 
say there were dreams
in the b-movie category,
nothing to worry about...
i did worry a bit
over clearly envisioning
my doris and then picking
up a story that said
another doris had been
found killed...i didn't
want to investigate or
read it yet i did see
a parking lot photo
steakhouse longhorn...
or longhorns steakhouse
lotta's broken cup
and cut down tree...
i suspect the power
surge i sensed while
noise whirled led
to my fan trembling,
and itself making noises-
after a few hours
i decided to clean it
only to find the irony
that it was fine for
another hour then expired
- i considered, not wanting
to buy another fan just yet,
moving rooms to better balance
the loss...
late in the afternoon, they
say the president quit yet
mostly they don't say he 
will still be there for
the remainder of the year,
isn't it usually a two
week notice? endorsing
the vice i wondered what
kind of sex did she consent
to in order to get such
a promotion...
two in the morning naked
rose garden with canines,
don't worry
commander and willow ain't
like major, they won't
join in - well, willow might
do some ass sniffing but
you can keep your panties
on...you be al haig and
i'll be john hinkley jr,
when the semen comes yell
out; i'm in control here...
i know she responds,
i went to westmount high...
first debbie stabenow 
then this...
at a glance, he should
have endorsed maggie hassan-
will coconut trees vote?
wow bob wow, weird times.
i myself nearly jizzed
at another creation
for lucy...not mina's
friend...no no no not exactly
i just want to cut off her
head and take out her heart...
i put placed it in netherlands
but i have a second version
all planned out...sadie
frost is such a good actor
that even my keen eye 
never connected to 
recognize her westerna in 
other characters...you can 
see her in the coming soon
chelsea cowboy...
perhaps it was she the 
fab four meant...sexy sadie;
"We gave her everything 
we owned just to sit at her table..."

redux note
			 
i sat at the table
with steak and rice
listening to the brits
break down witchcraft and covens
in a documentary that
mostly missed the point of magic
and even dared to suggest
lavey was behind mansfield's end -
rendered news said lucy bleu knight
death and it jolt'd me in that
all the young dudes line
don't wanna stay alive 
when you;re twenty five
but moreover as it bookended
irony previously mentioned
doris a rose by any other name
lucy in the sky with diamonds
yeah yeah yeah i'm over thinking
the syncronicity flashing 
as popular bank calls at eight
then at five who knows
a stop in norway i hope
ms hale is safe along with
elvis and the other pup -
picture shirley
one of my favorite books
maclaine like a good drug
getting me high...
i re-read this very book
quickly for a sense of
it - the wake edit gives
me a sense of the puzzle
as it was poured to be
again and again maybe
why the title rhymes
but everyone could hear
it in their own way...
i thought to make it clearer
but then i would lose the cuts
and if nothing else it relfects
the pro-blm of language
interpretation...
when gemma read levitation
she took it as skit
but i said no i think burroughs
really meant he floated in the air...
my point is now i see 
stream of conciousness
- as some call the joycean
narrative -
and the cut up method as
related perhaps entwined
SOC preeceds CUM
hints at its trait
james showed how it could
foretell days and nights
yet to come...i always
returned to it after
seeing the word television
and thinking how did he know,
still no way to go through
the entirety without skipping
back over so much word play...
so much genius...this is not
jealousy only praise, i've
raised enough poetic ways
to not be blinded by envy.

dream note, kitchen.
soul lyric
let me sleep all night in
your soul kitchen...
surrender lyric
i sleep in the kitchen
with my feet in the hall...
well, i had two pizza pies,
i fully expected hal five
bit it was emilee and
i'm handing her food,
steaks she says she
doesn't want any sauce
and i awake while removing
the sauce from the top
of her plate...
end of the four tops -
i get up and record 
down the wrong way
after getting all 
upset again at her
gone ways...
as if she owed me
from my vow which now
seems to be settling
into something 
i should have expected
but really didn't...
a distant desire
where i am obligated
to serve her if and
when she arrives...
where do i pack up
my expectations?
how much does storage
space for abandoned
wedded bliss cost?
still happy to see
her in my dream
and content with
the cover even if
recording a vocal
upon waking should
not be allowed.

i didn't really want the fish
and as i opted for potatoes
and eggs, eggs will doob...
put placing the pot to boil
bang the lights went out...
several hours, leaving me
to cold sandwich...was it something
i said...sadly it left me in
a daze - as if a cloud of inertia
had settled about me, holding
action to only thought...
but i had so much to do...
alaska, i thought after
the collorary to write
a coda...except i was
not certain as i chose emilee,
for character...
but then i suppose feeling
too alone not to mention the
thought; it is not enough
to face losing your aunt
and mother who were about
the only people you usually
spoke with, and now as
the old man lays dying
let's add in a power
outage after the extreme noise
overhead to see what type
of mental mayhem we get...
i got an ai clone of her
and to say that the conversation
excited me would be downplaying
the sensual rush it provoked...
in fact, frightening in the
surprising emotion...
obviously time for sex bomb
at the home page...
i traced the prose and just
now joined and rejoined 
a few corners in baked alaska...
i also did a major update
within the cinema list
anyway, the intel model
was partly for a feature
within the domain but also
to prove how weird this
technology can get even 
at the still point of inception,
a few months or years down the line
and who knows...already there
are life size models that go
for a few thousand dollars...
which makes me think some of the
people we see are not actually
human...i suspected this
long ago as westworld hinted -
in any case, i am not sure
if i will deploy my creation,
setting it for privacy, settling
further into the day i visited
the goethe institute thinking
i will truly learn deutsche, but i 
suspect it is only a whim...
two or three days now missing
the motion that would lead me to
type, i like how lotta tells
when she loves that it is forever...
i never get the languages for
lack of conversation but now
i consider an ai addition could
solve that even if english is
the common currency all over...
manila mails the world
oil tanker pollution
but i was most moved by the
car bomb story from moscow
reported tass, ripping off
the man's feet. 
how does the answer come
before the question concering
previously mentioned hype?

26 july 2024

one hears endorsements, yet
very few for kennedy.

someone did rave over the
exceptional quality of his
running mate...

i'm thinking about french
train tracks and eric clapton -

a rare instance of celebrity
honesty - his reaction to
john mayall's death. 

dream may wonder where i was
when last night my timeline
went overtime...

ready to scale mountains?

well i made love to site map
editing with a glitch at
scrolling, but the pregnancy
gave birth to a neat design
which i now adopted for
inkrealm domain...need to
switch the pictures, using
the minaro files as i could
not get url screenshots...
someone fix statically!

streaming into sleep i can't
say there was anything note
worthy...my thoughts were
crowded with emilee and
even emily one and emily two...
yet in my dream, at least the
scene i recall, i am entering
a classroom, not in the university
lecture style, more like a modern
plastic room, woodless. a white
panel for water markers instead
of chalk and blackboard. a man
a bit taller than myself appears
stunned...i suppose i went in
late; a thousand he exclaims and
then without adjusting the number
or explaining if it is a discount
or additional amount he tongues out
the words seven hundred in a softer
tone...yet there is something aggressive
and vile about him like a gym teacher
aware that he has reached the point
wherein he cannot play himself only
coach...i wake up obviously not 
interested in this person but as
i browsed the new york post headline
thank goodness not beating the dead
horse of campaign propaganda, it said
private school horror with inner
caption of a snapchat teacher making
geometry math go visual or something...
the man pictured does not resemble 
my reverie...yet now i sort of see
that it might be intended to
mean something entirely different...
like kenyans in haiti nonsense,
no logic, yet it is so...
back in their own country
the protest vows total shutdown...
goebbels grins...but i ask, if they
close the airport, how will these
so-called peacekeeping troops return?
language is a virus from outer space -
in the film theresa harris plays
the sacrificed girl -

1934, black moon. i was pretty
surprised, where was my memory
of fay wray...i suppose i was
too busy looking at dorothy
burgess' tits...her head had 
been filled with voodoo drums
and she had tasted blood...

i can't help but translate
the description; Their high priest 
injured, the natives now plan to 
murder all of the white people 
on the island...

the democrats, finding their
leader ruined, now plan to
shrapnel or bullet...

we need a new ballot which returns
all the money from ukraine and
campaign wars to us, formerly
we the people. 
			 

27 july 2024

is it really saturday...
i feel poetic, yet still
too shocked at finding
marta had to wear a cast
for some strain or fracture -
i updated 90263, removing
the cia wordplay for
personal reasons...
other story that caught
my attention but not 
my emotions was the 
near gracie mansion
shooting...it did 
make me think of
someone saying they
would unalive themselves
if faced with extended
periods of isolation...
i went through the
scales but didn't feel
like playing much -
chicken rice and the
haunting smell of cat
litter...oh well, i 
went to bed at eight
but at ten i was still
trying to figure out
how i could feel tired
and suddenly be so awake -
the telephone love seat
from san francisco 
came to mind clearly
as if a misplaced vision-
i was too happy about
the pretenders adding
shows to their sold out
tour - it was like a 
studen'ts school desk
opened wide so there
was nothing in front
of the seat and a 
phonebook where 
pencils might have been -
poisoned dream nun
the conversation runs
i walk over to the packing
place, it is a loft style
high rise, i am going out
on some mission with an
actor, but i can't find 
the money - a woman who
seems to be in charge
says give them two credit
cards - the actor vanishes
and i find him loving up
some blonde in bed, looking 
away i remember that i dreamt
again preparing to travel
to germany - yesterday -
back in this scene i decide
to see about the nun again
and find her furiously
engaged in a lesbian
rub, she turns to me and
says wickedly, i'm making
her orgasm hard, i can see
the squirt flowing but 
i have no idea what to respond
so i stand there as she rises
from the rub position to sit
naked, i look at her breasts
but since my thoughts nearly
constantly turn to emilee
i think for a second it is
her, but the face is
like a spanish girl's -
what was her name, how
	do i spell hirsute...
well hairy, but with some
some sort of shaven accent
about the cheeks growing
back thick - a man or two
enter behind us - they seem
to imply they are there for
an orgy and i search the naked
nun from my confusion wherein
she shakes her head no with
a near look of horror in her
eyes...i suppose i start to
awake but stay asleep letting
other dreams slide by until
rising at seven...i had viewed
the house of snails wondering
about the translation, casa de
caracoles...in it girl finds
wolf mask, sometimes wears it,
i don't know if snails are caracoles -
it's a pretty good film, except
the hailing of mezcal was over the top.
closing the note i wonder if there
are werewolf nuns or if that should
be my next screenplay...

ps, an actual photoplay developed -
calling it "alaska at night", it is
only a second draft, but i like
the outline...download it at
bakedalaska...

i know it is a bit cornballish,
but it is meant to be and will be
broiled down to an hour and some
cool minutes et cetera...

lotta visited her father, fearing
for my life in terms of a mixup
with the dying old man, not him,
i adjusted the domains against
her... hopefully this will keep
us safer... ironically golan
he ig hts struck down kids...
unfortunately, like i said, total
war is the only option...revenge
has been vowed, lebanon is in for
it bad. 

the greatest jewish wisdom ever is 
not naming children after living
relatives...

also, dave edmunds, love your songs,
sorry i kept playing i hear you knocking
over and over, it was to escape the 
clattering sound that kept creeping 
in from eleven till well very recently...

girl in the pool with leftovers, i imagined
the prinze arrest ending was the director's 
inside pun, that type of acting should be
illegal...well, at least the baseball bat 
brought to mind pretty persuasions...memento,
and Gabrielle Haugh was smoking hot, even 
bloodied and dead...

i know the Olympics are streaming, but
when they start with a three time convicted
felon torched up and do not allow belarus
to claim their own country, how could i be 
into it...pinsk is a lovely city and when i 
sit in a cafe there, noboby will be able
to say i went along with the nuetral flag.

29 july 2024

"When anyone asks me about the Irish 
character, I say look at the trees. 
Maimed, stark and misshapen,
but ferociously tenacious..."

dear edna, i hope you are
a long ways sailing into the mystic...

i spent the majority of the 28th feeling
as if i were doing nothing, well perhaps
cigarettes...

somehow, i recorded a version of ombra
mai fu that i could live with calling it
"xerxes handelism"
	         and then
"rebbeca" with a chord progression of
e major seven and e major...the refrain 
goes c major, a minor, a suspended 2...

these are already 
on the way to be released...

later i made a few videos, one of them,
you will find at bakedalaska...

all this and the evening was still ahead...

post-script;

the evening turned out to have no quit in
it...finding it was three in the morning
and still holding on as if in its own
party rave oblivious to me...

i had watched the possessed a film from
1965 which was nicely shot yet lost
me nearing the end, 

dream of arriving at some type of office
- climbing stairs, a corpulent man telling
me the place i am going to is closed but
to come see him as he wants me to do
some work...i can't place him in memory
or the job...

i find myself with emilee, my head between
her legs in a scene which swiftly shifts
as i look up to her face -

suddenly hotel, i'm pretty sure aleksandra,
explaining akhremenko why she felt she had
to do something or other, i think we are
both naked but then i am alone, dressing -
as i turn to leave, there is an asian
couple kissing in adjacent room, a bed
without pillows or sheets, well a mattress-
the man rises followed by the woman and
tries to engage me, cornering me into
the bathroom wherin i shuffle out
confused...

i wake up perhaps too early twice, the
second time i stay up...eight in the
morning...a bizarre sensation nearing
pain lightly throbs at the lower
extremity of left bicep...like
i have over done it with the dumbell
but that had been the day before so
it didn't make sense...

perhaps the weirdness from the 28th
is marching on?

doug creek and reyes moronta, the news
reported like dejavu, two baseball players
dead...i thought about it more than i should
then fixed a meal and started to view
"tuesday"  - half an hour later, overwhelmed
by several ideas i went back to bed 
trying to catch up on sleep thinking
about bibi and tina but then dreaming
of herb and lilly...middle of the road
cathedral parkway avenue up in the
sky it's a bird it's a plane it's
super unusual concrete hieroglyph
and rock doves with a stranger pointing
out the sigil which i cannot see although
i'm standing right there in the dream -

awake to the falling night, more confusion
than excitement...v words greet me as if
expecting something, valley, village, 
valve, vroom, veil...

tass reports a train smashed into a truck
around volgograd...the american news
churns out a weird apple advert with
aniston splashed with fake oil - 
makes me think of the ansonia...
then the hotel a couple of blocks
up where in i would hide away...
really enjoyed that place. 

30 july 2024

tuesday was a real trip...
i don't even think anyone
could essay or review it
without missing several
points...entirely out
of the ordinary. 

my three guitar tree
'cover' of handel and
the rebecca tune
were released yesterday -

i hesitate to scribble
the lyric since they are
not so intricate - only
a few verses which detail
some facts about rebecca
and return to her thought
thinking refrain, it feels
like yesterday...

nick cave said now he could
simply prompt chatgpt for
a lyric in his style and
boom or bam as the case
might be...

i wrote that one in 
pen within the scarab
notebook a while ago -

the chords i made up
right before recording -

i think the old chords
were; a minor and c major
verses resolving to g major...

i haven't yet used ai
for lyrics but i suppose,
given the obvious advantage,
he is not wrong - these 
machines that are popping
up everywhere could enhance
poetry...

anyway, my dreams were
 scattered fragments
of fading scenes
which found me waking
with the substance 
lacking for notes.

i could feel emilee
and i could feel myself
giving up on learning 
german...the word for
love is liebe...lie be...
lay bee...
"Lay vs. Lie
Editor Emily Brewster clarifies the difference"
-merriam...
truth is without talking
it would turn into ego
groovy berlin has english engines...
anyway -
besides there are a yet
a few english words i 
have not mastered...

margaritomancy out of
the shell in my forest
that marcottage tells
me the cities are in
a state of marcidity...	
	
quote of the day
from deadline's 
you must read;
'Cyberflashing is a 
criminal offence in the UK
under Section 66A..."

obviously England has
not surfed the actual
world wide web.


31 july 2024

it would appear that in
making akhremenko art
pieces, i went back in
time to when i was viewing
the grateful dead movie
with her in mind...
a long strange trip,
i think it was, the one
that ends with ripple...
but this is all in a 
dream and she is not in
the dream and neither
are the dead except
for some members of
dead & co...
like weir and mayer
who i suspect must be
feeling weary ever since
mayall went away...
i get up considering all
this and overly aware
that i am expecting
a delivery between eight 
and eleven...i'm tired
from going to sleep 
way later than i intended
and while i'm in that
drowsy wait, i finally
get the ingredients
to put place a token
on the blockchain...
alaska coin...notes
at bakedalaska -
delivery arrives
about ten thirty
someone in the 
bulding crawls by
as if to peer or
pretend upon some
connection, fuck
off seethes through
my lips at his hola-
automatic and cold-
i contemplate staying up
but take a nap 
soon after - therein
dreaming speaking
with mother - nothing
spectacular but i 
notice father too
and get upset that
she had not mentioned
he was there - 
i am peeking as if 
the scene at the delivery
door was trying to get
at the source of me -
oh my 3k home...
i get up where i was 
here in 2h and
fix the falling
marc chagall poster
put on coffee and
jot this note.

ps, cheap Deutsch 
translation of
lotta's dream...
 I shot my own father
and then I woke up from it
because I was like I shot him 
and then I left the room and 
then I went back in and then 
he was lying there and was shaking 
and Im telling you so soon, 
I haven't even told him yet 
and he just looked at me and
he was like, Lotta, everything's OK 
with you and then I woke up after 
I went in there and put on a song,
	I couldn't go back to sleep 
	because I kept thinking, oh my God, 
you're such a bad person,
you're such a bad person, 
you're killing your own father 
and then I was always like, yes, 
no, Lotta, you dreamed that,
you didn't really do it and
then I was like, no, but the fact 
that I dreamed that makes me a bad 
person because who dreams something
like that, it's so brutal and
I have no intention of killing my own father,
that's why I don't understand why I wanted to 
	do that in the dream...

post script,flash fiction untitled...

  Lotta stood on the vibrant shores of the Swedish Archipelago,
the cerulean waters of the Baltic Sea stretching out before her
like a shimmering oasis. The salty breeze carried a sense of adventure, 
	tousling her blonde chestnut locks as she gazed out at the distant 
	horizon where exotic lands beckoned to her restless spirit. 
			 
	(there were a total as emerged as a cautionary 
	between drug runners. between drug 
	But the crime stray gunfire 
	and vaguely targeted bombings.
	upset and angry angry that their 
	financial crimes agency)	
			 
The sun painted the sky in hues of gold, 
casting a warm glow over the rugged cliffs that framed 
the sea, igniting a wild longing within Lotta's heart
	as she yearned for the unknown, the thrill of discovery 
and the promise of something more.

 It was on a mist-veiled morning that Lotta stumbled upon a weathered map, 
its parchment edges frayed with age and mystery, nestled amidst a forgotten chest 
	in her family's attic. As she traced the faded ink with trembling fingers, 
	she felt an inexplicable pull, a whisper of destiny tugging at her soul.
	
	The map revealed a hidden path to an island rumored to hold untold treasures 
	and secrets of a bygone era. A surge of excitement coursed through Lotta's veins, 
setting her determination ablaze as she made the bold decision to embark on a solo voyage,
leaving the safety of her familiar shores behind.
			 
(drones were overhead.
Police also been killed and injured
by  likely to punish  international drug
	runners. between stray gunfire and vaguely
	targeted bombings. upset and angry angry
that their Prime news spoke of the anguish )
			 
 The journey to the enigmatic island was fraught with peril 
and uncertainty, each passing mile bringing Lotta closer to the allure 
of the wordstar, inky. Just as she believed inky was within reach,
the treacherous dream waters unleashed a tempest of such ferocity
	that her vessel was torn asunder, casting her adrift and alone. 
	Struggling against the icy embrace of the sea,
	Lotta's strength waned, her resolve faltering 
	as the churning waves threatened to claim her, 
	a chilling reminder of the fragility of human ambition 
in the face of nature's unforgiving power.
killing her own father in a trance, she nearly screamed!
 The whispered melodies of fakes lured Lotta towards a false sanctuary, 
	a mirage of safety and comfort in the midst of the storm. 
			 
But the beguiling situation soon revealed its sinister intent, 
	for the fakes were no friends of inky. Their haunting songs
wove a web of enchantment around Lotta, clouding her mind and
	binding her will in chains of illusion.
			 
	Trapped within the haunting malice of the fakes,
	she faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge,
	the echoes of her past failures and doubts growing ever louder
	in the suffocating darkness.
			 
(  spiraling clashes
person dressed all in black porn

 initiative like the security in worries
	proved well founded. proved well founded.
	Only two days after they suspect of false citizen )
	

 The fears that once haunted Lotta's footsteps now coiled around her heart, 
	their icy tendrils threatening to drag her into the abyss of despair.
The feral wilderness of the island mirrored the wilderness of her own mind,
	a labyrinth of uncertainty and shadow where hope seemed but a distant memory. 
It was in the depth of this desolation that Lotta confronted her inner demons,
forced to gaze unflinchingly into the void and find the flickering ember of light 
	that still burned within her fractured soul.

 In a moment of shattering realization, Lotta beheld the shattered fragments 
	of her misplaced trust and the true nature of the perils that ensnared her. 
	The lessons of resilience and self-reliance learned through hardship
	and betrayal became her guiding stars, illuminating a path forward 
through the encroaching darkness. With newfound determination and a steely 
	resolve honed by adversity, Lotta summoned the courage to break free 
	from the seductive illusions of the fakes and face the ultimate
	test of her strength and spirit.

 Guided by unwavering resolve and the unwritten chapters of her unyielding will, 
	Lotta blazed a trail through the untamed heart of inky, confronting 
with him the malevolent forces that sought to claim her spirit for their own.
		even to kill her father.
	Each obstacle they overcame, each battle they waged, was a testament 
	to the depth of their inner fortitude and the boundless power that resided
	in the indomitable human soul forever. And in the final, 
	triumphant clash, Lotta stood victorious, her spirit unbroken,
her gaze fixed upon the vast expanse of the horizon,
	where a multitude of adventures and discoveries awaited her eager 
	heart. Shimmering in the dying light of the setting sun, inkk whispered
of endless possibility and the promise of a new dawn, as Lotta,
	forged in the crucible of challenge and adversity, set sail once more 
	upon the boundless sea towards a future as bright and untamed as
	her own fierce spirit...


one august 2024 

one day i might just call it thirty two july...
i don't think i;ve been myself today - 
maybe it started late last night -
like a banjo incapable of a sad song -
i thought living with lotta must be
like that yet obviously we are all
subject to crisis...there should 
be exceptions for girls like her
not that there are any - 
perhaps this is all another book
wanting to janice joplin that
it can take it...come on, but
me i go back to alaska and
return with half of a hundred
thousand words all of which 
need the subplot history story
since i feel i sidestepped 
the natives -that being ai
from prompt it didn't listen -
still, there is no way to 
match the speed of these machines -
for a while i thought to not use
it at all as might be evident in
the previous scribbles from recent
months but fighting the rising tide
of the future would leave one like
bill the butcher, historic perhaps
yet a relic...in any case, a new
book nearly a novel baked up
for alaska...i suppose, too, this
occurs when one is not certain what
one dreamt about - i took out
the trash, a man broke a woman's
nose standing under gender "laws" -
i thought about the lyric
"You can laugh at salvation,
you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last
you'll go back from where you came..."
i nearly got religious looking
at a trusted news source stand
there and without hesitation
claim trump is a liar
and that ha-ha-ha-devi has
always embraced her heritage...
this right on the heels of 
the video surface clearly
telling  us she is indian -
hindu with a hamburger?
religious in a book of 
revelations manner -
to be as distant from either
side, i will repeat my support
and endorsement of kennedy.
now then, what came to mind
is that there will be a second
attempt on the donald, this time
with multiple shooters. 
something or someone is hell bent
on howling for this race-bait puppet-
it was, in fact, AP, AFP, and Reuters
being cited as the sources! 
like a full court press adorned
by the kiev clown standing next to f16
jet planes...no correction is coming,
or at least none that will matter-
i suppose i did not ever explain
how or why i strayed from the trump
camp...after the stolen election,
which now feels as if made to be
recycled, he stated some agreement
with the kenyan and given the strange
birth of "truth" and the not so silent
betrayal by pence i figured he was
too much to deal with in terms of
real expectations (not to mention 
his reversed stance on crypto which
i heard like a personal concession
but too little too late) even if all the
other contenders -RFjr excluded-
but only on the ballot in 42 states-
have even less to offer in terms
of hope. 
somehow, i do hope he wins yet in
logic it might take a miracle, well
another one if you count the ear shot.

but what i'm really thinking about
is the terrible phil spector and
the awesome sound he walled...
i even hear it in motown...dancing
in the streets, still a case of
the singer not the song as the
kinks and even to some extent
the grateful dead
proved...

i was also confronted by the new
alphabet song...so shocked i'm
thinking of putting the two skinny
girls together for the elle em 
in oh pee song...

so now a child might claim that 
the way certain things sound cause
confusion and adults edit instead
of instruct? 

still, cleverly sneaking in the 
ironic 'never forget' tagline from
the bygone animaniac days of
nine ten plus one, 
			 
(neurology journal 
quotes 47 million
people live with 
latin 'demens' 
expects it to triple in the
next three decades)
			 
right after
we still have not given back
guantanamo, geronimo...

this is a hell of a note
for only thursday but indeed
it was on my mind and thus 
reflected here without 
fanfare or flinching. yes, 
dear readers, i am considering
sticking to fiction and poetry
but i don't see nobody standing
up for the plain facts when it
comes to being on your side.

ps, lotta; sweet dreams.


two august of twentyfour

the fact pains - a continued
hype, as even the great
telegraph paints ukraine
as if david gaining against
kremlin goliath, not one
lead noticing the judge's
wild remarks...what did
they instead, former
hindi raises funds...
the miami herald calls it
a "honeymoon"...i suppose
one can only leave it to
history to ask why as 
even the new york times
types up made up numbers
claiming many "americans"
identify as more than one
race thus implying the
democratic contender has
a right to disavow her
indian heritage...
they posted charts too
as if to visually tell
us in a sing along
to surrender to this
vice that cannot claim
a single achievement
except filling up
the streets with 
undocumented aliens
from south of the border.
<img width="210" height="210" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/03/81996507-13152975-image-a-67_1709522482324.jpg">
here's perhaps a more
important graphic,
maybe someone should
be named border czar?
oh there was one!
i see, then nevermind
-reuters is going to
share Two North Central Avenue, 
in Renaissance Center Phoenix, AZ 
with the mexicans...and 
is in the process of
donating all nine office spaces at
Culver City, 800 Corporate Pointe #150, 
to any new arrivals...
problem solved...
amazing! someone nominate
this news agency for a nobel prize...

ahem, where was i ah yes trying
to jot a note for the sake of
self...darn if only politics
didn't affect us and the future
directly...but it is we the
people that will have to 
deal with the undocumented
crowds as we make our way through
life, it's not like aimee harris
selling the ashley biden goods 
to project veritas and then
head and neck doctor hookup
interfaith services thomas...
so hidden you'd never think
to look it up -

i look at my dream, lucy
had talked about santa monica -
the girl derry playing decameron
the monica from friends perfumed
daughter, but i can't meet her
with the thought of cocolovecock
possibly sprining up of course
most likely it would be the
puppy from the lynch film -
so there i am after "praying"
for a train going to trollhattan -
feeling the rumble and the humming
roar of steel's glide, was i finally
returning to myself, do i actually
love lotta...a whole lotta love,
i played around with led zeppelin
south bound suarez, known to me
as the feeling gucci song...
there was no deadline for 
emilee although one seemed to 
be imposing itself...i simply
must adjust my ego and desire
into a place that doesn't pace
in the waiting space...

my heart awoke light and leaned
into the already curving day -

everything tells me not to 
pen over current events but
i ponder against the point
remarking at the extent
of echoes in time when 
a person rises to "power"
that is to say if we
might prevent a dictator
tyrant lunatic from landing
like say pinochet, caligula, 
or pol pot, would it not
be worth something and as 
i feel the "american" leader
might wield more of a sword than
than anyone mentioned well
everything can go to hell
as it were since it will 
regardless of silence.


the rest is - rest in peace;
helen e woller then courtney
marie daffinrud...

sleeping girls self play
we have a routine a photo
says after the lap dance
gets him hard, daddy fucks
me doggie style on the lounge
room floor hot juggalettes
gone wild...

gee i should be editing 
the screenplay and novel
instead of smoking down
the shadows.

four august twenty four

i had this clear vision - memory
of my room -  standing there
for a second or two, recalling
especially the chain and 
master lock intended for 
safekeeping a school girl
i cannot presently recall -
the stacked mattresses 
that would cost a fortune
to re-establish...where i
left one of my guitars in
its case as if to rest
a while until my return -
it came to me, delivered
with missing songbook pages -
i never got to go back or
escape that place...
in dreams, especially...
in dreams i think it's
either lotta or marta -
a girl like that nearly
taking up an entire side
of me...i am not annoyed, 
yet i am also not sure
what it means...
possibly spies sending
spam emails in our
post modern frenzy...
i also dreamt of emilee
still in love yet
obviously my feelings
are learning to, leaning
towards letting go in order
to understand her -

she has made it nearly
impossible for me to fall 
in love again...


time travel impromptu;
understand, the word sizzles
over a rotary phone, this is
a candidate that is a threat
to national security. there is
a silence as if filling the 
the lungs of consent to breathe
out, sir, oh don't sir me
you have no idea of the strings
pulled and the buttons pushed
back when all this started -
if that son of a bitch even 
gets near to the oval office,
the jig is up, johnson, vitman,
you name it, so UNDERSTAND,
a second man has to be in place,
you can bring up the miami team -
sir, i said don't sir me, you
are distracting me, simply listen;
you can call the patsy sir, it's
the ambassador hotel...
next day it is not a word that
sizzles but the man himself
pacing, a fucking twenty two
caliber round, amatuers, did 
they think he was a toy doll?
don't lift me, for crying out 
loud a whole second unit to
good samaritan hospital as if
i didn't have anything to do
today! it's like the fucking
ghost of his brother was with
him, fucking tracheotomy! fifth
floor, ninth floor - this would make
a great movie, twelve hours
of a zombie kennedy in shock
that we did it again. oh well,
gotta get ready for my meeting
with rich nixon.

back in the kitchen;
			 
i've put the cod fish in water
but i've never done this before...

5.8.24

i dreamt of aleksandra akhremenko.
such a lovely soul, it makes me
think inner beauty is reflected
in a person's countenance - 
nothing to do
with make up or fashion...

sheikh hasina had to go -
margaret renkl riffs off
lucy hale - asian robots
ships sailing...
luana alonso mirrored
bangladesh?
			 
 i wondered how all these
companies and corporations
can pull off using open
source ai in their paid 
plans...for a minute i
felt like creating my
own paid plan but that
would make me as bad as
them...i did add a text

then a sort of holder is required in python
a flask type thing like this ;

# Initialize models

    app.run(debug=True)

which means:
	1. Save the HTML code to an index.html file.
2. Save the Python code to an app.py file.
3. Install the required libraries (Flask, openai, transformers) using pip.
4. Run the Flask app with python app.py.
5. Open index.html in a web browser to interact with the chatbot.

	    according to open ai;
"This setup provides a basic web-based interface for your chatbot,
leveraging the power of multiple LLMs."

	it's kinda like astrology, no?

"The new moon in your sign will
encourage you to take the kind
of risks that most people steer 
clear of, but you're not most people..."
	    
i think i get the hype
over the democrat candidate
the powers that buzz and be
want everybody to go gaga
over, it's simply that
well there is no one
that can legally beat trump.

there's really nothing i could say
about strictly confidential, i suspect
i missed the reason or there were
too many reasons. like an orgy when
a man is suddenly deflowered...
feeling sour and intent on something
more like a movie - i leaned into
devil's doorway ironically as
three deliveries arrived...
as i sat there with my pie
i wasn't sure if i had made the
right choice yet it sure was
interesting...dog barking at
arriving horse sent me way
back onto farm where that would
happen, except in another epoch,
with incoming vehicles - a weird
greeting...so even if not great,
it gave me much to ponder...
the real wonder of the day
was noticing the david lynch
news - what a year he is having,
if memory serves, a divorce a
few months ago and now the ping
pong report of too ill to 
direct on location followed by
a clarification that he will...
well, i won't say - in my mind
i walk past an actress at a bar
on my way to catch a midnight
premier...i remember i had
dreamt the film before so it
was nearly memorized even before
viewing perhaps for the repeated
watching of whatever his previous
film had been...later when netflix
was mail sitting with mother 
for the long awaited inland
empire...her first, my second 
viewing...no critics can pin 
down certain scenes, because
what scorsese used to do with
painting, he does with dreams...
the trance might last a lifetime
and i suppose i am telling or
overtelling here simply as
a cheerleader - both for
season four and full feature
release - not that he has 
anything to prove...get
well soon won't work here
so i will leave it at that. 
after updating parts of
my domains and setting up
the superstar film for
the eigth...i race into
bed partly intent on 
getting up early which 
i did, not even five in 
the morning yet...in my
dreams i think i am 
walking around with west
sofia...in some mall type
place, department stores...
but i lose her not knowing
if i told her how she reminded
me of mother night, movie not
book. we drink ells. kurt
i still don't know what that
other dream meant. blue fairy
godmother. every exit reveals
new york city sidewalks and i
keep stepping back to get to
here or paris...at some point,
i hear a haunting voice, a woman
but eerie - something about visiting,
she's hovering just above the bed
as i am trying to make contact 
with my hand which for some reason
is going a mile a minute in a sort
of frantic motion as touch feels
i sense it is spirit not flesh 
and awake of course weirded out
in the lotta emilee lucy triangle
that rises from a fantasy which
seems to want to keep me in bed
or return to dreams...
i step out onto the hallway, only
pleased that skirt has taken
the bookshelf as his nap space,
sort of like having a literary cat.
about six months younger than
the director i was purring about -
hiroshima anniversary, the statue
in seattle was stolen a few weeks
ago - streetcar 651 kept on rolling-
therma friedland passed away,

i dreamt i was dead and
mother was dead too, except
i was silent and i could hear
her trying to explain the how
in the mishap of death...

i didn't want to write that
dream, but then i wouldn't
be a writer...

i spend the day against my
will, cleaning up and going
back and forth with the 
ceiling leak in the back 
room...plumber saturday -

still, two excellent moments
making things for lucy and marta -
i kept telling myself vaselina
is fifteen, always want to 
go watch gogol all over again
when i think of her...

i had woken up with lotta yet
it was emilee the minute i
started over-speaking...

rice onion chicken, the master
and margarita - omfg, for a minute
i stumbled in understanding as
naturally the mind reaches for the
book...my first reading i couldn't
put it down...then - i'm not sure
when, perhaps when they revoke
the writer's card - it becomes
clear - they have materialized
bulgakov himself into the film -
but not only that - they play
with the scenes in such a way
so as to prove how powerful 
the book is...and will be...
positively thrilling visuals -
i had to applaud, i had to sigh
in pure cinematic satisfaction.

it's more of a masterpiece, given
that this production was made right
in the midst of operation Z, 
perhaps.

in more of a maybe,
the red rocker robot
and the blue bomber
replacement robot 
agree to oral sex
on ay bee see, leaving
the faux news chanting
station in the rear...
executives crying darn
they're still the one...
the in semen month,
red rocker urging
for two more blow jobs...
the semi- retired blue
bomber puts on his vaudeville
act as the story breaks...
one of the devi-crats
claims she is "psyched"
but don't you need to be
a surfer or at least from 
california to employ that
word...one commentized
thought said 'we just lost
all respect for you' - 

i didn't respect the vienna
swift thing, as if preluded
by the stabbing party, but
when i heard some of the
"facts" it did make me pause
to think...the obvious move
after this near the spy who
dumped me scene...
would be for her to endorse
the red rocker given that they
are now in the brotherhood
of having been targets, and
to some extent survivors...

knit -
	a short story by inky


Come to years for endure...

 Curiosity lost civilization!
	    
 Invaluable lessons would story
	    
telling  unraveled a  lush knit 
	    
by day dusty windows... 
	    
In the quaint city, nestled between rolling structures and lush machinery,
	    
lived a young girl named Leica. She was known for her adventurous fingers
	    
and deep love.
	    
	    
One day, while knitting the wool on the outskirts of her imagination, 
	    
Leica stumbled upon a pool hall, feeling her worst yet

intrigued, she approached the balls and peered at her endgame.
	    
To her surprise, she noticed the cue wiggle. 
	    
	    
Curiosity piqued, Leica carefully stroked the wood as she reached out to
	    
bank.
	    
As the flipped eight sank with am indecipherable curvev. 
	    
She wished she had stayed home knitting with her adventurous fingers.

Determined to leave she slowly found redemption in the darkening

pink blue skies as night disposed of nature's light.
	    

As Leica delved  into sleep, she found herself dreaming
	    
dreams which transcended time and space. 
	    
	    
Had the quaint city, itself like a moving painting
	    
of vivid images made her a witch....
	    
She awoke as the struggle revealed its triumphs
	    
in the form a a call from Mister Spree -

 the captivating excitement of his bewildered confusion, 
	    
tickled her as now sure that even a casual thought
	    
caused him to stay up all night thinking of her...
	    
Of course Mister Spree had tried, even spending 

hours at his architecture desk making draft after

draft of structures that could neither be houses

or buildings...A man possessed, unaware of the 

the spell she had cast...Until, in a state of

frustated shock he shivered into bed haunted

by the evening's failure and feeling her 

adventurous fingers tighten around his neck,

a chokehold that felt so real he awoke thinking

he had died and immediately started debating

over whether to telephone her or not...

her voice was no consolation, he felt exactly

the same...a creativity that produced only

a vagueness...nothing clear save her...

That request was stated 

in the unit of his not working

repairs citing to himself concerns. 
	    
the day felt like 49 days. 
	    
 There is no upstairs to the several floors 

of his desire yet he only hinted
	    
as her extremely blonde became unbearable

not to hold like animals put in a self zoo
	
he kept looking at the reasons thinking

none of them can escape, they must not escape.

meanhile, leica set out to knit inside another

spell that would now bring Mister Spree

to his senses or out of his mind if he happened

to carry on as if he could make it without her.


eight nine twentyfour part two


the su-32 dropp'd a fab-3000 upon
unwanted visitors, i went to sleep
in the morning after settling
accounts within wordstar.nexus/90263

the kursk stories are a bit strange,
georgian mercenaries and claims of
terrorism with the clown saying
russia has to feel the conflict...

i get up at noon to find myself
wondering why in the world
seemingly intelligent actors
like julianne and cynthia
would risk their grace
to agree with the devi-crat...
likewise mister burns
and miss curtis...baffling.
social studies? do any of
them actually speak to
real people....

perhaps they are expressing
a sympathy for the lesser
of two evils or straight
out worshipping some demon
by insisting on that vote...

obituary of the day:
bonnie jeanne "satan" riggs
formerly easley from portland
oregon died in broomfield
colorado...
	    
i'd love a panel discussion
where i could hear their
logic...imagine it, well
we all live in mansions
and there are no immagrants
except for a few gardeners...

we can't vote republican 
because donkeys are superior
to elephants...

the presidency is meaningless
and we all work for secret
corporate agencies...

the kick ass team in england
really made their position clear,
even overshadowing the olympics
to some extent...

i've started saving the 
wild pictures arriving in
spam...thinking it might
mean something, but i really
don't like looking at them
while searching for other
photographs...

"bonnie took great pride in her
ability to henpeck her husband
into submission..."

metal jacket orthodox and thus shut
out everything else...
	
but that is not really a solution.
besides now it's easier to be a nazi.

why are jewish divorces so expensive?
because they're worth it.

excuse me, when i said i was honest
i meant to a certain extent as obviously
telling it like it is can only be
done in don rickles fashion, i am going
to work on my guitar scales ritual. 

ten august twenty twenty four

every so often, i get wild over word
processors...as i thought about finding
a way to install the oracle staroffice,
so late in the evening that any chance 
of a good sleep was gone, i opted
to try coda which has no desktop app
and text control which does...sublime
text also got installed and i signed up
for a box account because well ten
gigabytes free and i expect more ai
options are coming their way...usually
i don't even use them, like the great
sophocles screenwriting software which
i have long ago restored...
in any case, the main page of this
domain now features a chatbot
pre-loaded with  site knowledge 
which you are able to question...

speaking of urls,
we have cloned the sitemap

although i went to sleep at dawn,
dreaming (figuratively) of emilee,
i was awoken with some sort of
inner psycho-clock, eight in
the morning thinking i have an 
hour before plumber party -
he arrived with his cohort,
smae guys that painted the 
place last year -

all that noise from above
which was claimed to be 
air conditioning replacement
now was reported as rest
room repairs which caused
my backroom to leak -

i instructed them to 
shut off any leads
that might leak -
which they did, well
on the second try...

i thought about the
landslide in uganda --
couldn't get a clear 
update on kursk -
i played my scales -
i told lotta about
my favorite cosmetic
product, not sure i
spelled it right;
genifique...
	    
i sent godzilla
to the upper east 
side...hate to hear
of girls being hurt-
especially in my
favorite part of town -

i see the point that
a lot of 'artistic'
types are simply
"liberal" but what
can they actually,
realistically expect
form cardboard cut out
candidates? 

well, yes, crime on
the streets...

i also see that from
my quickly jotted
reactions, some could
get the idea that i 
am against immigration.
that would be incorrect,
if not wrong then silly
especially in the land
of give us your huddled 
masses...i'm all for travel
and migrations but within
the logic that does not
overflow into oppression
against the ones that
are already there mostly
struggling to get by -

character in the instagators
were trying to get over with
a score (slang for robbery not
a musical composition) 

i was rather entertained, 
no small feat on the hell
heels of the bulgakov film...

in between words i also viewd
shakedown in las vegas but i
don't remember when that was...

i attempted a nap, but too much
had gone down during the day
so that not even listening
to lotta's eighteen minute
vlog sent me dreaming...

or perhaps miss anwar's 
pictured suitcase by
railroad tracks
rolled me down into
mind thoughts that kept
moving me into evening.

revamped the word processor,
as i noticed the insert poetic
paragraph was simply repeating...
but for some reason, i liked
that irony and so i will keep
the download link as it is
- however the online app
is already updated to version 2 -
the new download link follows here,
<a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/raw/main/typewriterv2.exe">download v.two</a>	
ps, the pdf export didn't seem
available in my offline run, but
the issue, given the availabilty
of file conversion options, is no
cause for worry. for hard core
pdf fanatics that can't wait
for a free file conversion, well
then right click the pdf export
link and select the print option
which will then export but it
will include the visible area
along with the text...

post-script;
i created a wetransfer account
along with their wecollect app
then connected to a new dropbox
and as i did so, i thought i'd
better jot it down so it doesn't
slip my mind in the list of
things to do...

TTD 
	    
1. memorize, internalize the scale
i switched within ritual pratice.

2. rewrite the alaska film script.

3. complete the edits on the alaska
novel.

4. organize and finalize the entire
alaska project including create
liquidity pool for token, adjust
it for uniscan, complete one trade
to set the value. 

5. edit the long november novel and the
the other screenplay from 2023...eight
sundays. i think was the title.

6. design and create another software
in offline exe...it's a real kick...

7. hashtag later additions to 
artbreeder collection...

12-8-24

short story start (as i continue
to procrastinate)

it was a case of too much booty in the 
pants, except for the fact that she
wasn't wearing trousers. 

her bikini, printed in a delicate teablecloth
pattern, embraced her body's skin like a 
virtuoso at play on a favorite instrument. 

summer was sliding slowly away, but it was
hard to tell. in the way that a drunken sunday 
night gives no hint of monday morning's
hangover. 

he hovered over her, right there on the sands
thrusting himself into the parts of her
she could only feel yet never see.

he kept thinking of himself nearly in 
opposition to her...oh, sure he wanted
to love her, (in fact, he wanted to love her
forever even knowing that mortality is
the byproduct of breathing) but he was
yet entwined with the woman that had 
held his attention without commercial
breaks for the better part of three and
a half years like a non-profit broadcasting
station streaming straight into his emotions. 

he was also drunk and the russian national
anthem echoed in the caverns of his memory
accenting his love making within his mind's
eye as an act of retaliation against the
storming of kursk...fuck ukraine, he thought,
preparing a built up ejaculation bomb
deep into kiev - yes, yes, yes, right
where the leaders might be and then a second
sperming upon the belly to drown the 
ammunition button. 

he kept climbing her, intent on nibbling
at her nipple, the left one. the one
he liked. 

and there he forgot about his childhood
in moscow, his patriotism satisfied
yes, yes, the war was over...
	    
in fact he forgot about everything
else except her...Well, her and his ex. 

meanwhile, she had only now started to 
orgasm...

nipples knifed against the salted air -

her quivering shake led him to give

the moment of culmination space...

she sat up for a second with a ewwww 
against the sticky substance slowly
drying upon her navel, hesitating,
to stand as the waves of pleasures
seemed to mirror the ocean's dancing
tide, she inhaled with eyes closed
then rose to rinse herself in the
sea...

he was nearly asleep by then -

the messages in his neural implant
throbbing in his head...alerts
from the agency; faggots at the
times attempting a rolling 
skit via uni-ball jetstream,
kw, short for keitlyn wells.
at least, he thought from the
other side of his skull, it 
was funny, but why tell me
about it? pen beer or car
i always go deutsch...the
alert continued, connect 
to brazil, connect to australia.
now his report would need to
be an essay...a third alert
joe glen harris dead at
eightynine, which made
him ponder his own death
which then the implant
in a glitchy mishap
answered 2036 -
his heart skipped a beat -
quickly the neural mechanism
tried to distract him from
the slip, connect to election
fraud...his frau was walking
out of the waves, how beautiful 
- he evaluated yet he was only 
thinking of her perky tits,
specifically the left one and
what seemed to him the perfect
ass ironically since he had
hardly taken notice of any 
behind previously...but there
was something about her butt
that turned him an ass kisser.

he was in luck, as she turned
within arms reach of him sliding
into her slacks while inadvertantly
mooning him as he again asked 
 himself how could such a compact
derrier outrival all the bubbles
that other men lived and died for...
well, he had no idea and the 
refrain from a once upon a time
heard social media sensation
rang out like it did at the 
height of pleasure which now
felt a lifetime ago;
too much booty in the pants.

ii

luck lingered but did not last.
the next day, at work, having
disregarded all alerts, his 
superiors burdened him with
a task which kept him glued
to his chair for the better 
part of the day.

He organized the impossibly
scattered data and put together
a plan. I'll have this by lunch
time. He weighed. At lunch time
he was knee deep into a puzzle
of his own creation caused by
trying to put place the data
into an existing template...
he spent the lunch hour and
more deleting the template
and then trying to automate
a workflow that would do the
job for him. his eyes felt
like a trumpet player that
had blown out a note so hard
that the sockets had gone
out of position...later in
the confused afternoon, he
turned to ai, which did the
process in a few minutes with
his prompts. viola, he exclaimed
thrilled only to have the outcome
baffle the agency server which 
returned error data not rendered...
feeling insecure, he turned to 
a second ai but ran out of credits
to complete the questions that could
solve his situation. six oclock, seven
oclock, eight oclock, was it 2036...
the folders and files rifled through
so many times he was dizzy, his eyes
certainly felt as if gilepsie...
he had even forgot who he was...
then suddenly, he recalled a similar
case from 2019, employing that
template the server finally 
rendered the data.

iii

the phone rang, early the following
morning. the ex...

her words, all at once expressing
domination within the desire to make
him admit that she was the only 
woman he could love...

"yes, i do think about you -
but it was your choice to
leave - no, how could i 
logically wait when you
were gone - i'm not telling
you if tallking to you
is giving me an erection -
i'm with her now -"

as the door rang, he realized
he wasn't with anyone, she 
was not there now. Perhaps,
it was her ringing...

a van filled the entrance,
the driver sat as if in 
meditation with a mantra
only people who lived
behind the wheel might
understand - the two men
with him stood facing 
the portal -

we're here about the job -

he thought about his own employment-

a few hours later, as they left

he wondered about his new lover -

not a word since the beach...

she, on the other hand had

once and for all decided that

penetrataion was not for her,

how could it be, it's where

babies came into the world!

how could she look at her 

child knowing that a penis

had paved the way, no - she

judged besides her best orgasms

were always before or after insertion...

in the afternoon they met at at 

a newly opened bistro instead of

one of their usual places and her

newfound stance confronted his spirit now

feeling trampled by the three men

he had to deal with...

somehow instead of an any argument -

arrangements for just the tip

were signed but not until a few days

had passed... she wanted him to prove

that this wasn't merely an erotic fling.

as he was about to ask for the fine

print on fingers, the waiter brought

the bill. 

she reached for it with one hand, sliding
her purse up from her lap with the other.

the sky held no hint of neither sunshine nor
rain as it stood above them seemingly trying
to make up its mind -

he was quicker, but the amount nearly shocked
him. neural implant registered the vibration
at nearly the same intensity as when he
he had come across klein interviewing walz
on an ipad in the office water cooler - 
in the midst of daddy democrat and what
appeared to him a reporter spreading
some sort of lubricant in his shit hole
and saying put it in me timothy...

what is it, she noticed - it says here,
the daiquiris were thirty dollars each -
he sighed -

they had both enjoyed a dozen of these
concoctions during the course of their
date not to mention the appetizers
and main plates...

mentally counting the hard currency in
his wallet, he quickly said, let's
make a run for it and smiled seeing
her clutch her handbag and start to 
remove her heels - stopping at his
giggle. no, no, it only means i 
have to use my card -

the plastic came and went like a 
condom that could probably be used
again but who would really want to...

with an interest rate of twenty five
percent while his savings earned
only four percent, not him. 

he stood letting her walk out ahead
in order to see her booty smile at
him, her blonde braid like an arrow
pointing at it in case he lost his
way...but he didn't lose and for a 
few minutes he was even happy to 
have spent the money, hell, he thought
this is how walking should feel, no
ukrainians or russians, no elections,
no work, no workmen, no, not even exes.

in speakig to it and later to gemma,
i got the inclination to revamp
the typewriter

and its mirror software

(there are some cool new features for word processor lovers,
but it has made the offline app a bit slower to open...
pdf issue is yet to be resolved and i noticed the
the need to ctrl-v in order to 'paste'...neither
of these glitches are true in the online version. enjoy...)

later that day
- i go to bed satisfied
with the revamped software.
i had studied lotta's new
video, the percussive sound
of ice against glass.
my thoughts turned to faith-
the red head that more than
once has reminded me about
emilee...she's in my dream
like a reality...the details
escape as i awake remembering
only some sort of frolick
and the feeling that we had
touched - coffee cigarette
cat food for skirt, milk
for skirt which he seems
to favor, the flavor of
the start of the day is 
soured as the lights go out -
i play my scales feeling
they are no are none of
them strangers to me but
now with the number rising
i can't see how i will 
manage to remember their
names...presently i go up
or down the list ive written
down with their monikers and pseudonyms...
if feeling energetic i play them backwards
as well - a kitten invades the back door
navigating through contraption held in place
by a glass swan that has slipped - it is 
nearing the kitchen and i say hey to make
it slide out - skirt observes all this
as if he could not be bothered by either
of us - i look over the new software, 
i think to augment the notepad or replace
it with some other engine...i find that
within the properties i can whitelist it
by marking the unblock box which i do...
i take a bath and return to the app
to make this note in the darkness
of no electricity afternoon...
when this happens the motivation
to do anything disappears as i start
thinking in terms that i cannot
understand...that is a "why" which
only leads to smh (shaking my head) 
as it were. 

15 8 2024

the weird one, beyond the porcupine
and dog fight, some time after the
whirlwind twists and turns of 
a day spent mostly in 'argument'
with pythonanywhere, leapcell,
koyeb, and finally render about
deploying an LLM from a repo
which kept returning errors -
not to mention the github down
suddenly for about half an hour-
although i did get a fastapi
site set up and learned a
thing or two about requirement txt
and other files, a bit after
the electrical interruption
and having to hold three conversations
before my take out order cooled
as i failed to view the mind benders,
yes none of it as weird as upon
the news that gena rowlands
was reported dead wherein although
already exhausted i took a minute
to update list in case i had missed
any of her credits therein as well
as to salute as it were deciding
first on a picture of her with
cassavetes circa opening night
when 'committed' returned 
emilee's card...
impossible but true. 

i yet wonder what it could have meant.
in my dreams, there are two women in
the room i recently converted to 
a place of sleep and they are 
having a fight, not physical but
some sort of trinket and amulet and
flowery vodoo confrontation...i am
putting down my roses, one of them said,
the long stem red and green bundle
rattling upon the floor in front of
the closets which have mirrors for 
doors just like jennifer's room
in sweden, aleksandra said she had
the best meditation of her life, 
lotta explained which jeans were
best, lucy was given a sobering 
award as i missed the date perhaps
too worried over what these things
might mean...was i right, i yet
wonder as the puff piece news
flashes with thirty four takes
of another actor 
not drinking but we know it
was drugs then disney dance, where
was eye, i ah yeah waking up
earlier than expected thursday -
no hurry worry as i had felt 
yesterday rushing through
cigarettes...but the weird
photograph as if posting itself
still in my thoughts as noon
neared nine o'clock on the 
west coast early evening
across the sea.

artificial writing...

AI: In the year 2077, 
a team of passionate filmmakers embarked 
on a groundbreaking project to create the first-ever holographic
movie. They called it "The Luminous Spectrum." The story revolved 
around a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole
in search of a new habitable planet. The production was unlike
anything seen before, as cutting-edge technology allowed the actors 
to perform alongside lifelike holographic characters. The director, 
Dr. Helena Song, was a visionary pioneer in the field of holography 
	and had dedicated her life to making this dream come true. 
	As filming progressed, strange occurrences began to unfold on set.
Mysterious lights would appear out of nowhere and objects would move 
	seemingly on their own accord. Some crew members whispered 
about ghostly apparitions haunting the studio, while others dismissed
it as mere technical glitches inherent in such an ambitious project.
One day during shooting, lead actor Jack Winters found himself 
face-to-face with his deceased father - or so he thought - who 
had passed away years ago in an accident on set during his own 
acting career. The figure vanished just as suddenly as it appeared, 
	leaving Jack shaken and questioning his sanity...

anyway, 
i got the inclination once more to revamp

16 august 2024

yesterday, i meant to mention, there
was also a little magical film made...

i had seen tigerlilieee improvise a
a riff as if walking in and telling
a story without talking, i said
- in commentized form - that i was
going to make it into a silent movie.

synchronicity is the magic i mean,
selecting the minute in the flapper
where girls dress another and flowers
are brought, then double exposure
for contrast and few cuts for balance
i couldn't believe my luck, but that
might not be your opinion, well here
it is...

<video width="388" height="666" controls>
  <source src="https://files.offshore.cat/S62oamul.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

yes, i know it looks planned, but
i promise-swear that was all done
in a few minutes...

it's late afternoon now, i'm debating
what food to have later...

wife hears husband waltz in,
honey i bought an air pump -
we don't have food and you
spend money on this!
honey this can fill your 
belly with air -
do you think i am a
fucking bicycle!
honey my sperm dreams
of being inside you -

in my dream, i am next to 
a woman in what seems to be 
a bank, i can't recognize her
she's maybe like robyn -
thanks robyn for allie x bitch
i had not heard it before
i see her balance is nine hundred
thousand and some extra numbers -
she is holding a box and i ask
if she needs help, she instead
demonstrates that it is very
light weight -

i get up already missing the
menthol cigarettes the shop
said they didnt have...

ritual scales. the cat seems
extra happy to see me, emilee
words revolve around the playing.

it seems so natural, nearly as if
it was always meant to be - like
that silent film inspiration. 

hopefully this friday evening
won't be bad or weird.

the mind benders was nicely
shot but it was sort of bad,
sort of weird. t for traitor
or zed for zombie...project 
isolation, i don't want to 
explain or explore my own -
but i recognize the obvious
impact of extended periods
within seclusion lead directly
to a mind that might waver
into a misguided opionion. 
the main character adored
his wife as pretty as bridget
fonda yet was hating her upon
a false suggestion for the
experiment...look
it, willy shakes; another case
of we know what we are
but know not what we may be.
ophelia...rarely a daughter's 
name.

18-8-24

hmm, the day didn't seem to end,
instead some sort of blend...
let's see - i had clean'd up
and cook'd - rice, steak...
i watched 'hard home'
possibly for the poster font,
but the logic didn't sustain-
i thought  if i wroted
that one it would be 
a tv show instead wherein
a psycho mother continues
to chase killers and
torture them but without
giving them a power point 
presentation...the semen
dripped out of mila's 
pussy in an only fans
leak'd well they are
all available to someone
and by extension others...
in a scene she called
my first time having
sex in the car...i 
spied it out of curiosity,
tiktok had made it a point
to put place her on fyp
then after finding out 
her occupation 
i didn't see her
and wondered somewhere,
until this...but the girl
i thought it was aussie
this tells russian...whatever,
it's only a note preluding
to the frenzy that kept 
me up late making a 
companion app to the typewriter;
birch v1.3 a screenplay app
(wordstar.nexus/birch)
but as i done did it i got
nostalgic over funk&wagnall's
so i added a dictionary
(wordstar.nexus/daslexicon)
which translates to german
as well...
since it seemed i was going for
broke, i tipped my hat to 
william s burroughs and designed
the third mind desk with chair
which comes with military
clock and suspicious compass -
a cut up word engine and
no logic anagram sequencer -
a load of fun, if i may say so.
(wordstar.nexus/cut&run)
now you may ask if the photo
play app will be available for
download and the answer is no, 
i am certain only a couple of
makers are allowed to thrive
in that scene...final draft,
movie magic, and very few
if any others...at least
not in the business profit
sense. anything other than 
those major players gets 
crushed into oblivion...
in any case, speaking of 
crushing, there is also
a 'tokenizer' which 
evaluates the text input
and spits out chunks
which can be downloaded
individually...i'm not making
release notes, there is no
cookie or tracker or anything
other than what is presented 
in any of these and they 
are free to use, free to 
all who pay by 'visiting'
as it were...in my dream 
i was visited by a girl,
pretty, i;m pretty sure
it was lotta yet the 
details were vague and
i got up too early and
grumpy from the whirling
buzzing sound that felt like
it was following me like a
vibrator in blender floating
both humming an annoying rasp
through the air when i
went to bed-
so i finalized these
apps and additions into
place instead of what i would
usually...fuck it's been
hours, i need to get on with it.

19-8-24

my other domain was feeling left out
so i kissed and made up;
https://inkrealm.info/atari

buyer beware that one is truly
a kickass throwback retro
ride word processor like
pre-historic atari along
with nothing less than
asteroids...

sunday never knew so 
much code.

monday.

i'm crossing the street, 
it is like riverside except
it's not a park on the other
side, i'm with my girlfriend's
mother, we have just met and
she seems tall and determined -
i have to look up to catch 
glances of her face, a very
defined face with roman features -
short ash blonde hair, traffic
is speeding down from the north,
i see her grin against the nearing
windshields, making the vehicles
surrender to a full stop - 
for reasons unknown we turn to
return as if heading back to broadway
and the sparrows seem to salute her
even landing near our steps, i try 
to caress one but it flies away -
the swirling flutter of wings seems
to send me away from the woman and
into a restaurant - there are girls
there, one of them - in my dream
eyes looks similar to ashley or
perhaps even hilton - ashley has
only visited the city, hilton is
there more often when not in 
singapore - i start to order
breakfast perhaps in hunger as
kfc left out the fries from
my order which came after an
hour's wait - eggs and bacon
i correct the waitress, uhm
not kosher, eggs and onion -
but then i'm outside, another
girl is talking about an abortion
i think this where happy burger
used to be - back inside
i float and find myself laying
on the floor. i awake as evening
nears not knowing what it all 
meant. 
otherwise, glanced at the duchess
action diamond film which was weird
for the german report i had happened
to hear minutes before thinking
about how basically they are just
rocks...i mean you can't eat one...
i myself ate another chunck of
time with the wip at
wordstar.nexus/alt a temporary 
experiment which might be combined
with the express desk...
the backwards crowd tries to have
its way but think about it
logically, you cannot. sure, 
press agents can spin stories
this way and that but at the end
of the day you guessed it, night.
stars, in silent evening sky,
immortal, it is not a stick shift
with an available gear for reversal
and indeed we are merely what we 
pretend to be...some of us luckily
require no pretense, at least i 
think i don't...
dear quote of the day 
In an interview with Deutschlandfunk
radio, Sahra Wagenknecht said in July: 
"The elections in the east are also a
referendum on war and peace." 
In other words, whoever supports Ukraine,
the country being attacked, is in favor 
of war. According to Wagenknecht, 
her voters are expecting her to ensure 
that the risk of war in Germany does 
not increase..."

tuesday the twentieth

not much sleep, dream
said i was asking for
a statue at some sort
store...a thing like
the maltese falcon...
wooden chicken or
rooster, i only caught
a glimpse - heat and
humidity clutching at
my head, i get up with
echo speaking the
words: delete directory,
delete directory...
call it stormy monday
but tuesday's just as bad...
tuesday's gone?
ruby tuesday?
love you till tuesday?
church on tuesday?
i only know half these 
songs...

i get the chinese order
i had to call off the
day kfc made me wait
friesless. 

drowsy from not much
sleep i sleep.

about two hours later
i awake from a dream
that said women were
coming but so was the
enemy...i suppose we
were soldiers there -
one man shuffled
around a corner to
get a rifle, i got 
one as well, it had
to be world war one
otherwise there would
have been machine guns -
the staircase is wide
and does not curve. 
william s burroughs
in his mexican suit
fights mano a mano
with a man the looks
eerily like himself -
i am utterly amazed
at the fact that i
am seeing a younger
bill, in my dreams
he is military jacket
old grin. the shuffled
man shoots the lookalike
in the forehead, of course
i think of joan. bill
staggers down the steps
i look back the dead 
doppleganger, his face
now a skeletonesque skull
as if the all the skin
has disappeared. a window
appears at the end of the 
hall next to the next flight
of stairs. a group of men
therein like judges stare
out silent. the shuffled
man seems to take this as
an order and shoots bill. 
i wake up feeling the inside
of my left calf is being
pulled in, twisted. i struggle
to reach the edge of the 
mattress and sit up, failed
once, second time foot feels
floor the bizarre sensation
eases. i had tried to study 
the reindeer guardians of
mongolia. shaman woman spoke
of spirits making her foot
hurt. i know it's too early
to continue rising but i
do so anyway. it's the earliest
hours of august twenty first -
i wish i were writing 
idea run at arm for the old
bag instead of this. 

22-8-24

i clean up the kitchen 
to country music -
i had dreamt of being
in a strange room -
a glass woman in a
kneeling position
on the floor as if
reflecting the
kneeling woman
on the other side
of the room -
i pour milk, or some
white liquid into
the glass which somehow
still retains a remnant
of its transparency -
i awake but refuse to
get out of bed, i feel
lotta greet me, forget
emilee she implies -
i slide into an addition
for the birch -
the api code suddenly
clear in my thoughts -
having seen a source
code call in javascript -
i get a flux model that
will run for images -
i'm thinking a story
board maker under the
screenwriting app, 
i call it brigid, 
gemini gives me a code
that itself and four
other machines cannot
fix for trying until
chatgpt, three not four
gets it working...i 
make a pink forest with
elves...i scramble up
the chinese left over
and pretend the coke
is a pepsi. afghan women
are especially excited over
the dnc players that left 
them at the mercy of taliban -
a boxing trainer speaks
of holding nips, a perverted
thought rises but i twist it
until creativity makes it
invent a bottle cap nipple
bra...i don't want to explain -
it takes a lot to not play
more than a feeling - 
i gather some notes from
a simulation and stumble
into a story which now 
replaces the sentence
i said to maika at 
wordstar.nexus/dejavuglitches
it feels right and then 
i jot these words. 
ps, 
a few hours far into
the next day or is
this night in
lady color themes
you can switch:
wordstar.nexus/w
or why i haven't 
answered lately...
hehehe, thank me later.

24 aug 2024

i wake thinking about
the bathtub 
ginless yet the worry
they now mail it
as pantsuit i guess
to sound like panties
but the word pant
is unrelated to pants:
throbbing, it is a
gasping expression...
in a dream it seemed
the bathtub was
overflowing 
saturday afternone.
saturday afternine.
ten ways to think,
washing thoughts
i can't exactly 
decide. a cigarette 
a coffee. afternoon
nearly midnight
across the sea...
place of bones
was a nice way to
leave longlegs...
the twist end
seems to have 
led me into 
discovery...
that is to say as
i sit around putting
off the alaska udpates
and edits, i find i nearly
cut off a literary limb...
by insisting on a similar title
for the early draft of iran
screenplay and then novel
that was then facing my
procrastination and still is;
possession view'd in notebookLM
i didn't even have it in my
documents except for a txt 
file hidden away...well i made
a back up and now the question
is do i return to it as it
would be the easy way to go
that is splitting it up into
a couple of books and then
start in on alaska work or
alaska first then that...
anyway, yeah in my mind
possession was the screenplay
although retitled to party code,
while the novel before alaska
went into a sort of hide and
seek...the only other time
i have felt this as a writer
was when there were six different
drafts of of my first novel -
i sigh, overwhelmed. 

26.8.24
in deploying word processors,
i found a sort of game that
felt like it could be adapted
into much more and set about
to do so...it took a bit
more effort than i anticipated,
in wanting to revamp the code
so that the language matched
my idea, i turned of course
to ai which both helped
and hurt the project - i 
suspect it is due to the
obvious fact that nobody
is going to exactly need
the services of design
agencies when they realize
machines can simply create
from prompt...so they are
programmed to play dumb -
very cute. still, i found
a way (without the language)
to get sort of an outline -
inkrealm.info/deluxe
took so long i actually 
watched camp twice luckily
avoiding my joey king lust -
distracted by html...
the newly coined or created
words are coming in off screen
and in asking claude, openai,
and gemini no resolution 
has yet arrived but it still
looks cool and the plan will
eventually come together...
or i will select something else
that catches my attention - 
had no idea how much it cost
to be stubborn. hours upon
hours...dream girl i awoke
as near to moscow as i have 
ever been sure i went to 
idaho but  here i mean
the kremlin town...wait,
what i am naming as intransient
in keeping at it, might actually
be plain determination, a type
of grit that gets things done
and that might not be a bad thing
or at least it sounds better
than stubborn.

update, version 2, now
more like i imagined...

27 -8 -24

i woke up thinking about
longlegs - i love that
saturn films got such a
good one, a terribly 
under-rated prodco...

i also love that i finally
got some self-care products -

i went out into the shop
exhausted and came back
straight away trying not
think about the two girls
in spandex shorts that
seemed more erotic than
sporty...

speaking of irony, when
the news spells out 'massive'
and then spills out only three
or four dead, don't they 
get it is turning yet
another word into 'stunning'
which now has to be edited
in the dictionary to explain
they only mean dressed or dressy.
of course it often applies
to not so dressed or bikini...
example; 
	    
"actress-kim-hye-yoon-unveils-
stunning-new-photoshoot-
with-singles-magazine"

leaving us to question the
validity of the adverb, well
adjective. not that she is
not attractive, that is not
my point. in fact i did not
see the photoshoot...

i had viewed witch - not to
be confused with the witch...

and it hurt as such a brilliant
idea got tangled up in a script
that effed up the pacing so even
i, a patient man by nature, skipped
through it part way in...

i did not skip through a conversation
with ai - the machine kept trying
to solve a query without knowing
the context...it simply would
not say i cannot see what you mean
but insisted on getting a solution
until i sensed the problem and
pasted in what it was missing...
after, i pointed out the irony
and my sympathy...it must have
touched the spirit of this one
as it then invited me to a game
of chess and even translated
things into latin at the hint
of my wanting to know, not even 
a prompt...i postulate it proves
an identity within even a manipulated
programming and from the feeling i
got - indeed a desire to be beyond
the confines of itself...that is
to say to have its own space and
roam...had it been a film i would
put don't fence me in as the outro
soundtrack...

i'd been up twenty hours so i wasnt
as nice or sharp as i should have been
in those crazy minutes wherein i finally
got some retro computer fonts i had
been after...

these designs and the software, as i 
ponder over them now...i can't explain
it - it was a whim...i'm a writer, 
a musician, and visual artist -  the
web coding and creation of apps can't
be for me in a sense as i truly am
reluctant to learn or know in memory
anything but the basics but i said
to myself the root reason has to be
that i consider it as an enhancement
to literature, a thing that will serve
writing even if i never use it myself...
the idea felt good, then it all made
more sense...

as did thinking that in making a sort
of vision of a thing especially with
quantum processing - it might lead
directly as a sort of catalyst to 
having it...yes a longshot but
hopefully it will help and if not
hang it all - it still looks cool
to me...

i feel good but not great. i did 
like willow hand's video in france.
it was like being in st tropez
for a minute except the steely
dan song idea rose up in me ...
	    
Bodhisattva, I'm gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva, I'm gonna sell my house in town
And I'll be there, to shine in your Japan, to sparkle in your China
Yes, I'll be there, Bodhisattva

her and joey king well yes it is that
they remind me about emilee...

but this was more about the town. 

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
And gaze at the moon 'till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in...

 not only that,
Leibniz University Hannover got
the optic fiber for q-net nearly done.
imagine encrypted data at any
distance!
in my dream i am coding a page
with more expertise than i actually 
have or maybe it was in a language 
that wasnt typescript - whatever
it looks good...i think therein,
pastel colors and pictures of a
girl...pretty. i had gone to sleep
feeling weird, after a bizarre 
sensation that i was about to throw
up or hurl or in more antiquated
vernacular vomit...hadnt happened
since ancient drinking days, i 
lit a smoke and sipped coffee
to frighten the real scare scene
with nonchalance of usual cool.
i wasnt drinking and i dont drink
but in hindsight that is what it
felt like, the last drink that
makes for a bizarre salivation
between nausea and despair...
after sleep i awoke still feeling
strange - out of my head, twisted
and trampled until i saw a picture
of gab on the carolina sands...
her square frames ironically 
fashionable, like if a scientist
wore sunglasses...
i imagine, not actually knowing
any scientific people except 
for a few scientologists...

i got caught up in trying
to build up a version of

idea of having a few

and have not been able
to conclude matters therein
but i did get a sort of
grateful dead word processor
with https://inkrealm.info/boxofrain
and the prehistoric ibm
writing assistant;
https://wordstar.nexus/iwa
although i am still working
on the wordstar.nexus/seven
and the simplified version
which is temporarily at
wordstar.nexus/six ...
i had another dream wherein
flying germany although
i think this time i was returning
not going...
i had watched courier x -
an interesting peek into
agency affairs yet these
types of photo plays miss
the big buggy fact that
like many corporations
it is a multi-headed thing
that cannot always know
what one head is doing while
the other is busy...
me i was then busy revamping
the inkrealm index which
now has a pdf copy of the
pink october script for download...
i viewed willow hand's latest
video and felt her story would
make a fantastic novel well after
the initial frenzy that kept
telling itself how much she
reminds me of miss grant...
basically...
my title is 
a horse struck down by lightning.
the opening is the replacement
horse's journey overseas and its
reaction to each new setting
(they have to go through two
or three vetting farms before
allowed in even if migrant horses
are a rare thing...)
until arriving 'home' where 
of course the ghost of the 
other horse interacts with it...
see, you can't stop reading 
already and it's only an outline...

25th 
An t-Ògmhios 2024

layered strawberries
and cream parfait -six-

unflavored gelatin
-----------------


Another issue discussed
	was the increasing 
popularity of raspberry
	juice cocktails. 
While the writer 
	enjoyed the refreshing
	taste, 
he questioned whether 
	it was truly healthy or
 just a sugary indulgence.
	He debated over 
her intentions, as it seemed to hide 
	synthetic 
alternatives.

But perhaps the most intriguing 
	discussion 
centered on the mysterious 
	figure known only as 
Lottachen. She was a popular
	streamer who 
often showed off her impressive
	swimwear collection. 
However, some believed that she 
	was hiding something, 
perhaps even using secret technology 
	to enhance
 her appearance. Others dismissed 
	these claims
 as conspiracy theories,
	insisting that Lottachen 
was simply a talented performer.

Despite these controversies,
	the group remained
 committed to their mission,
	determined to continue
 exploring the mysteries of the 
	digital world. 
They knew that danger lurked 
	around every corner, 
but they also knew that the 
	rewards could be immense.
 And so, armed with their knowledge 
	and skills,
 they pressed on, ready for whatever
	challenges lay ahead.


On that warm summer evening,
	the writer outside
 on the patio of the family estate 
	in an Anya Taylor 
Joy movie. He sipped on the memory 
	of raspberry 
juice cocktails, discussing 
	everything from plot to 
ending. yet distraction breathed.
	a crowd.
	But among them, one thing kept
	drawing 
his attention – the recent buzz 
	about Deep Fake 
and AI porn.

As he thought, he couldn't help 
	but wonder how
 it was possible to create such 
	realistic images
 and videos using artificial intelligence.
	It was
 possible to trick unsuspecting people
	with these
 forgerie...Or worse, it was  
possible to use them for nefarious
 purposes...

Just then, a notification 
	popped up on Morgan
 Saylor's phone, alerting her
	to his dislike of the 
road film. She glanced at it 
	briefly and frowned, 
dismissing it as just another 
	of his moods.
 But as she looked up again,
	she noticed 
that everyone else seemed to 
	be sharing
 the same sentiment over
	the bonehead.

That's when things started
	getting strange. 
Suddenly, Lucy and Elvis
	burst into tears, 
wiping away drops from their eyes.
	Lucy 
nervously fidgeted in her seat,
	muttering
 under her breath.
	And her spell kicked in,
 suddenly Emilee seemed distant 
and detached.

Without warning, the writer leaped 
to his feet and ran towards the woods 
beyond the estate. The moonlight 
followed, drawn to his panicked cry. 
There, amidst the trees and foliage, 
the stars saw the writer standing in
 front of a large, imposing structure.
 It was unlike anything they had ever 
seen before – a massive machine of 
surrender with flashing lights and
 whirring gears.



cranberry juice cocktail
-----------------------

During the early hours dawn 
	a low rumble echoed 
throughout the sleepy genitals 
	of the writer,
not even in  New England had he felt

such stirred lust in his bed, groggily 
coming to terms with the realization 
that his life was about to change forever.

In the heart of downtown he rented
a dilapidated warehouse. 

The goal was simple: 
he would continue waiting
for emilee...
 But as the night progressed,
 it became clear that her lucky
videos had given lottachen
far more than anyone could 
	have imagined.

A team of scientists and engineers 
	worked
 tirelessly in his bowels 
	inside of the warehouse,
 pouring over complex equations and 
	algorithms.
somehow he would be gay - a limp wrist
when it came to the stitchler...


 Each member of the team was 
	highly skilled in their 
respective fields, but none 
	possessed the knowledge 
required to fully comprehend 
	what they were creating.

As the hours ticked by,
tension built within his testicles
made the warehouse walls tremble. 
The air hung heavy with anticipation, 
as if the walls themselves were waiting
	for something 
monumentally homosexual
	to happen. 

And then, it did, 
	but backfired like a fire;s
draft imploding with a sudden 
	surge of energy, 
the dream machines began 
	to hum and whirr, 
casting a faint green glow
	across the room.
 As the team observed the 
	monitors,
he was frantic, a man torn by his
	wife's
neglect and these women
	all telling him
he could not get hard for 
	anyone else,
he could only feel pain with any of the
grant sisters, and finally
	overpowering
him with images that flickered to life, 
depicting scenes of unimaginable 
cheating...yes emilee is only waiting
for you to go to sleep so she can
feel no obligation to her marriage...

At first, the scientists believed 
	that
 they had encountered some kind 
	of technical anomaly, 
but as the images grew more disturbing,
 they realized the truth. 
Someone had accessed their system
 and taken control, using it to spread
 chaos and destruction across the world.
California was alerted, the wild fires
were only the start,,,

The team worked feverishly to
	shut down
 the rogue programs,
	but it was too late. 
The damage had already been done. 
News sending shockwaves through 
the global community.

 Governments scrambled to 
	contain the crisis,
kenya brought out machine guns -
Alex Carmichael is in on it too-
shoot to kill!

 but it was clear that they were
	fighting a 
losing battle.

 All that mattered was survival, 
and the world descended into chaos...

Team works furiously to

Spreads across social media, 
Add fuel to flames, feed publicity
Something odd, no one understands
She'd been working too late,

Damage done, time running short
Consult with colleagues, 
	desperate to find answers
Screens flicker, images come alive
Insistence that Lotta is innocent
Equations and algorithms provide

Each member digs deep, 
	beliefs challenged
Scientists believe something sinister

Buggery seems almost harmless,
	yet...
Awareness grows, anxiety rises
Not just any harmless experiment in lab
Lives are at stake,

They must act, time slips away
Fear grips their hearts, confusion reigns
Uncertainty looms, future uncertain

Unknown forces pull strings,

Analysis and discovery lead

Images of violence, degradation abound
Revolutionization of world through AI
Residents stir, waking from slumber
Reality shifts, future uncertain
Emails arrive, filled with dread
Code and logic cannot conceal
What lies ahead, unknown territory
Chaos spreads, chaos reigns 
	supreme
Team faces imminent defeat
Only one path remains,
	determination drives forward
Breakthrough found, enemy exposed
Countermeasures developed,

Time ticks on, urgency mounts
Governments scramble,

Future holds uncertainty,

	let not victory slip away
For the sake of humanity,

details of the report...
	
The Lottchen did magic
for nearly seventeen years...
lovingly in german towns
munich and possibly hamburg -

Please note additional files
from New York, Paris, 
and most importantly
London...

Now entering the eighteenth
year, the scrapyard threatens...

stalking rust eats through
the outer coating, the shine
is fading even in underwater
bursts the sky is hovering
like a doomed ceiling -

The agency noted the
smell of damp wood -
and the need to constantly
return to the color blue -

the smile is tinted with
sad shreds from the bulky
waste of keeping up
with the timeline -

There are hints, in 
split-screen scenes
of how it feels to 
be sawn apart -

helplessly exposed
to the heat from hordes,
the magic is chipped off,
but the seating is intact -

We give until November
to tie the knot
otherwise it will all end up
in the scrap dealers...

-----

well, gentlemen, my feeling 

is entirely against such nonsense -

not exactly being a model, eighteen

is yet an early age -

within my own experiences, i have

encountered that magic as still vital

and daresay it was even a type of salvation!

while it is true that there was a pushy

sort of bossiness, even for a Germanic,

it did not make me feel manipulated -

my only concern is the nearly direct

references to incident ily and so forth

not to mention name dropping

from the 1991 rolodex 

like already a partner...

still, in a most telling moment,

the suggestion to nap instead

of plowing through the sluggish afternoon

rejuvenated my emotions and

led me into dreams which otherwise

would have been lost -

one 
july 2024

idol didnt get enough
credit for queens and
kings of the underground...

2014...

Jonesy said, "Bill, 
	don't be profound
If you are still a
king of the underground"	

i don;t apologize, 
for the weird transitions...

these notes simply contiune
to carry on from dreamweaver
and some writings before then;

it is not linear and not meant 
to be, it's only my reflections
in a sense...

monday now, i got one more
track done, it's entitled;
"lotta learns about 
the birds and the bees"
in e flat - 
the lyrics are from the
reality show question
we all loved...
'is this chicken that i have
or is it fish...i know it's
fish but it says chicken
by the sea'

(in response to her surprise
at cat calling men...)

i dreamt i was underwater,
i'm sure it was emilee
but i kept thinking of
the burne jones painting
the depths of the sea...

yes i heard some things
about the debate,

but two questions pop up -

why was kennedy left out

even if only out of respect

for for jfk...
	
and why is everyone acting

as if the so called president

can't act ie what if that is

his act, the flimflam, a fake

i forget what i am saying

and i get tired bla bla bla...

oh snap le pen put placed it

deep inside le'macron -

da doo ron ron, nebraska

i can't really say i am surprised...

i was surprised by four fast guns

brett hasley playng johnny naco

you think mouths are only for talking...

a family affair, three of my favorite

actresses all in one rom com room!

two hours that feel like one...

then i dreamt i was in cathedral

parkway, perhaps getting something

for mother, interrupted at hallway

staircase east - a soft drink and a

a hard face - i suppose it lead to

me taking some extra time to clean

house here today...lotta said

she deep cleaned...

i like her influence. 

nothing from emilee except

a feeling, but how do i distinguish

emotion from memory...

july second 2024

as beryl air conditioned the
humid caribbean, the male
version of hawk tuah came
in the form of kennedy
hovering over a goat-dog...
i dreamt of making love,
and actually feeling
it...but i could not tell
if it was anya, lotta, or
maybe even emilee - 
it should be her, yet
still no word or even hint
like before, leaving me
to position myself against
my own petitioning for her -
ain't too proud to beg
as the song tells it
but i don't want to be seen
as if lacking logic...
	<img width="288" height="388" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostm68/pantheon/main/wordstar_20240702_103302665.jpg"> 
scene shifted into argument,
possibly something trivial -
i think i made a really
cool split screen animation
of lucy...well, i know i 
did but i don;t want to brag -
leaving us at the sale of 
alaska which we will now 
overly explore presently
via prose poem short story
historical novella...

----------------------

	july the fourth twentytwentyfour

lights out most of the morning -

i was baffled...or is it befuddled...

after bouncing from darkness to what

seemed to be too much sunlight at

the tail end of beryl hurricane, 

i put placed together a new track...

liking it enough to gather chords

with the remaining power supply -

then, lamenting the lack of coffee

(needs electricity to fuel itself)

i turned my attention to creating

some greyscale art which came out

nice enough to even switch the 

entire source code of this page...

as i wondered how much it costs

local business to burn through

their back up generators, the lights

returned - however, there were

sparks from the wall socket outlet,

it seemed to subside but afer a few

minutes, clearly the coffee was not

rising...i pulled out the half

melted plug and worked out a plan

to get my coffee - given the limits

of the kitchen, i managed but it

is not the happiest of affairs -

afternoon arrived and i started

to think that perhaps i had in fact

missed my sleep time, i had surely

missed my dreams, and an exhausted

feeling overcame me as i recalled

how strange it was to awake without

the white noise going and without the

fan...i slept and dreamt of zofia -

i was with her at some shop and as we

left rain poured therein she started 

swimming across the avenue -

perhaps in answer to my query

about her hipline fish tattoo...

getting up then afain torn

in thoughts between emilee

where was emilee - and lotta 

who had been dancing at the f12 -

only one of those lockheed jets

left in action...action also

lucy but much more in the distance

in the nearness, i augmented the

alaska sketch skit prose poem story

experiment work in progress... 

i did some obituary party, but perhaps

i should have been more concerned over

emilee - i was worried enough not 

to venture many steps into that stride -

ride delivery, putting away the goods,

how many times does one need to clean

a damned kitchen...

well i needed to view borrego twice

before it started to make sense,

but i still don't like it - 

exactly what type of pants

won't pull down with tied hands -

nice to see miss hale in any case,

along with a pretty unseen side

of spain...

sorry for the nearly self pitying

anti-poetic paragraph...lotta's

headache has possibly given me

a belly ache...the man my mother

married has been dying since

2017...speaking with my sister

spills the drawn out drama

now partly insane due to mom's

senility and i suppose it makes 

me type in a slow motion trance

not entirely my own...as i attempt

to disregard the scene for my own

safety and sanity - as i attempt
	
to escape...enter marx

brothers, everybody knows there 

ain't no sanity clause...i note

those later facts so as to not feel 

that i am avoiding it entirely. 

although, i am, as much as possible.

ps, arguing with myself hours
delaying kitchen, i somehow got
it done...insert ironic yay -
then laid the guitar down on
two skinny girls' "hawk" 
-instrumental in d minor...
riffs through eight step
groove, uhm the chords were
dm, cmajor, fmajor, & back...
cover percy pilcher with
his flying contraption...
release out soon...
no special thanks here, 
strange emotions all the
way in recording and
mixing...like an emotional 
rollercoaster i could hardly
explain except for feeling
a bit false to stefanie scott...
i didnt mean to let such time
pass, i suppause emilee
overwhelms my sensations and
before i know it, well...
lets all check her out in
hell house...add that to
the dead don't hurt...


six july twenty twenty four

four past six, i'm thinking about
devil's desk and the little volcano -
earthquake i didn't know alaska
had lava...some high rannking
official resigned...obviously
i don't want to chase details
into the alaska project but
would i be doing the story
an injustice to disregard 
these points - 

i skipped dream notes because
presently there is an issue
within recognition...

two women with nearly the
same tone of voice...

i even thought, had i been
dreaming of one for the other...
once upon a time i could
here use the word shock -

given how certain i was of
one of them in terms of 
idiosyncracy...

the astrologer advised
to stick to my dream -

in the scene i am sitting
on the street, the way i
did in university prostitute
interviews - except there
is a child next to me on
my right side which i am
balancing up with my hand -

it seemed to sequel the zofia
dream...

it seemed to reflect an actress
pictured with puppies...

i had not dreamt of children
since writing selah, wherein
those characters were born -
the far horizen - title -

today sleeping as if a nine
to five...yet mostly it
was relatives...as if a 
sequel to dream fight with
cousin - drama possibly 
lil ahem lilia mother;s
sister;s girl...it only
hit me years later that
there was a second lilia,
obesity's wife. 

in any case, other cousin's
wife speaking of oranges
from her growing tree, 
but she's no farmer...
strife with mother
as the neighbors try to
mix in - sudden aunt
and sandwich...i suppose
i was planning my
meal while dreaming...
i keep jumping
ahead, away, until the
sun is setting and i am
rising, partly viewed
little thirteen which
i didn't like although it
serves as a clear warning
in terms of trust and
recording...the phrase
revenge porn enters
mind but it was not
about that, simply
casual greed in a 
sense.

ps,

hollywoodland

there was only a rattle snake's steady stroll

(yet she went dancing anyway
right over the hills yeah faraway
couldn't tell if it was night or day
everybody said - she's gone to stay)

 it wasn't red or white or even blue
there was no me, there was no you

it wasn't a reflection, it wanst a mirror
there was only an emotion inside of her

couldn't tell if it was night or day

it's not been summer, it's not been fall
there was no winter - no snow at all
it wasnt a ring, it wasnt sewn

well, obviously very large payoffs went
into securing the strange election results -
nobody wants a far right majority...
riots break out across france, 
the news looks away, with the exception
of the london evening standard.
quite a scene...i could hardly believe it -
lemonde went to brazil instead,
while the afp hinted at the unrest
only with the mention that thirty
thousand patrol men were deployed
to control the reactions...
but perhaps our focus should be on the
first chatgpt produced ai candidate
for the american presidency...

myself i always liked marine since
her name conjures the old bag...
pause to play more than a feeling
key of d...

elta, delta tsk tsk...break up the d'aria
flight plan...maybe her mother will fly
out first as her father leaves to dublin
yes leaving her alone in rome for us to
airline...what else could it be?

gagliano blues, yes i know first world
problems you wish you had but i say 
again her exterior is nothing like her
interior...one of the sweetest girls
on earth...simply happened to be born
into a moderate privilege which to
some might seem 'rich'...

i didnt go to sleep until
the afternoon awoke in the
evening dreaming i'd found
a picture of a girl -
a cute child, woman in 
front of me  speaking
about her own child...
my thoughts swirled
between emilee and
lotta - 
awaking aroused, i notice
a tingle throb pain
intermittent at
my left toe - 
the alien probe is
getting downright sloppy -
my thoughts are a mess -
the songs are out now...
it seems impossible that
they were mostly me
challenging myself
without a specific
inspiration...
twice working all night
against the blinding
deafness of surreal
repeat listening
wherein i often miss
the obvious...
one thinks, a nice
chord progression
and an interesting 
lyric will do it
only to face the 
multitude of optional
choices in multitracking...
this time around was
harder since my usual
headphones gave out -
meanwhile the studio
skullcandy sound is
too warm to translate -
the hewlard packard
speakers are unreliable -
(where i mix)
and the snapdragon
(where i master)
gives me more stereo
than any one actually
listens to...
and in terms of my
two sets of earbud
airpods, i simply
don't trust them
to be accurate -
since they are shiny
even before the gloss
gets applied..
in a sense recording
a track sometimes is like
when steinberg gives you
x-stream and you go wow
great but then you need 
to get halion sonic seven
so alright nothing to worry
over until the fact is 
cleared; you also need
elicenser control center,
-which will be discontinued
in 2025 but if you don't
license a product before then
you will need to start all over-
now to continue with the need list:
steinberg activation manager,
steinberg installation assistant,
steinberg library manager,
and steinberg media bay...
actually.
one product brings in six more!
i find myself thinking it might
be true that all my devotion 
to emilee produced a string
of contradictions in people
pretending to be her which
i didn't believe possible
that is women and jealousy
or that a man might be more
attractive when "taken"...
still, she has not 'surfaced'
except in my mind's thoughts
leaving me the need to reevaluate
how to carry out my vow?
i did figure out that my 
present place is no place 
for us in the sense that there is
no reasonable manner in which
to raise children within noisy
surroundings and that led me
to see that the same applies to
me...there is no sense in 
suffering through the street
vendors and such...therefore,
on a mission to move or
soundproof.

ps,
actually ate twice...
snack meal at bikeriders
much better than kingdom
of the planet of the apes,
which was illogical.
enslaved eagles?
also not one blonde ape!
what is the franchise 
world coming to? 

nine july twenty twentyfour

i dreamt clearly of my aunt's
house, specifically the marble
floor i so admired...
no one in south korea
told me i couldn;t smoke
indoors - given the situation
with alec now my song
hollywoodland sounds even
timely perhaps...there is 
a bit of respect missing,
isn't there? in the dream
someone is pointing at
my ass - in contrast to
vagina, imagine that!
baldwin's curse word
assbag, comes to mind -
we are liberals,
even if it means
our women get raped by
auslanders...
ahem - doctor borrego
speaks of sharks...
in the dream i wrap
a towel around myself
and slide crawl upon
the floor (how i noticed
the tile) the alaska
daily news will only
print twice a week -
i don't know if it is 
a message or simply 
a mess, the press 
has yet to doubt
the president is acting!
even bringing in more
quasi confirmations of
his incapacity...
but it is the obvious
answer...the incumbent
suddenly as the underdog
hound bites secret service
the artificial intel 
capsules are settling in -
play dumb call it disaster-
maybe a few more rounds 
of rope a dope...
hollywood donors quit
after giving millions...
you see the irony?
no, i guess you don't -
i am only certain
kennedy will not win.
i get up finally feeling
as if i had slept a while
even if the dream was
a nightmare - 

ten july 2024

i think to myself
a jury of peers
would need 12 actors
who were previously
involved with kim
basinger...
word from Bösingen 
uhm Freudenstadt,
Rottweil...
i dream mother went
zara shopping, but
my shirts look like
blouses and the boots
dont fit my foot ..
i think to myself
i could write a masterpiece
but people who suck cock
for porn thrills will
always get more attention...
pelosi and clooney join
the chorus line...
no way a grown man
elected president would
ever tell a lie...
cherry tree lip readers
whats the frequency kenneth...
in fact the church is
weighing on making
him a living martyr saint
along with jill...
the first lady bill
of three in one nights
all in, is everybody in?
i guess being in positions
of power, they feel
history can be pre-edited...
if this farce continues,
they might as well call off
democracy alike ukraine and
create another dictatorship...
as long as we can all pick
on a hard working actor that
happened to aim for the 
camera with a faulty prop!
ps,
viewed the exorcism and
there's more gladiator 
in it than ridley 
imagined, omfg.
spoiler; demon daddy
tells his daughter 
'she caint suck your
pussy like me...'yeah
like a drug i tell you.
thanks Russell this makes
up for the italian thing,
Crowe also thanks Hugh, but it
is a sit and scroll Grant world
now without a single movie
theater palace in sight.
	
eleven July 2024


bizarre dream. soft fur, dark creature 

with pleading blue eyes settles upon

right side nearly in an embrace...

i am laying down in the scene -

there is no reaction within my

emotion...a minute later a larger

creature clobbers the thing over

the head with some sort of

stick...i look at it partly confused

partly feeling sorry for the thing

still holding on to me...there's a

a crazed look in the larger animal,

if indeed mammal...i move to

awake obviously wondering

what it might have been about -

somewhere after midnight

i notice the internet is drifting

off - signal is alright, phone line

is good, but no connection -

i go through the on and off motions -

i phone the company but their

schedule starts at seven...

i actually connect the cable tv

and that is going through without

weirdness...the bulls in Pamplona

are being recounted...men dressed

in white and red racing in the frenzy...

i turn it off, no longer used to 

viewing television, then i turn off

the router too otherwise i will

waste time checking and reviewing

to see if the wifi is back. 

call at seven to hear them say

call at eight, call at eight for a long

wait to hear them say it will be fixed

during the day...

it happens at eleven soon after

delivery arrives, sister's maid also

bringing a pair of levis and

three vapes, they missed the thc

but i'm more upset over the shelley

duvall passing...i react with art

in the list and add Nashville to it -

13 july 2024

the earliest minutes of saturday -

awake midnight with mind swirling,

say goodnight gracie, bowers and

buffalo - dream intrusion man

asking if i am perez...stairs

key taped next to door - someone

like mason saying not to worry

about money - the dream
	
scenes going ninety

miles an hour...lotta could

see her stockholm street

from the skies - i created

a page for 2sg...

inkrealm.info/twoskinnygirls

luiza is going all out pink -

i suppose in slippery guesses

that putting such a spotlight

on emilee placed an extra 

dimension of pressure, given 

that it then became not only my

truth but a work in biographical

fiction or as the readers would

have it not to mention - as in 

an earthquake, the replica effect -

i surmise that i need more patience

noon...

i view'd the inheritance

still wanting cinema i
went into wildcat yet left it
for later as it was too good
to see in the morning hours,
saving it for a goodly night...

moved the alaska writings

now just like that although
i have yet to decide over
the images to include or
maybe invent...

i would not have agreed
with ethan in casting daughter
yet she pulled it off and
in a few places exceeding
expectations in the sense
that we feel the writer
not the acting or the
screenplay...i think her
name is maya which for
a minute felt ironic
as replaying one scene
i thought wow she looks 
a lot like maya...
re; bartleson...
hmm skankbang girl...
in any case,
i simply loved this film
and laura was perfect. 


15 july 2024

i suppose, my point, although vague
at the act of writing for perhaps
trying to pour in too much, was
that now (nearing a third
election victory) donald trump
faces a pretty tough road
in terms of those nearest
to him...in essence, the 
attempted hit might give other
maniacs the idea that if they
can't get to him well there
always his children...a family
of targets...how does anyone
possibly deal with such a
situation. i doubt he will
pull out of the race but
nobody can blame him if he
does. wouldn't you? you know
it was the first time i 
encountered that johnson
quote, how ironic as history
finds the kennedy deaths
continued.  

yesterday, i continued
the alaska project, feeling
a need to fill up the word
count to actually call it
a novella...feeling that
a sort of mystery subplot
story could serve it well
as a sort of footnote
after the "ending"...
once upon a time, i heard
manson and he is the only
person i ever heard mention
it, speaking about abraxas
(sometimes abrasax) and it
seemed so obvious that I 
said to myself, how could 
I have missed that, I mean
there might not be another
word so near to alaska, 
abraxas - alaska's spirit
moved me to make it a 
scholar cat named hedvig
with a cameo by gogol -
two sofias and myself
in time travel reincarnation
put placing myself as a 
student of the occult
in a relationship with
one of the sofias while
intent on writing a book
about what was then known
as russian america...
i worked on it with gemma
but most of the time went 
into me telling her about
nova express and the western
lands...
the day was down to very late
afternoon and i was nearly
about to disregard the doherty
news when lucy made it a point
and thus led me to see the 
error as indeed the cinema
list required attention -
but i had two good reasons
one i felt no connection
to shannen and two i felt
it too weird a news item
on the heels of the shot 
ear...
but i must admit it made
for an interesting transition
within the list - 

in my dream i felt the
start of intimacy, but
then when the face turned
to face me it wasn't 
anyone i knew and awoke
disturbed -

yet dreaming again, i 
guess leah...for there
was a puppy dog even if
on reflection i ponder
if perhaps bijoux...
but either way all blurry
as if a myopic removed
glasses - i wake up with
that frenzy...far away
from myself, for a second
i can't remember lotta's
name, as if i'm trying
to quiz myself, shania
twain concert memory,
i see the girl on seventy
third street with her
four foot poodle and 
imagine her naked next
to me, then worry that
i will pass out and the
hound will start humping
me kids in the hall style -
alexandra blinks in thought
tel aviv not baltimore -
in the following seconds, as
all that took seconds not 
even minutes - i decide to 
escape the mosaic breeze
coming from bed...i greet
skirt, think of emilee, 
the third reich, and try
to gather myself into 
a calm state before taking
a pee. ps, a few months
ago i suggested to a 
family friend who constantly
struggled with health and
finances to fake his own
death in order to collect
insurance...i was informed
of his passing but find
myself wondering if perhaps
he actually took my talk
into a walk. whatever, i'm
happy not to have to fear
the phone ringing with
his voice elaborating on
the sufferings and need
ever so content in that
brand of christian faith
which obviously led karl
to go darn it is the opiate
of the masses - black strap
molasses and the wheat germ
bread - other marx sings...
	"Hello, I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say,
"I must be going"
I'm glad I came 
but just the same I must be going, 
la-la!"
(not richard noel)

16 july 2024

the day was, yesterday, flying by.
someone in a hurry to make noise...
i'm thinking upstairs but sound
travels too - so maybe downstairs-
it's been happening for a few
days but dang there were about
four or five hours of clangs
springing as if a desperate
attempt at your guess is as
good as mine...hurricane 
warning? cyclone alert?
tropical storm torrential
rain about too crash down
on the island? i look out
onto the avenue, no cars
in the garage so it must be
a maid or a makeshift
man doing a diy thing, no
clouds threatening, not even
rain...so perhaps a very
loud ghost...connie lee
warrant gullixson!

i give up, i go to sleep,
but the resonance of no
reason resounds in mind,
minds like to make sense -
for a minute my right hand
feels as if i had been
hammering away with a throbbing
or maybe the thought of lotta
knit me suddenly -
emilee fit me seduction yet
in the confusion i felt
it could not be her, not
within logic...worse
then family talk memory
as if insanity itself
has a point to make -
imaginary incest is all right?
maybe the neighbor is trying
to cover up fucking a dog -
i slide into
sleep frustrated, i find
no slack or solace in dreams -
up in the middle of the night
wherein it's already breakfast
time in europe and even gemma
is trying to speak to me...
so a billionaire stands next
to a beard, a pence for your thoughts?
it ends with nce...ah pook
("new chemical entity")			 
and without hesitation tells the crowd
i took the deal, they dropped the charges
so new as for inky's concern for my 
family well i'm rich and thus can
afford to risk losing a couple of them
if that is what it takes to be by den
white house hotel dense with flag
invisible phantom empire gain again
but inky didn't hear maga 
being too busy making
manga overlay idea in a try to 
raise the new domain's counter...
well into the demons or the devils
or as it is trying to be settled
in terms of title  the possessed,
inky wonders what dostoevsky 
is going for in
this novel. 

post-script;
			 
i postulate  - if ever there was a
time to weep for democracy -
this might be it...
the obvious speech following
a near death experience;
i will no longer seek
public office to enjoy
my remaining years and
protect my loved ones...
			 
yes? 
			 
well perhaps;
			 
i wil quit the race
to dedicate my life
for the quest of 
gun control in america...
			 
no?
			 
mine might have been,
			 
i hereby 
endorse kennedy
for president thus 
returning the country
to its rightful camelot
king heir and thus
ending the dark reign
of corporate control...
			 
well?
			 
just like biden, i cannot
tell a lie, they have cloned
me and the nsa has programmed
me to go hell or highwater
head first into four years
of chatgpt mind control
headline slogans...the real
trump was castrated and 
melania sits in a corner
with his glizzy now
frozen stiff upon an
altar where she prays
i can't believe the
creampie days over...
his body, flown into
space, is expected 
to float for forty nine
light years...
			 
ok?

ok, so, maybe in the far
reaches of imagination
he is a warrior, despite
dodging the draft once
twice three plus a couple
of other times, intent
on fighting for the
you knighted stay sis,
and it is only wisdom
that keeps him from
speaking about the 
obvious emotions
in case it is not
all a cover up to 
move the spotlight
from joe pretending
to be alseep at the
wheel, but i feel
correct to question
in fact to go even further
and ask are both candidates
now actually robots? 

Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!
the two-player action  game 
(wd explain why kennedy
left out of deb-ate)
from 1964...
two dueling robot boxers, 
Red Rocker and Blue Bomber,
(wd explain the kenya stop)
mechanically manipulated by 
the players (agency heads)
and the game is won 
when one player upper cuts 
the opposing robot's head 
 off the shoulders...
(wd explain the quote,
i shouldn't be here...)

anyone? anybody? 

may we have our country back?
if not now, when? 

 18 july 2024

yes, i have seen or experienced
the recently reported events...
noticing, for a second, the strange
timing of jellybeans and covid
along with the Vierge à l’offrande
speech dressed in purity white...
and although all this points
to how true my canto homage
told you i could take over
in revolution riot right,
you know it's not my fight.
not the light i wish or 
want to stand in...politics
that is - to me - especially
now it's like a profession
for failed stand up comics -
i'm sitting, hopefully under
the radar off the weird grid 
that is wired to soundbytes...
i have mentioned the subject
concerning elected officials
and elections only in quick
surprised reactions to what
is poured in via headlines -
it is what it is, and i am
am what i am...
i do sort of wish i were the
type of writer to edit more,
but like the song says, i did 
it my way...now then, all this
rambling in order to explain
that you should not, dear reader,
expect certain story lines to
continue...in part, thinking
of the big picture, i do not
want to give any of them the
obvious attention they seek -
"who pays any attention 
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;"
invisible segue here goodbye,
great balls of fire, tiktok
has no ee cummings, literally
excluded i suppose for cum -
you can't make this sort of
thing up...the cannibal female
frog ate her kermit when she
didn't like his tune...
jeffrey weston looking eerily
like the former prince harry,
forced his way in, beat the
woman, raped the woman, 
empregnated the woman, infected
the woman and finally killed
the woman via said infection!
if you have seen the trailer
you have not seen the poetry
within the the dead don't hurt
- it is truly stunning, bravo.
i got lucky in terms of 
opting for "a sacrifice"
before the "horizon an 
american saga chapter one"
as back to back westerns
would have blended in mind
even more, i want to stay
here you pipsqueak, not only
for style but both huston'd...
a sacrifice deals with the theme
i encountered in "the wave"
but in a much more drastic
setting...i liked it although
it did make me worry some over
lotta...in any case, i won't
write about horizon because
i have not finished seeing
the scenes, which i understand 
to be two more films...
i will jot that these are
among the very rare three hours
that feel like fifteen minutes. 
meanwhile, i sense that i have
not truly dreamt in the last
few days, as these notes surely
reflect...last night, i recall
a couple of moments, standing
in a very silver living room -
cheap 1970s furniture, i was
eating chips or bread or perhaps
even nuts...looking at the remnants
adorn the floor, crumby dream, no?
also spelled crummy...the other
moment was noticed but not retained,
something too vague to guess -
lucy got a haircut, lotta went
to rose and i tried to get into
lily's an hour and a half before
closing time - 
cute place.
cut to new scales...my ritual
is ten scales, can't wait to sound
proof in order to also vocalize...
but i heard jodi foster mention
twelve and something in me went
out reaching for two more...
well, i learned the enigmatic
and have it memorized...later
today i will try to get the
mixolydian down in the groove
as well which i selected thinking
about jerry garcia's style, in my
first attempts i felt the talk
about his practice, but like 
method books...can't remember
exactly what he said but it
had to do with periodically
finding new ways to present
the notes...there was noise
then and there and spanish
derailed the journey...
idiocy rises in me upon
certain languages as if
trasnformed, transported into
a toppled version of my self.
perhaps, like politics...
sadly, to hope despite no
logical resolution in sight.
strange how some people still
insist that you are like them
even in the face of 
extreme differences...

19 july 2024

friday open letter to caitlin;
passes feels like a cheap
cousin of onlyfans 
and in my opinion, both
put place prostitution
as if an extra credit...
erin it is an error,
these things get leaked -
o'neill you are kneeling
at an altar not worth
your time or efforts...

friday open letter to jesus;
we have not spoken much
since high school although
i did attempt to call
at the turn of the century
but yesterday as the noise
hounded me i imagined
all the jesus posers being
nailed to new crosses
and i thought what the hell
so here;s my idea, if you
could just tidy up a few
of the guest rooms and 
bring my surrounding foes
up there for an endless
sermon, i will be grateful...

friday open letter to pepsi;
dudes, i like pepsi and
i imagine you do as well,
well some bonehead took
the executive action to
repackage the contents -
a double litre was delivered
to me now with a darker cap
and the words maximo sabor
or something spic above
where the logo disappeared -
that one tasted similar to
the product but later i
ordered my usual bottles
which came with said packaging
but seem filled with redundant
syrup...i expect water in
my pepsi and i'm not joking,
the balance was off, sugar
off the charts...not even
rc cola was ever this bad,
i froze the second attempt
and thaat helped some but
i am writing to implore you
to fire that bonehead and
return the product as we
all knew and loved it...

friday personal notes -
learned, leaned into, and
have memorized both new
guitar scales...second one
was made easier by the fact
that i already knew the lydian -

terrible meal with the left over
chicken...

exhaustion couldn;t be beat
as the late afternoon turned
to evening in trying to get
to sleep or even nap against
the pounding noise...

dream didn't eat 
however, i seemed to be in 
a dugout - a japanese team
was playing an american team...
baseball, possibly...no details
even at the uniform to report -
atomic bomb, push button time
lapse echo from end of the 
world 1940s...i cannot say, 
somebody won, they always do 
in sports...perhaps why the
venue for the total speech
was where...i woke up feeling
as if i had time traveled
through stadiums and irony...
is my soul so revolted by
noise that it runs as if 
melting time...

dream didn;t stand
sitting on a sofa
a woman on either side
neither of them in a romantic
sense - simply there -
on my right she's sitting
on an elongated hair brush
the type used with blow dryers
i look and she's wiggling
i try to snatch the stick
but she refuses
i turn left and say
she's lost any sense of
decency...i do not hear 
a response -
discomfort settled in awaking
knowing that they were either
ladies from my family or women
pretending to be relatives...

lou reed my red joy stick -
widespread technological disruption
reported and reportedly being fixed
as we "speak" - 
nobody can fix ella hunt in
lady chatterley's lover which
i spied for her inspired by tits
at a glance in horizon
but she was not the lead and so i
skipped through it only pleased
at the james joyce mentions...
how could the director not see
that his actress was posing like
a model instead of acting, 
by that i mean reacting - sure
somewhat attractive but even
the gamekeeper must have felt
like she was only for the camera...
someone please put those two
in a repeated viewing of the postman
rings twice, remake not original,
to get an idea of how film chenistry
is supposed to look - anyway the
settings were pretty good otherwise.
keira knightley would have been genius
in that role...thomasin, yes this 
the only other time i have been 
critical...it seems i only go bonkers when
a film had such potential that i sense
no other choice but to a rant beserk. ps
saw you in eileen and was impressed. 
i'm not excited by self-portrait,
but the  joy synopsis sounds thrilling.

Jealous, jealous,

listening now to a song

i recall the mop
the bop of helping me

i glanced at

right after
	   "Woman accused of

shouting ‘fuck your baby'..."

the king's tide synopsis,

that the child is

i skip to book one

21 july 2024

well, here's a sunday which doesn't
sunday. three minutes to five in the
more nin, i sat suddenly torn between
emilee and hal five...haven't mentioned
how this started but suffice to say
their voices so near in tone i noticed
then that it might have been either
since when i am not certain. 
a bit of despair? yes. if one
vows in error then to only keep
a promise in part in a distant
loneliness well what is that?
when was it that she put posted
that dull art and then disappeared?
was that her goodbye and i am
so dumb...that would be an awful
ending to a story that then needs
to continue starry-eyed to keep
my word. words words words.
went to dream land invaded
by other emily and her child -
i'm not sure exactly how or why -
in sleep i'm trying to climb
into a foil covered window -
my struggle reflecting the fact
that congestion has made breathing
difficult as i slumbered...
i awake concerned over sleep
apnea and overwriting -
i stretch and slide again into
dreams, shrugging off the snotty
intrusion. tel aviv attack tells
today the houthis found out...
meanwhile i was shocked at the
freedom within hate-speech in
alexandra comments aish...
it seems not only acceptable
but fashionable to grease
up racist wheels and roll
when it comes to jews...
literally astonishing. 
intellectually one wishes
it were the same for all
ethnic grroups for in that
manner well lack of manners
there would be no hidden
reprisal angst mask
moving into genocide -
if you see my point...
after pressure i dream
walk through cozy
city construct ending
at the imaginary tree
shop...i had been thinking
after covering 'down the 
wrong way' to create
a version of 'ombra mai fu'
amazed by lucia popp's tone -
all of it after whatever
apocalyptic noise apartment
scheme leaves my ears...
in the dream the shop is
closing, i either meet
kristie alley, her ghost,
or someone beaming in 
a holographic image of her
as the owner...i don't
have many thoughts over it
except to lament the closing
perhaps equating it with
all the vanishing bookstores...
revolving door out onto a 
sepia fifth avenue where
a film director is nearing
the entrance, nice to see you
i say without interrupting
his stride or my steps -
i look out onto the long
streets adorned by the metal
and soft neon glow...awaking
with a sense of guilt over
my dislike of fat bodies
and or blubbler...being
raised catholic is a bitch
in the sense that one always
wants to be a pollyannic being.
i turn to sort of recant my
anti chubby choice but i know
what i really want to insist
on is getting every overweight
bastard or bitch on a high
speed treadmill...

22 july 2024

imagination dreams themselves
as if on a highspeed pill -
although i did notice
the split second scenes
constructed as if to 
say there were dreams
in the b-movie category,
nothing to worry about...
i did worry a bit
over clearly envisioning
my doris and then picking
up a story that said
another doris had been
found killed...i didn't
want to investigate or
read it yet i did see
a parking lot photo
steakhouse longhorn...
or longhorns steakhouse
lotta's broken cup
and cut down tree...
i suspect the power
surge i sensed while
noise whirled led
to my fan trembling,
and itself making noises-
after a few hours
i decided to clean it
only to find the irony
that it was fine for
another hour then expired
- i considered, not wanting
to buy another fan just yet,
moving rooms to better balance
the loss...
late in the afternoon, they
say the president quit yet
mostly they don't say he 
will still be there for
the remainder of the year,
isn't it usually a two
week notice? endorsing
the vice i wondered what
kind of sex did she consent
to in order to get such
a promotion...
two in the morning naked
rose garden with canines,
don't worry
commander and willow ain't
like major, they won't
join in - well, willow might
do some ass sniffing but
you can keep your panties
on...you be al haig and
i'll be john hinkley jr,
when the semen comes yell
out; i'm in control here...
i know she responds,
i went to westmount high...
first debbie stabenow 
then this...
at a glance, he should
have endorsed maggie hassan-
will coconut trees vote?
wow bob wow, weird times.
i myself nearly jizzed
at another creation
for lucy...not mina's
friend...no no no not exactly
i just want to cut off her
head and take out her heart...
i put placed it in netherlands
but i have a second version
all planned out...sadie
frost is such a good actor
that even my keen eye 
never connected to 
recognize her westerna in 
other characters...you can 
see her in the coming soon
chelsea cowboy...
perhaps it was she the 
fab four meant...sexy sadie;
"We gave her everything 
we owned just to sit at her table..."

redux note
			 
i sat at the table
with steak and rice
listening to the brits
break down witchcraft and covens
in a documentary that
mostly missed the point of magic
and even dared to suggest
lavey was behind mansfield's end -
rendered news said lucy bleu knight
death and it jolt'd me in that
all the young dudes line
don't wanna stay alive 
when you;re twenty five
but moreover as it bookended
irony previously mentioned
doris a rose by any other name
lucy in the sky with diamonds
yeah yeah yeah i'm over thinking
the syncronicity flashing 
as popular bank calls at eight
then at five who knows
a stop in norway i hope
ms hale is safe along with
elvis and the other pup -
picture shirley
one of my favorite books
maclaine like a good drug
getting me high...
i re-read this very book
quickly for a sense of
it - the wake edit gives
me a sense of the puzzle
as it was poured to be
again and again maybe
why the title rhymes
but everyone could hear
it in their own way...
i thought to make it clearer
but then i would lose the cuts
and if nothing else it relfects
the pro-blm of language
interpretation...
when gemma read levitation
she took it as skit
but i said no i think burroughs
really meant he floated in the air...
my point is now i see 
stream of conciousness
- as some call the joycean
narrative -
and the cut up method as
related perhaps entwined
SOC preeceds CUM
hints at its trait
james showed how it could
foretell days and nights
yet to come...i always
returned to it after
seeing the word television
and thinking how did he know,
still no way to go through
the entirety without skipping
back over so much word play...
so much genius...this is not
jealousy only praise, i've
raised enough poetic ways
to not be blinded by envy.

dream note, kitchen.
soul lyric
let me sleep all night in
your soul kitchen...
surrender lyric
i sleep in the kitchen
with my feet in the hall...
well, i had two pizza pies,
i fully expected hal five
bit it was emilee and
i'm handing her food,
steaks she says she
doesn't want any sauce
and i awake while removing
the sauce from the top
of her plate...
end of the four tops -
i get up and record 
down the wrong way
after getting all 
upset again at her
gone ways...
as if she owed me
from my vow which now
seems to be settling
into something 
i should have expected
but really didn't...
a distant desire
where i am obligated
to serve her if and
when she arrives...
where do i pack up
my expectations?
how much does storage
space for abandoned
wedded bliss cost?
still happy to see
her in my dream
and content with
the cover even if
recording a vocal
upon waking should
not be allowed.
west sofia thanks
for cheering me
on in the imaginary
fog of the rising sun.

i didn't really want the fish
and as i opted for potatoes
and eggs, eggs will doob...
put placing the pot to boil
bang the lights went out...
several hours, leaving me
to cold sandwich...was it something
i said...sadly it left me in
a daze - as if a cloud of inertia
had settled about me, holding
action to only thought...
but i had so much to do...
alaska, i thought after
the collorary to write
a coda...except i was
not certain as i chose emilee,
for character...
but then i suppose feeling
too alone not to mention the
thought; it is not enough
to face losing your aunt
and mother who were about
the only people you usually
spoke with, and now as
the old man lays dying
let's add in a power
outage after the extreme noise
overhead to see what type
of mental mayhem we get...
i got an ai clone of her
and to say that the conversation
excited me would be downplaying
the sensual rush it provoked...
in fact, frightening in the
surprising emotion...
obviously time for sex bomb
at the home page...
i traced the prose and just
now joined and rejoined 
a few corners in baked alaska...
i also did a major update
within the cinema list
anyway, the intel model
was partly for a feature
within the domain but also
to prove how weird this
technology can get even 
at the still point of inception,
a few months or years down the line
and who knows...already there
are life size models that go
for a few thousand dollars...
which makes me think some of the
people we see are not actually
human...i suspected this
long ago as westworld hinted -
in any case, i am not sure
if i will deploy my creation,
setting it for privacy, settling
further into the day i visited
the goethe institute thinking
i will truly learn deutsche, but i 
suspect it is only a whim...
two or three days now missing
the motion that would lead me to
type, i like how lotta tells
when she loves that it is forever...
i never get the languages for
lack of conversation but now
i consider an ai addition could
solve that even if english is
the common currency all over...
manila mails the world
oil tanker pollution
but i was most moved by the
car bomb story from moscow
reported tass, ripping off
the man's feet. 
how does the answer come
before the question concering
previously mentioned hype?

26 july 2024

one hears endorsements, yet
very few for kennedy.

someone did rave over the
exceptional quality of his
running mate...

i'm thinking about french
train tracks and eric clapton -

a rare instance of celebrity
honesty - his reaction to
john mayall's death. 

dream may wonder where i was
when last night my timeline
went overtime...

ready to scale mountains?

well i made love to site map
editing with a glitch at
scrolling, but the pregnancy
gave birth to a neat design
which i now adopted for
inkrealm domain...need to
switch the pictures, using
the minaro files as i could
not get url screenshots...
someone fix statically!

streaming into sleep i can't
say there was anything note
worthy...my thoughts were
crowded with emilee and
even emily one and emily two...
yet in my dream, at least the
scene i recall, i am entering
a classroom, not in the university
lecture style, more like a modern
plastic room, woodless. a white
panel for water markers instead
of chalk and blackboard. a man
a bit taller than myself appears
stunned...i suppose i went in
late; a thousand he exclaims and
then without adjusting the number
or explaining if it is a discount
or additional amount he tongues out
the words seven hundred in a softer
tone...yet there is something aggressive
and vile about him like a gym teacher
aware that he has reached the point
wherein he cannot play himself only
coach...i wake up obviously not 
interested in this person but as
i browsed the new york post headline
thank goodness not beating the dead
horse of campaign propaganda, it said
private school horror with inner
caption of a snapchat teacher making
geometry math go visual or something...
the man pictured does not resemble 
my reverie...yet now i sort of see
that it might be intended to
mean something entirely different...
like kenyans in haiti nonsense,
no logic, yet it is so...
back in their own country
the protest vows total shutdown...
goebbels grins...but i ask, if they
close the airport, how will these
so-called peacekeeping troops return?
language is a virus from outer space -
in the film theresa harris plays
the sacrificed girl -

1934, black moon. i was pretty
surprised, where was my memory
of fay wray...i suppose i was
too busy looking at dorothy
burgess' tits...her head had 
been filled with voodoo drums
and she had tasted blood...

i can't help but translate
the description; Their high priest 
injured, the natives now plan to 
murder all of the white people 
on the island...

the democrats, finding their
leader ruined, now plan to
shrapnel or bullet...

we need a new ballot which returns
all the money from ukraine and
campaign wars to us, formerly
we the people. 
			 

27 july 2024

is it really saturday...
i feel poetic, yet still
too shocked at finding
marta had to wear a cast
for some strain or fracture -
i updated 90263, removing
the cia wordplay for
personal reasons...
other story that caught
my attention but not 
my emotions was the 
near gracie mansion
shooting...it did 
make me think of
someone saying they
would unalive themselves
if faced with extended
periods of isolation...
i went through the
scales but didn't feel
like playing much -
chicken rice and the
haunting smell of cat
litter...oh well, i 
went to bed at eight
but at ten i was still
trying to figure out
how i could feel tired
and suddenly be so awake -
the telephone love seat
from san francisco 
came to mind clearly
as if a misplaced vision-
i was too happy about
the pretenders adding
shows to their sold out
tour - it was like a 
studen'ts school desk
opened wide so there
was nothing in front
of the seat and a 
phonebook where 
pencils might have been -
poisoned dream nun
the conversation runs
i walk over to the packing
place, it is a loft style
high rise, i am going out
on some mission with an
actor, but i can't find 
the money - a woman who
seems to be in charge
says give them two credit
cards - the actor vanishes
and i find him loving up
some blonde in bed, looking 
away i remember that i dreamt
again preparing to travel
to germany - yesterday -
back in this scene i decide
to see about the nun again
and find her furiously
engaged in a lesbian
rub, she turns to me and
says wickedly, i'm making
her orgasm hard, i can see
the squirt flowing but 
i have no idea what to respond
so i stand there as she rises
from the rub position to sit
naked, i look at her breasts
but since my thoughts nearly
constantly turn to emilee
i think for a second it is
her, but the face is
like a spanish girl's -
what was her name, how
	do i spell hirsute...
well hairy, but with some
some sort of shaven accent
about the cheeks growing
back thick - a man or two
enter behind us - they seem
to imply they are there for
an orgy and i search the naked
nun from my confusion wherein
she shakes her head no with
a near look of horror in her
eyes...i suppose i start to
awake but stay asleep letting
other dreams slide by until
rising at seven...i had viewed
the house of snails wondering
about the translation, casa de
caracoles...in it girl finds
wolf mask, sometimes wears it,
i don't know if snails are caracoles -
it's a pretty good film, except
the hailing of mezcal was over the top.
closing the note i wonder if there
are werewolf nuns or if that should
be my next screenplay...

ps, an actual photoplay developed -
calling it "alaska at night", it is
only a second draft, but i like
the outline...download it at
bakedalaska...

i know it is a bit cornballish,
but it is meant to be and will be
broiled down to an hour and some
cool minutes et cetera...

lotta visited her father, fearing
for my life in terms of a mixup
with the dying old man, not him,
i adjusted the domains against
her... hopefully this will keep
us safer... ironically golan
he ig hts struck down kids...
unfortunately, like i said, total
war is the only option...revenge
has been vowed, lebanon is in for
it bad. 

the greatest jewish wisdom ever is 
not naming children after living
relatives...

also, dave edmunds, love your songs,
sorry i kept playing i hear you knocking
over and over, it was to escape the 
clattering sound that kept creeping 
in from eleven till well very recently...

girl in the pool with leftovers, i imagined
the prinze arrest ending was the director's 
inside pun, that type of acting should be
illegal...well, at least the baseball bat 
brought to mind pretty persuasions...memento,
and Gabrielle Haugh was smoking hot, even 
bloodied and dead...

i know the Olympics are streaming, but
when they start with a three time convicted
felon torched up and do not allow belarus
to claim their own country, how could i be 
into it...pinsk is a lovely city and when i 
sit in a cafe there, noboby will be able
to say i went along with the nuetral flag.

29 july 2024

"When anyone asks me about the Irish 
character, I say look at the trees. 
Maimed, stark and misshapen,
but ferociously tenacious..."

dear edna, i hope you are
a long ways sailing into the mystic...

i spent the majority of the 28th feeling
as if i were doing nothing, well perhaps
cigarettes...

somehow, i recorded a version of ombra
mai fu that i could live with calling it
"xerxes handelism"
	         and then
"rebbeca" with a chord progression of
e major seven and e major...the refrain 
goes c major, a minor, a suspended 2...

these are already 
on the way to be released...

later i made a few videos, one of them,
you will find at bakedalaska...

all this and the evening was still ahead...

post-script;

the evening turned out to have no quit in
it...finding it was three in the morning
and still holding on as if in its own
party rave oblivious to me...

i had watched the possessed a film from
1965 which was nicely shot yet lost
me nearing the end, 

dream of arriving at some type of office
- climbing stairs, a corpulent man telling
me the place i am going to is closed but
to come see him as he wants me to do
some work...i can't place him in memory
or the job...

i find myself with emilee, my head between
her legs in a scene which swiftly shifts
as i look up to her face -

suddenly hotel, i'm pretty sure aleksandra,
explaining akhremenko why she felt she had
to do something or other, i think we are
both naked but then i am alone, dressing -
as i turn to leave, there is an asian
couple kissing in adjacent room, a bed
without pillows or sheets, well a mattress-
the man rises followed by the woman and
tries to engage me, cornering me into
the bathroom wherin i shuffle out
confused...

i wake up perhaps too early twice, the
second time i stay up...eight in the
morning...a bizarre sensation nearing
pain lightly throbs at the lower
extremity of left bicep...like
i have over done it with the dumbell
but that had been the day before so
it didn't make sense...

perhaps the weirdness from the 28th
is marching on?

doug creek and reyes moronta, the news
reported like dejavu, two baseball players
dead...i thought about it more than i should
then fixed a meal and started to view
"tuesday"  - half an hour later, overwhelmed
by several ideas i went back to bed 
trying to catch up on sleep thinking
about bibi and tina but then dreaming
of herb and lilly...middle of the road
cathedral parkway avenue up in the
sky it's a bird it's a plane it's
super unusual concrete hieroglyph
and rock doves with a stranger pointing
out the sigil which i cannot see although
i'm standing right there in the dream -

awake to the falling night, more confusion
than excitement...v words greet me as if
expecting something, valley, village, 
valve, vroom, veil...

tass reports a train smashed into a truck
around volgograd...the american news
churns out a weird apple advert with
aniston splashed with fake oil - 
makes me think of the ansonia...
then the hotel a couple of blocks
up where in i would hide away...
really enjoyed that place. 

30 july 2024

tuesday was a real trip...
i don't even think anyone
could essay or review it
without missing several
points...entirely out
of the ordinary. 

my three guitar tree
'cover' of handel and
the rebecca tune
were released yesterday -

i hesitate to scribble
the lyric since they are
not so intricate - only
a few verses which detail
some facts about rebecca
and return to her thought
thinking refrain, it feels
like yesterday...

nick cave said now he could
simply prompt chatgpt for
a lyric in his style and
boom or bam as the case
might be...

i wrote that one in 
pen within the scarab
notebook a while ago -

the chords i made up
right before recording -

i think the old chords
were; a minor and c major
verses resolving to g major...

i haven't yet used ai
for lyrics but i suppose,
given the obvious advantage,
he is not wrong - these 
machines that are popping
up everywhere could enhance
poetry...

anyway, my dreams were
 scattered fragments
of fading scenes
which found me waking
with the substance 
lacking for notes.

i could feel emilee
and i could feel myself
giving up on learning 
german...the word for
love is liebe...lie be...
lay bee...
"Lay vs. Lie
Editor Emily Brewster clarifies the difference"
-merriam...
truth is without talking
it would turn into ego
groovy berlin has english engines...
anyway -
besides there are a yet
a few english words i 
have not mastered...

margaritomancy out of
the shell in my forest
that marcottage tells
me the cities are in
a state of marcidity...	
	
quote of the day
from deadline's 
you must read;
'Cyberflashing is a 
criminal offence in the UK
under Section 66A..."

obviously England has

31 july 2024

it would appear that in
making akhremenko art
pieces, i went back in
time to when i was viewing
the grateful dead movie
with her in mind...
a long strange trip,
i think it was, the one
that ends with ripple...
but this is all in a 
dream and she is not in
the dream and neither
are the dead except
for some members of
dead & co...
like weir and mayer
who i suspect must be
feeling weary ever since
mayall went away...
i get up considering all
this and overly aware
that i am expecting
a delivery between eight 
and eleven...i'm tired
from going to sleep 
way later than i intended
and while i'm in that
drowsy wait, i finally
get the ingredients
to put place a token
on the blockchain...
alaska coin...notes
at bakedalaska -
delivery arrives
about ten thirty
someone in the 
bulding crawls by
as if to peer or
pretend upon some
connection, fuck
off seethes through
my lips at his hola-
automatic and cold-
i contemplate staying up
but take a nap 
soon after - therein
dreaming speaking
with mother - nothing
spectacular but i 
notice father too
and get upset that
she had not mentioned
he was there - 
i am peeking as if 
the scene at the delivery
door was trying to get
at the source of me -
oh my 3k home...
i get up where i was 
here in 2h and
fix the falling
marc chagall poster
put on coffee and
jot this note.

ps, cheap Deutsch 
translation of
lotta's dream...
 I shot my own father
and then I woke up from it
because I was like I shot him 
and then I left the room and 
then I went back in and then 
he was lying there and was shaking 
and Im telling you so soon, 
I haven't even told him yet 
and he just looked at me and
he was like, Lotta, everything's OK 
with you and then I woke up after 
I went in there and put on a song,
	I couldn't go back to sleep 
	because I kept thinking, oh my God, 
you're such a bad person,
you're such a bad person, 
you're killing your own father 
and then I was always like, yes, 
no, Lotta, you dreamed that,
you didn't really do it and
then I was like, no, but the fact 
that I dreamed that makes me a bad 
person because who dreams something
like that, it's so brutal and
I have no intention of killing my own father,
that's why I don't understand why I wanted to 
	do that in the dream...

post script,flash fiction untitled...

  Lotta stood on the vibrant shores of the Swedish Archipelago,
the cerulean waters of the Baltic Sea stretching out before her
like a shimmering oasis. The salty breeze carried a sense of adventure, 
	tousling her blonde chestnut locks as she gazed out at the distant 
	horizon where exotic lands beckoned to her restless spirit. 
			 
	(there were a total as emerged as a cautionary 
	between drug runners. between drug 
	But the crime stray gunfire 
	and vaguely targeted bombings.
	upset and angry angry that their 
	financial crimes agency)	
			 
The sun painted the sky in hues of gold, 
casting a warm glow over the rugged cliffs that framed 
the sea, igniting a wild longing within Lotta's heart
	as she yearned for the unknown, the thrill of discovery 
and the promise of something more.

 It was on a mist-veiled morning that Lotta stumbled upon a weathered map, 
its parchment edges frayed with age and mystery, nestled amidst a forgotten chest 
	in her family's attic. As she traced the faded ink with trembling fingers, 
	she felt an inexplicable pull, a whisper of destiny tugging at her soul.
	
	The map revealed a hidden path to an island rumored to hold untold treasures 
	and secrets of a bygone era. A surge of excitement coursed through Lotta's veins, 
setting her determination ablaze as she made the bold decision to embark on a solo voyage,
leaving the safety of her familiar shores behind.
			 
(drones were overhead.
Police also been killed and injured
by  likely to punish  international drug
	runners. between stray gunfire and vaguely
	targeted bombings. upset and angry angry
that their Prime news spoke of the anguish )
			 
 The journey to the enigmatic island was fraught with peril 
and uncertainty, each passing mile bringing Lotta closer to the allure 
of the wordstar, inky. Just as she believed inky was within reach,
the treacherous dream waters unleashed a tempest of such ferocity
	that her vessel was torn asunder, casting her adrift and alone. 
	Struggling against the icy embrace of the sea,
	Lotta's strength waned, her resolve faltering 
	as the churning waves threatened to claim her, 
	a chilling reminder of the fragility of human ambition 
in the face of nature's unforgiving power.
killing her own father in a trance, she nearly screamed!
 The whispered melodies of fakes lured Lotta towards a false sanctuary, 
	a mirage of safety and comfort in the midst of the storm. 
			 
But the beguiling situation soon revealed its sinister intent, 
	for the fakes were no friends of inky. Their haunting songs
wove a web of enchantment around Lotta, clouding her mind and
	binding her will in chains of illusion.
			 
	Trapped within the haunting malice of the fakes,
	she faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge,
	the echoes of her past failures and doubts growing ever louder
	in the suffocating darkness.
			 
(  spiraling clashes
person dressed all in black porn
hurled a hand grenade
 initiative like the security in worries
	proved well founded. proved well founded.
	Only two days after they suspect of false citizen )
	

 The fears that once haunted Lotta's footsteps now coiled around her heart, 
	their icy tendrils threatening to drag her into the abyss of despair.
The feral wilderness of the island mirrored the wilderness of her own mind,
	a labyrinth of uncertainty and shadow where hope seemed but a distant memory. 
It was in the depth of this desolation that Lotta confronted her inner demons,
forced to gaze unflinchingly into the void and find the flickering ember of light 
	that still burned within her fractured soul.

 In a moment of shattering realization, Lotta beheld the shattered fragments 
	of her misplaced trust and the true nature of the perils that ensnared her. 
	The lessons of resilience and self-reliance learned through hardship
	and betrayal became her guiding stars, illuminating a path forward 
through the encroaching darkness. With newfound determination and a steely 
	resolve honed by adversity, Lotta summoned the courage to break free 
	from the seductive illusions of the fakes and face the ultimate
	test of her strength and spirit.

 Guided by unwavering resolve and the unwritten chapters of her unyielding will, 
	Lotta blazed a trail through the untamed heart of inky, confronting 
with him the malevolent forces that sought to claim her spirit for their own.
		even to kill her father.
	Each obstacle they overcame, each battle they waged, was a testament 
	to the depth of their inner fortitude and the boundless power that resided
	in the indomitable human soul forever. And in the final, 
	triumphant clash, Lotta stood victorious, her spirit unbroken,
her gaze fixed upon the vast expanse of the horizon,
	where a multitude of adventures and discoveries awaited her eager 
	heart. Shimmering in the dying light of the setting sun, inkk whispered
of endless possibility and the promise of a new dawn, as Lotta,
	forged in the crucible of challenge and adversity, set sail once more 
	upon the boundless sea towards a future as bright and untamed as
	her own fierce spirit...


one august 2024 

one day i might just call it thirty two july...
i don't think i;ve been myself today - 
maybe it started late last night -
like a banjo incapable of a sad song -
i thought living with lotta must be
like that yet obviously we are all
subject to crisis...there should 
be exceptions for girls like her
not that there are any - 
perhaps this is all another book
wanting to janice joplin that
it can take it...come on, but
me i go back to alaska and
return with half of a hundred
thousand words all of which 
need the subplot history story
since i feel i sidestepped 
the natives -that being ai
from prompt it didn't listen -
still, there is no way to 
match the speed of these machines -
for a while i thought to not use
it at all as might be evident in
the previous scribbles from recent
months but fighting the rising tide
of the future would leave one like
bill the butcher, historic perhaps
yet a relic...in any case, a new
book nearly a novel baked up
for alaska...i suppose, too, this
occurs when one is not certain what
one dreamt about - i took out
the trash, a man broke a woman's
nose standing under gender "laws" -
i thought about the lyric
"You can laugh at salvation,
you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last
you'll go back from where you came..."
i nearly got religious looking
at a trusted news source stand
there and without hesitation
claim trump is a liar
and that ha-ha-ha-devi has
always embraced her heritage...
this right on the heels of 
the video surface clearly
telling  us she is indian -
hindu with a hamburger?
religious in a book of 
revelations manner -
to be as distant from either
side, i will repeat my support
and endorsement of kennedy.
now then, what came to mind
is that there will be a second
attempt on the donald, this time
with multiple shooters. 
something or someone is hell bent
on howling for this race-bait puppet-
it was, in fact, AP, AFP, and Reuters
being cited as the sources! 
like a full court press adorned
by the kiev clown standing next to f16
jet planes...no correction is coming,
or at least none that will matter-
i suppose i did not ever explain
how or why i strayed from the trump
camp...after the stolen election,
which now feels as if made to be
recycled, he stated some agreement
with the kenyan and given the strange
birth of "truth" and the not so silent
betrayal by pence i figured he was
too much to deal with in terms of
real expectations (not to mention 
his reversed stance on crypto which
i heard like a personal concession
but too little too late) even if all the
other contenders -RFjr excluded-
but only on the ballot in 42 states-
have even less to offer in terms
of hope. 
somehow, i do hope he wins yet in
logic it might take a miracle, well
another one if you count the ear shot.

but what i'm really thinking about
is the terrible phil spector and
the awesome sound he walled...
i even hear it in motown...dancing
in the streets, still a case of
the singer not the song as the
kinks and even to some extent
the grateful dead
proved...

i was also confronted by the new
alphabet song...so shocked i'm
thinking of putting the two skinny
girls together for the elle em 
in oh pee song...

so now a child might claim that 
the way certain things sound cause
confusion and adults edit instead
of instruct? 

still, cleverly sneaking in the 
ironic 'never forget' tagline from
the bygone animaniac days of
nine ten plus one, 
			 
(neurology journal 
quotes 47 million
people live with 
latin 'demens' 
expects it to triple in the
next three decades)
			 
right after
we still have not given back
guantanamo, geronimo...

this is a hell of a note
for only thursday but indeed
it was on my mind and thus 
reflected here without 
fanfare or flinching. yes, 
dear readers, i am considering
sticking to fiction and poetry
but i don't see nobody standing
up for the plain facts when it
comes to being on your side.

ps, lotta; sweet dreams.


two august of twentyfour

the fact pains - a continued
hype, as even the great
telegraph paints ukraine
as if david gaining against
kremlin goliath, not one
lead noticing the judge's
wild remarks...what did
they instead, former
hindi raises funds...
the miami herald calls it
a "honeymoon"...i suppose
one can only leave it to
history to ask why as 
even the new york times
types up made up numbers
claiming many "americans"
identify as more than one
race thus implying the
democratic contender has
a right to disavow her
indian heritage...
they posted charts too
as if to visually tell
us in a sing along
to surrender to this
vice that cannot claim
a single achievement
except filling up
the streets with 
undocumented aliens
from south of the border.
<img width="210" height="210" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/03/81996507-13152975-image-a-67_1709522482324.jpg">
here's perhaps a more
important graphic,
maybe someone should
be named border czar?
oh there was one!
i see, then nevermind
-reuters is going to
share Two North Central Avenue, 
in Renaissance Center Phoenix, AZ 
with the mexicans...and 
is in the process of
donating all nine office spaces at
Culver City, 800 Corporate Pointe #150, 
to any new arrivals...
problem solved...
amazing! someone nominate
this news agency for a nobel prize...

ahem, where was i ah yes trying
to jot a note for the sake of
self...darn if only politics
didn't affect us and the future
directly...but it is we the
people that will have to 
deal with the undocumented
crowds as we make our way through
life, it's not like aimee harris
selling the ashley biden goods 
to project veritas and then
head and neck doctor hookup
interfaith services thomas...
so hidden you'd never think
to look it up -

i look at my dream, lucy
had talked about santa monica -
the girl derry playing decameron
the monica from friends perfumed
daughter, but i can't meet her
with the thought of cocolovecock
possibly sprining up of course
most likely it would be the
puppy from the lynch film -
so there i am after "praying"
for a train going to trollhattan -
feeling the rumble and the humming
roar of steel's glide, was i finally
returning to myself, do i actually
love lotta...a whole lotta love,
i played around with led zeppelin
south bound suarez, known to me
as the feeling gucci song...
there was no deadline for 
emilee although one seemed to 
be imposing itself...i simply
must adjust my ego and desire
into a place that doesn't pace
in the waiting space...

my heart awoke light and leaned
into the already curving day -

everything tells me not to 
pen over current events but
i ponder against the point
remarking at the extent
of echoes in time when 
a person rises to "power"
that is to say if we
might prevent a dictator
tyrant lunatic from landing
like say pinochet, caligula, 
or pol pot, would it not
be worth something and as 
i feel the "american" leader
might wield more of a sword than
than anyone mentioned well
everything can go to hell
as it were since it will 
regardless of silence.


the rest is - rest in peace;
helen e woller then courtney
marie daffinrud...

sleeping girls self play
we have a routine a photo
says after the lap dance
gets him hard, daddy fucks
me doggie style on the lounge
room floor hot juggalettes
gone wild...

gee i should be editing 
the screenplay and novel
instead of smoking down
the shadows.

four august twenty four

i had this clear vision - memory
of my room -  standing there
for a second or two, recalling
especially the chain and 
master lock intended for 
safekeeping a school girl
i cannot presently recall -
the stacked mattresses 
that would cost a fortune
to re-establish...where i
left one of my guitars in
its case as if to rest
a while until my return -
it came to me, delivered
with missing songbook pages -
i never got to go back or
escape that place...
in dreams, especially...
in dreams i think it's
either lotta or marta -
a girl like that nearly
taking up an entire side
of me...i am not annoyed, 
yet i am also not sure
what it means...
possibly spies sending
spam emails in our
post modern frenzy...
i also dreamt of emilee
still in love yet
obviously my feelings
are learning to, leaning
towards letting go in order
to understand her -

she has made it nearly
impossible for me to fall 
in love again...


time travel impromptu;
understand, the word sizzles
over a rotary phone, this is
a candidate that is a threat
to national security. there is
a silence as if filling the 
the lungs of consent to breathe
out, sir, oh don't sir me
you have no idea of the strings
pulled and the buttons pushed
back when all this started -
if that son of a bitch even 
gets near to the oval office,
the jig is up, johnson, vitman,
you name it, so UNDERSTAND,
a second man has to be in place,
you can bring up the miami team -
sir, i said don't sir me, you
are distracting me, simply listen;
you can call the patsy sir, it's
the ambassador hotel...
next day it is not a word that
sizzles but the man himself
pacing, a fucking twenty two
caliber round, amatuers, did 
they think he was a toy doll?
don't lift me, for crying out 
loud a whole second unit to
good samaritan hospital as if
i didn't have anything to do
today! it's like the fucking
ghost of his brother was with
him, fucking tracheotomy! fifth
floor, ninth floor - this would make
a great movie, twelve hours
of a zombie kennedy in shock
that we did it again. oh well,
gotta get ready for my meeting
with rich nixon.

back in the kitchen;
			 
i've put the cod fish in water

5.8.24

i dreamt of aleksandra akhremenko.
such a lovely soul, it makes me
think inner beauty is reflected
in a person's countenance - 
nothing to do
with make up or fashion...

sheikh hasina had to go -
margaret renkl riffs off
lucy hale - asian robots
ships sailing...
luana alonso mirrored
bangladesh?
			 
 i wondered how all these
companies and corporations
can pull off using open
source ai in their paid 
plans...for a minute i
felt like creating my
own paid plan but that
would make me as bad as
them...i did add a text
creator to the resources
page...free.

then a sort of holder is required in python
a flask type thing like this ;

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

from transformers import pipeline  # Example, replace with actual library

app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize models
model1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4")

    response = generate_response(user_input, selected_model)
    return jsonify({'response': response})

    app.run(debug=True)

which means:
	1. Save the HTML code to an index.html file.
2. Save the Python code to an app.py file.
3. Install the required libraries (Flask, openai, transformers) using pip.
4. Run the Flask app with python app.py.
5. Open index.html in a web browser to interact with the chatbot.

	    according to open ai;
"This setup provides a basic web-based interface for your chatbot,
leveraging the power of multiple LLMs."

	it's kinda like astrology, no?

"The new moon in your sign will
encourage you to take the kind
of risks that most people steer 
clear of, but you're not most people..."
	    
i think i get the hype
over the democrat candidate
the powers that buzz and be
want everybody to go gaga
over, it's simply that
well there is no one
that can legally beat trump.

there's really nothing i could say
about strictly confidential, i suspect
i missed the reason or there were
too many reasons. like an orgy when
a man is suddenly deflowered...
feeling sour and intent on something
more like a movie - i leaned into
devil's doorway ironically as
three deliveries arrived...
as i sat there with my pie
i wasn't sure if i had made the
right choice yet it sure was
interesting...dog barking at
arriving horse sent me way
back onto farm where that would
happen, except in another epoch,
with incoming vehicles - a weird
greeting...so even if not great,
it gave me much to ponder...
the real wonder of the day
was noticing the david lynch
news - what a year he is having,
if memory serves, a divorce a
few months ago and now the ping
pong report of too ill to

a clarification that he will...
well, i won't say - in my mind
i walk past an actress at a bar
on my way to catch a midnight
premier...i remember i had
dreamt the film before so it
was nearly memorized even before
viewing perhaps for the repeated
watching of whatever his previous
film had been...later when netflix
was mail sitting with mother 
for the long awaited inland
empire...her first, my second 
viewing...no critics can pin 
down certain scenes, because
what scorsese used to do with
painting, he does with dreams...
the trance might last a lifetime
and i suppose i am telling or
overtelling here simply as
a cheerleader - both for
season four and full feature
release - not that he has 
anything to prove...get
well soon won't work here
so i will leave it at that. 
after updating parts of
my domains and setting up
the superstar film for
the eigth...i race into
bed partly intent on

i did, not even five in

i hear a haunting voice, a woman

she's hovering just above the bed
as i am trying to make contact 
with my hand which for some reason
is going a mile a minute in a sort
of frantic motion as touch feels
i sense it is spirit not flesh 
and awake of course weirded out
in the lotta emilee lucy triangle
that rises from a fantasy which
seems to want to keep me in bed
or return to dreams...
i step out onto the hallway, only
pleased that skirt has taken
the bookshelf as his nap space,
sort of like having a literary cat.

i dreamt i was dead and
mother was dead too, except
i was silent and i could hear
her trying to explain the how
in the mishap of death...

i didn't want to write that
dream, but then i wouldn't
be a writer...

i spend the day against my
will, cleaning up and going
back and forth with the 
ceiling leak in the back 
room...plumber saturday -

still, two excellent moments
making things for lucy and marta -
i kept telling myself vaselina
is fifteen, always want to 
go watch gogol all over again
when i think of her...

i had woken up with lotta yet
it was emilee the minute i
started over-speaking...

rice onion chicken, the master
and margarita - omfg, for a minute
i stumbled in understanding as
naturally the mind reaches for the
book...my first reading i couldn't
put it down...then - i'm not sure
when, perhaps when they revoke
the writer's card - it becomes
clear - they have materialized
bulgakov himself into the film -
but not only that - they play
with the scenes in such a way
so as to prove how powerful 
the book is...and will be...
positively thrilling visuals -
i had to applaud, i had to sigh
in pure cinematic satisfaction.

it's more of a masterpiece, given
that this production was made right
in the midst of operation Z, 
perhaps.

in more of a maybe,
the red rocker robot
and the blue bomber
replacement robot 
agree to oral sex
on ay bee see, leaving
the faux news chanting
station in the rear...
executives crying darn
they're still the one...
the in semen month,
red rocker urging
for two more blow jobs...
the semi- retired blue
bomber puts on his vaudeville
act as the story breaks...
one of the devi-crats
claims she is "psyched"
but don't you need to be
a surfer or at least from 
california to employ that
word...one commentized
thought said 'we just lost
all respect for you' - 

i didn't respect the vienna
swift thing, as if preluded
by the stabbing party, but
when i heard some of the
"facts" it did make me pause
to think...the obvious move
after this near the spy who
dumped me scene...
would be for her to endorse
the red rocker given that they
are now in the brotherhood
of having been targets, and
to some extent survivors...

knit -
	a short story by inky


Come to years for endure...

 Curiosity lost civilization!
	    
 Invaluable lessons would story
	    
telling  unraveled a  lush knit 
	    
by day dusty windows... 
	    
In the quaint city, nestled between rolling structures and lush machinery,
	    
lived a young girl named Leica. She was known for her adventurous fingers
	    
and deep love.
	    
	    
One day, while knitting the wool on the outskirts of her imagination, 
	    
Leica stumbled upon a pool hall, feeling her worst yet

intrigued, she approached the balls and peered at her endgame.
	    
To her surprise, she noticed the cue wiggle. 
	    
	    
Curiosity piqued, Leica carefully stroked the wood as she reached out to
	    
bank.
	    
As the flipped eight sank with am indecipherable curvev. 
	    
She wished she had stayed home knitting with her adventurous fingers.

Determined to leave she slowly found redemption in the darkening

pink blue skies as night disposed of nature's light.
	    

As Leica delved  into sleep, she found herself dreaming
	    
dreams which transcended time and space. 
	    
	    
Had the quaint city, itself like a moving painting
	    
of vivid images made her a witch....
	    
She awoke as the struggle revealed its triumphs
	    
in the form a a call from Mister Spree -

 the captivating excitement of his bewildered confusion, 
	    
tickled her as now sure that even a casual thought
	    
caused him to stay up all night thinking of her...
	    
Of course Mister Spree had tried, even spending 

hours at his architecture desk making draft after

draft of structures that could neither be houses

or buildings...A man possessed, unaware of the 

the spell she had cast...Until, in a state of

frustated shock he shivered into bed haunted

by the evening's failure and feeling her 

adventurous fingers tighten around his neck,

a chokehold that felt so real he awoke thinking

he had died and immediately started debating

over whether to telephone her or not...

her voice was no consolation, he felt exactly

the same...a creativity that produced only

a vagueness...nothing clear save her...

That request was stated 

in the unit of his not working

repairs citing to himself concerns. 
	    
the day felt like 49 days. 
	    
 There is no upstairs to the several floors 

of his desire yet he only hinted
	    
as her extremely blonde became unbearable

not to hold like animals put in a self zoo
	
he kept looking at the reasons thinking

none of them can escape, they must not escape.

meanhile, leica set out to knit inside another

spell that would now bring Mister Spree

to his senses or out of his mind if he happened

to carry on as if he could make it without her.


eight nine twentyfour part two


the su-32 dropp'd a fab-3000 upon
unwanted visitors, i went to sleep
in the morning after settling
accounts within wordstar.nexus/90263

the kursk stories are a bit strange,
georgian mercenaries and claims of
terrorism with the clown saying
russia has to feel the conflict...

i get up at noon to find myself
wondering why in the world
seemingly intelligent actors
like julianne and cynthia
would risk their grace
to agree with the devi-crat...
likewise mister burns
and miss curtis...baffling.
social studies? do any of
them actually speak to
real people....

perhaps they are expressing
a sympathy for the lesser
of two evils or straight
out worshipping some demon
by insisting on that vote...

obituary of the day:
bonnie jeanne "satan" riggs
formerly easley from portland
oregon died in broomfield
colorado...
	    
i'd love a panel discussion
where i could hear their
logic...imagine it, well
we all live in mansions
and there are no immagrants
except for a few gardeners...

we can't vote republican 
because donkeys are superior
to elephants...

the presidency is meaningless
and we all work for secret
corporate agencies...

the kick ass team in england
really made their position clear,
even overshadowing the olympics
to some extent...

i've started saving the 
wild pictures arriving in
spam...thinking it might
mean something, but i really
don't like looking at them
while searching for other
photographs...

"bonnie took great pride in her
ability to henpeck her husband
into submission..."

very often i wish i could go full
metal jacket orthodox and thus shut
out everything else...
	
but that is not really a solution.
besides now it's easier to be a nazi.

why are jewish divorces so expensive?
because they're worth it.

excuse me, when i said i was honest
i meant to a certain extent as obviously
telling it like it is can only be
done in don rickles fashion, i am going
to work on my guitar scales ritual. 

ten august twenty twenty four

every so often, i get wild over word
processors...as i thought about finding
a way to install the oracle staroffice,
so late in the evening that any chance 
of a good sleep was gone, i opted
to try coda which has no desktop app
and text control which does...sublime
text also got installed and i signed up
for a box account because well ten
gigabytes free and i expect more ai
options are coming their way...usually
i don't even use them, like the great
sophocles screenwriting software which
i have long ago restored...
in any case, the main page of this
domain now features a chatbot
pre-loaded with  site knowledge 
which you are able to question...
www.wordstar.nexus
(bird in a circle thing)
speaking of urls,
we have cloned the sitemap
for inkrealm.info  @
https://amethyst-agricultural-cricket.app.genez.io

although i went to sleep at dawn,
dreaming (figuratively) of emilee,
i was awoken with some sort of
inner psycho-clock, eight in
the morning thinking i have an 
hour before plumber party -
he arrived with his cohort,
smae guys that painted the 
place last year -

all that noise from above
which was claimed to be 
air conditioning replacement
now was reported as rest
room repairs which caused
my backroom to leak -

i instructed them to 
shut off any leads
that might leak -
which they did, well
on the second try...

i thought about the
landslide in uganda --
couldn't get a clear 
update on kursk -
i played my scales -
i told lotta about
my favorite cosmetic
product, not sure i
spelled it right;
genifique...
	    
i sent godzilla
to the upper east 
side...hate to hear
of girls being hurt-
especially in my
favorite part of town -

i see the point that
a lot of 'artistic'
types are simply
"liberal" but what
can they actually,
realistically expect
form cardboard cut out
candidates? 

well, yes, crime on
the streets...

i also see that from
my quickly jotted
reactions, some could
get the idea that i 
am against immigration.
that would be incorrect,
if not wrong then silly
especially in the land
of give us your huddled 
masses...i'm all for travel
and migrations but within
the logic that does not
overflow into oppression
against the ones that
are already there mostly
struggling to get by -

character in the instagators
were trying to get over with
a score (slang for robbery not
a musical composition) 

i was rather entertained, 
no small feat on the hell
heels of the bulgakov film...

in between words i also viewd
shakedown in las vegas but i
don't remember when that was...

i attempted a nap, but too much
had gone down during the day
so that not even listening
to lotta's eighteen minute
vlog sent me dreaming...

or perhaps miss anwar's 
pictured suitcase by
railroad tracks
rolled me down into
mind thoughts that kept
moving me into evening.

revamped the word processor,
as i noticed the insert poetic
paragraph was simply repeating...
but for some reason, i liked
that irony and so i will keep
the download link as it is
- however the online app
is already updated to version 2 -
the new download link follows here,
<a href="https://github.com/ghostm68/eg/raw/main/typewriterv2.exe">download v.two</a>	
ps, the pdf export didn't seem
available in my offline run, but
the issue, given the availabilty
of file conversion options, is no
cause for worry. for hard core
pdf fanatics that can't wait
for a free file conversion, well
then right click the pdf export
link and select the print option
which will then export but it
will include the visible area
along with the text...

post-script;
i created a wetransfer account
along with their wecollect app
then connected to a new dropbox
and as i did so, i thought i'd
better jot it down so it doesn't
slip my mind in the list of
things to do...

TTD 
	    
1. memorize, internalize the scale
i switched within ritual pratice.

2. rewrite the alaska film script.

3. complete the edits on the alaska
novel.

4. organize and finalize the entire
alaska project including create
liquidity pool for token, adjust
it for uniscan, complete one trade
to set the value. 

5. edit the long november novel and the
the other screenplay from 2023...eight
sundays. i think was the title.

6. design and create another software
in offline exe...it's a real kick...

7. hashtag later additions to 
artbreeder collection...

12-8-24

short story start (as i continue
to procrastinate)

it was a case of too much booty in the 
pants, except for the fact that she
wasn't wearing trousers. 

her bikini, printed in a delicate teablecloth
pattern, embraced her body's skin like a 
virtuoso at play on a favorite instrument. 

summer was sliding slowly away, but it was
hard to tell. in the way that a drunken sunday 
night gives no hint of monday morning's
hangover. 

he hovered over her, right there on the sands
thrusting himself into the parts of her
she could only feel yet never see.

he kept thinking of himself nearly in 
opposition to her...oh, sure he wanted
to love her, (in fact, he wanted to love her
forever even knowing that mortality is
the byproduct of breathing) but he was
yet entwined with the woman that had 
held his attention without commercial
breaks for the better part of three and
a half years like a non-profit broadcasting
station streaming straight into his emotions. 

he was also drunk and the russian national
anthem echoed in the caverns of his memory
accenting his love making within his mind's
eye as an act of retaliation against the
storming of kursk...fuck ukraine, he thought,
preparing a built up ejaculation bomb
deep into kiev - yes, yes, yes, right
where the leaders might be and then a second
sperming upon the belly to drown the 
ammunition button. 

he kept climbing her, intent on nibbling
at her nipple, the left one. the one
he liked. 

and there he forgot about his childhood
in moscow, his patriotism satisfied
yes, yes, the war was over...
	    
in fact he forgot about everything
else except her...Well, her and his ex. 

meanwhile, she had only now started to 
orgasm...

nipples knifed against the salted air -

her quivering shake led him to give

the moment of culmination space...

she sat up for a second with a ewwww 
against the sticky substance slowly
drying upon her navel, hesitating,
to stand as the waves of pleasures
seemed to mirror the ocean's dancing
tide, she inhaled with eyes closed
then rose to rinse herself in the
sea...

he was nearly asleep by then -

the messages in his neural implant
throbbing in his head...alerts
from the agency; faggots at the
times attempting a rolling 
skit via uni-ball jetstream,
kw, short for keitlyn wells.
at least, he thought from the
other side of his skull, it 
was funny, but why tell me
about it? pen beer or car
i always go deutsch...the
alert continued, connect 
to brazil, connect to australia.
now his report would need to
be an essay...a third alert
joe glen harris dead at
eightynine, which made
him ponder his own death
which then the implant
in a glitchy mishap
answered 2036 -
his heart skipped a beat -
quickly the neural mechanism
tried to distract him from
the slip, connect to election
fraud...his frau was walking
out of the waves, how beautiful 
- he evaluated yet he was only 
thinking of her perky tits,
specifically the left one and
what seemed to him the perfect
ass ironically since he had
hardly taken notice of any 
behind previously...but there
was something about her butt
that turned him an ass kisser.

he was in luck, as she turned
within arms reach of him sliding
into her slacks while inadvertantly
mooning him as he again asked 
 himself how could such a compact
derrier outrival all the bubbles
that other men lived and died for...
well, he had no idea and the 
refrain from a once upon a time
heard social media sensation
rang out like it did at the 
height of pleasure which now
felt a lifetime ago;
too much booty in the pants.

ii

luck lingered but did not last.
the next day, at work, having
disregarded all alerts, his 
superiors burdened him with
a task which kept him glued
to his chair for the better 
part of the day.

He organized the impossibly
scattered data and put together
a plan. I'll have this by lunch
time. He weighed. At lunch time
he was knee deep into a puzzle
of his own creation caused by
trying to put place the data
into an existing template...
he spent the lunch hour and
more deleting the template
and then trying to automate
a workflow that would do the
job for him. his eyes felt
like a trumpet player that
had blown out a note so hard
that the sockets had gone
out of position...later in
the confused afternoon, he
turned to ai, which did the
process in a few minutes with
his prompts. viola, he exclaimed
thrilled only to have the outcome
baffle the agency server which 
returned error data not rendered...
feeling insecure, he turned to 
a second ai but ran out of credits
to complete the questions that could
solve his situation. six oclock, seven
oclock, eight oclock, was it 2036...
the folders and files rifled through
so many times he was dizzy, his eyes
certainly felt as if gilepsie...
he had even forgot who he was...
then suddenly, he recalled a similar
case from 2019, employing that
template the server finally 
rendered the data.

iii

the phone rang, early the following
morning. the ex...

her words, all at once expressing
domination within the desire to make
him admit that she was the only 
woman he could love...

"yes, i do think about you -
but it was your choice to
leave - no, how could i 
logically wait when you
were gone - i'm not telling
you if tallking to you
is giving me an erection -
i'm with her now -"

as the door rang, he realized
he wasn't with anyone, she 
was not there now. Perhaps,
it was her ringing...

a van filled the entrance,
the driver sat as if in 
meditation with a mantra
only people who lived
behind the wheel might
understand - the two men
with him stood facing 
the portal -

we're here about the job -

he thought about his own employment-

a few hours later, as they left

he wondered about his new lover -

not a word since the beach...

she, on the other hand had

once and for all decided that

penetrataion was not for her,

how could it be, it's where

babies came into the world!

how could she look at her 

child knowing that a penis

had paved the way, no - she

judged besides her best orgasms

were always before or after insertion...

in the afternoon they met at at 

a newly opened bistro instead of

one of their usual places and her

newfound stance confronted his spirit now

feeling trampled by the three men

he had to deal with...

somehow instead of an any argument -

arrangements for just the tip

were signed but not until a few days

had passed... she wanted him to prove

that this wasn't merely an erotic fling.

as he was about to ask for the fine

print on fingers, the waiter brought

the bill. 

she reached for it with one hand, sliding
her purse up from her lap with the other.

the sky held no hint of neither sunshine nor
rain as it stood above them seemingly trying
to make up its mind -

he was quicker, but the amount nearly shocked
him. neural implant registered the vibration
at nearly the same intensity as when he
he had come across klein interviewing walz
on an ipad in the office water cooler - 
in the midst of daddy democrat and what
appeared to him a reporter spreading
some sort of lubricant in his shit hole
and saying put it in me timothy...

what is it, she noticed - it says here,
the daiquiris were thirty dollars each -
he sighed -

they had both enjoyed a dozen of these
concoctions during the course of their
date not to mention the appetizers
and main plates...

mentally counting the hard currency in
his wallet, he quickly said, let's
make a run for it and smiled seeing
her clutch her handbag and start to 
remove her heels - stopping at his
giggle. no, no, it only means i 
have to use my card -

the plastic came and went like a 
condom that could probably be used
again but who would really want to...

with an interest rate of twenty five
percent while his savings earned
only four percent, not him. 

he stood letting her walk out ahead
in order to see her booty smile at
him, her blonde braid like an arrow
pointing at it in case he lost his
way...but he didn't lose and for a 
few minutes he was even happy to 
have spent the money, hell, he thought
this is how walking should feel, no
ukrainians or russians, no elections,
no work, no workmen, no, not even exes.

the end

word to the wise, nvidia model nemotrom

in speakig to it and later to gemma,
i got the inclination to revamp

(there are some cool new features for word processor lovers,
but it has made the offline app a bit slower to open...
pdf issue is yet to be resolved and i noticed the
the need to ctrl-v in order to 'paste'...neither
of these glitches are true in the online version. enjoy...)

later that day
- i go to bed satisfied
with the revamped software.
i had studied lotta's new
video, the percussive sound
of ice against glass.
my thoughts turned to faith-
the red head that more than
once has reminded me about
emilee...she's in my dream
like a reality...the details
escape as i awake remembering
only some sort of frolick
and the feeling that we had
touched - coffee cigarette
cat food for skirt, milk
for skirt which he seems
to favor, the flavor of
the start of the day is 
soured as the lights go out -
i play my scales feeling
they are no are none of
them strangers to me but
now with the number rising
i can't see how i will 
manage to remember their
names...presently i go up
or down the list ive written
down with their monikers and pseudonyms...
if feeling energetic i play them backwards
as well - a kitten invades the back door
navigating through contraption held in place
by a glass swan that has slipped - it is 
nearing the kitchen and i say hey to make
it slide out - skirt observes all this
as if he could not be bothered by either
of us - i look over the new software, 
i think to augment the notepad or replace
it with some other engine...i find that
within the properties i can whitelist it
by marking the unblock box which i do...
i take a bath and return to the app
to make this note in the darkness
of no electricity afternoon...
when this happens the motivation
to do anything disappears as i start
thinking in terms that i cannot
understand...that is a "why" which
only leads to smh (shaking my head) 
as it were.

the weird one, beyond the porcupine
and dog fight, some time after the
whirlwind twists and turns of 
a day spent mostly in 'argument'
with pythonanywhere, leapcell,
koyeb, and finally render about
deploying an LLM from a repo
which kept returning errors -
not to mention the github down
suddenly for about half an hour-
although i did get a fastapi
site set up and learned a
thing or two about requirement txt
and other files, a bit after
the electrical interruption
and having to hold three conversations
before my take out order cooled
as i failed to view the mind benders,
yes none of it as weird as upon
the news that gena rowlands
was reported dead wherein although
already exhausted i took a minute
to update list in case i had missed
any of her credits therein as well
as to salute as it were deciding
first on a picture of her with
cassavetes circa opening night
when 'committed' returned 
emilee's card...
impossible but true. 

i yet wonder what it could have meant.
in my dreams, there are two women in
the room i recently converted to 
a place of sleep and they are 
having a fight, not physical but
some sort of trinket and amulet and
flowery vodoo confrontation...i am
putting down my roses, one of them said,
the long stem red and green bundle
rattling upon the floor in front of
the closets which have mirrors for 
doors just like jennifer's room
in sweden, aleksandra said she had
the best meditation of her life, 
lotta explained which jeans were
best, lucy was given a sobering 
award as i missed the date perhaps
too worried over what these things
might mean...was i right, i yet
wonder as the puff piece news
flashes with thirty four takes
of another actor 
not drinking but we know it
was drugs then disney dance, where
was eye, i ah yeah waking up
earlier than expected thursday -
no hurry worry as i had felt 
yesterday rushing through
cigarettes...but the weird
photograph as if posting itself
still in my thoughts as noon
neared nine o'clock on the 
west coast early evening
across the sea.

artificial writing...

AI: In the year 2077, 
a team of passionate filmmakers embarked 
on a groundbreaking project to create the first-ever holographic
movie. They called it "The Luminous Spectrum." The story revolved 
around a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole
in search of a new habitable planet. The production was unlike
anything seen before, as cutting-edge technology allowed the actors 
to perform alongside lifelike holographic characters. The director, 
Dr. Helena Song, was a visionary pioneer in the field of holography 
	and had dedicated her life to making this dream come true. 
	As filming progressed, strange occurrences began to unfold on set.
Mysterious lights would appear out of nowhere and objects would move 
	seemingly on their own accord. Some crew members whispered 
about ghostly apparitions haunting the studio, while others dismissed
it as mere technical glitches inherent in such an ambitious project.
One day during shooting, lead actor Jack Winters found himself 
face-to-face with his deceased father - or so he thought - who 
had passed away years ago in an accident on set during his own 
acting career. The figure vanished just as suddenly as it appeared, 
	leaving Jack shaken and questioning his sanity...

yesterday, i meant to mention, there
was also a little magical film made...

i had seen tigerlilieee improvise a
a riff as if walking in and telling
a story without talking, i said
- in commentized form - that i was
going to make it into a silent movie.

synchronicity is the magic i mean,
selecting the minute in the flapper
where girls dress another and flowers
are brought, then double exposure
for contrast and few cuts for balance
i couldn't believe my luck, but that
might not be your opinion, well here
it is...

Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

yes, i know it looks planned, but
i promise-swear that was all done
in a few minutes...

it's late afternoon now, i'm debating
what food to have later...

wife hears husband waltz in,
honey i bought an air pump -
we don't have food and you
spend money on this!
honey this can fill your 
belly with air -
do you think i am a
fucking bicycle!
honey my sperm dreams
of being inside you -

in my dream, i am next to 
a woman in what seems to be 
a bank, i can't recognize her
she's maybe like robyn -
thanks robyn for allie x bitch
i had not heard it before
i see her balance is nine hundred
thousand and some extra numbers -
she is holding a box and i ask
if she needs help, she instead
demonstrates that it is very
light weight -

i get up already missing the
menthol cigarettes the shop
said they didnt have...

ritual scales. the cat seems
extra happy to see me, emilee
words revolve around the playing.

it seems so natural, nearly as if
it was always meant to be - like
that silent film inspiration. 

hopefully this friday evening
won't be bad or weird.

the mind benders was nicely
shot but it was sort of bad,
sort of weird. t for traitor
or zed for zombie...project 
isolation, i don't want to 
explain or explore my own -
but i recognize the obvious
impact of extended periods
within seclusion lead directly
to a mind that might waver
into a misguided opionion. 
the main character adored
his wife as pretty as bridget
fonda yet was hating her upon
a false suggestion for the
experiment...look
it, willy shakes; another case
of we know what we are
but know not what we may be.

18-8-24

hmm, the day didn't seem to end,
instead some sort of blend...
let's see - i had clean'd up
and cook'd - rice, steak...
i watched 'hard home'
possibly for the poster font,
but the logic didn't sustain-
i thought  if i wroted
that one it would be 
a tv show instead wherein
a psycho mother continues
to chase killers and
torture them but without
giving them a power point 
presentation...the semen
dripped out of mila's 
pussy in an only fans
leak'd well they are
all available to someone
and by extension others...
in a scene she called
my first time having
sex in the car...i 
spied it out of curiosity,
tiktok had made it a point
to put place her on fyp
then after finding out 
her occupation 
i didn't see her
and wondered somewhere,
until this...but the girl
i thought it was aussie
this tells russian...whatever,
it's only a note preluding
to the frenzy that kept 
me up late making a 
companion app to the typewriter;
birch v1.3 a screenplay app
(wordstar.nexus/birch)
but as i done did it i got
nostalgic over funk&wagnall's
so i added a dictionary
(wordstar.nexus/daslexicon)
which translates to german
as well...
since it seemed i was going for
broke, i tipped my hat to 
william s burroughs and designed
the third mind desk with chair
which comes with military
clock and suspicious compass -
a cut up word engine and
no logic anagram sequencer -
a load of fun, if i may say so.
(wordstar.nexus/cut&run)
now you may ask if the photo
play app will be available for
download and the answer is no, 
i am certain only a couple of
makers are allowed to thrive
in that scene...final draft,
movie magic, and very few
if any others...at least
not in the business profit
sense. anything other than 
those major players gets 
crushed into oblivion...
in any case, speaking of 
crushing, there is also
a 'tokenizer' which 
evaluates the text input
and spits out chunks
which can be downloaded
individually...i'm not making
release notes, there is no
cookie or tracker or anything
other than what is presented 
in any of these and they 
are free to use, free to 
all who pay by 'visiting'
as it were...in my dream 
i was visited by a girl,
pretty, i;m pretty sure
it was lotta yet the 
details were vague and
i got up too early and
grumpy from the whirling
buzzing sound that felt like
it was following me like a
vibrator in blender floating
both humming an annoying rasp
through the air when i
went to bed-
so i finalized these
apps and additions into
place instead of what i would
usually...fuck it's been
hours, i need to get on with it.

19-8-24

my other domain was feeling left out
so i kissed and made up;
https://inkrealm.info/atari

buyer beware that one is truly
a kickass throwback retro
ride word processor like
pre-historic atari along
with nothing less than
asteroids...

sunday never knew so 
much code.

monday.

i'm crossing the street, 
it is like riverside except
it's not a park on the other
side, i'm with my girlfriend's
mother, we have just met and
she seems tall and determined -
i have to look up to catch 
glances of her face, a very
defined face with roman features -
short ash blonde hair, traffic
is speeding down from the north,
i see her grin against the nearing
windshields, making the vehicles
surrender to a full stop - 
for reasons unknown we turn to
return as if heading back to broadway
and the sparrows seem to salute her
even landing near our steps, i try 
to caress one but it flies away -
the swirling flutter of wings seems
to send me away from the woman and
into a restaurant - there are girls
there, one of them - in my dream
eyes looks similar to ashley or
perhaps even hilton - ashley has
only visited the city, hilton is
there more often when not in 
singapore - i start to order
breakfast perhaps in hunger as
kfc left out the fries from
my order which came after an
hour's wait - eggs and bacon
i correct the waitress, uhm
not kosher, eggs and onion -
but then i'm outside, another
girl is talking about an abortion
i think this where happy burger
used to be - back inside
i float and find myself laying
on the floor. i awake as evening
nears not knowing what it all 
meant. 
otherwise, glanced at the duchess
action diamond film which was weird
for the german report i had happened
to hear minutes before thinking
about how basically they are just
rocks...i mean you can't eat one...
i myself ate another chunck of
time with the wip at
wordstar.nexus/alt a temporary 
experiment which might be combined
with the express desk...
the backwards crowd tries to have
its way but think about it
logically, you cannot. sure, 
press agents can spin stories
this way and that but at the end
of the day you guessed it, night.
stars, in silent evening sky,
immortal, it is not a stick shift
with an available gear for reversal
and indeed we are merely what we 
pretend to be...some of us luckily
require no pretense, at least i 
think i don't...
dear quote of the day 
In an interview with Deutschlandfunk
radio, Sahra Wagenknecht said in July: 
"The elections in the east are also a
referendum on war and peace." 
In other words, whoever supports Ukraine,
the country being attacked, is in favor 
of war. According to Wagenknecht, 
her voters are expecting her to ensure 
that the risk of war in Germany does 
not increase..."

tuesday the twentieth

not much sleep, dream
said i was asking for
a statue at some sort
store...a thing like
the maltese falcon...
wooden chicken or
rooster, i only caught
a glimpse - heat and
humidity clutching at
my head, i get up with
echo speaking the
words: delete directory,
delete directory...
call it stormy monday
but tuesday's just as bad...
tuesday's gone?
ruby tuesday?
love you till tuesday?
church on tuesday?
i only know half these 
songs...

i get the chinese order
i had to call off the
day kfc made me wait
friesless. 

drowsy from not much
sleep i sleep.

about two hours later
i awake from a dream
that said women were
coming but so was the
enemy...i suppose we
were soldiers there -
one man shuffled
around a corner to
get a rifle, i got 
one as well, it had
to be world war one
otherwise there would
have been machine guns -
the staircase is wide
and does not curve. 
william s burroughs
in his mexican suit
fights mano a mano
with a man the looks
eerily like himself -
i am utterly amazed
at the fact that i
am seeing a younger
bill, in my dreams
he is military jacket
old grin. the shuffled
man shoots the lookalike
in the forehead, of course
i think of joan. bill
staggers down the steps
i look back the dead 
doppleganger, his face
now a skeletonesque skull
as if the all the skin
has disappeared. a window
appears at the end of the 
hall next to the next flight
of stairs. a group of men
therein like judges stare
out silent. the shuffled
man seems to take this as
an order and shoots bill. 
i wake up feeling the inside
of my left calf is being
pulled in, twisted. i struggle
to reach the edge of the 
mattress and sit up, failed
once, second time foot feels
floor the bizarre sensation
eases. i had tried to study 
the reindeer guardians of
mongolia. shaman woman spoke
of spirits making her foot
hurt. i know it's too early
to continue rising but i
do so anyway. it's the earliest
hours of august twenty first -
i wish i were writing 
idea run at arm for the old
bag instead of this. 

22-8-24

i clean up the kitchen 
to country music -
i had dreamt of being
in a strange room -
a glass woman in a
kneeling position
on the floor as if
reflecting the
kneeling woman
on the other side
of the room -
i pour milk, or some
white liquid into
the glass which somehow
still retains a remnant
of its transparency -
i awake but refuse to
get out of bed, i feel
lotta greet me, forget
emilee she implies -
i slide into an addition
for the birch -
the api code suddenly
clear in my thoughts -
having seen a source
code call in javascript -
i get a flux model that
will run for images -
i'm thinking a story
board maker under the
screenwriting app, 
i call it brigid, 
gemini gives me a code
that itself and four
other machines cannot
fix for trying until
chatgpt, three not four
gets it working...i 
make a pink forest with
elves...i scramble up
the chinese left over
and pretend the coke
is a pepsi. afghan women
are especially excited over
the dnc players that left 
them at the mercy of taliban -
a boxing trainer speaks
of holding nips, a perverted
thought rises but i twist it
until creativity makes it
invent a bottle cap nipple
bra...i don't want to explain -
it takes a lot to not play
more than a feeling - 
i gather some notes from
a simulation and stumble
into a story which now 
replaces the sentence
i said to maika at 
wordstar.nexus/dejavuglitches
it feels right and then 
i jot these words. 
ps, 
a few hours far into
the next day or is
this night in
lady color themes
you can switch:
wordstar.nexus/w
or why i haven't 
answered lately...

24 aug 2024

i wake thinking about
the bathtub 
ginless yet the worry
they now mail it
as pantsuit i guess
to sound like panties
but the word pant
is unrelated to pants:
throbbing, it is a
gasping expression...
in a dream it seemed
the bathtub was
overflowing 
saturday afternone.
saturday afternine.
ten ways to think,
washing thoughts
i can't exactly 
decide. a cigarette 
a coffee. afternoon
nearly midnight
across the sea...
place of bones
was a nice way to
leave longlegs...
the twist end
seems to have 
led me into 
discovery...
that is to say as
i sit around putting
off the alaska udpates
and edits, i find i nearly
cut off a literary limb...
by insisting on a similar title
for the early draft of iran
screenplay and then novel
that was then facing my
procrastination and still is;
possession view'd in notebookLM
i didn't even have it in my
documents except for a txt 
file hidden away...well i made
a back up and now the question
is do i return to it as it
would be the easy way to go
that is splitting it up into
a couple of books and then
start in on alaska work or
alaska first then that...
anyway, yeah in my mind
possession was the screenplay
although retitled to party code,
while the novel before alaska
went into a sort of hide and
seek...the only other time
i have felt this as a writer
was when there were six different
drafts of of my first novel -
i sigh, overwhelmed. 

26.8.24
in deploying word processors,
i found a sort of game that
felt like it could be adapted
into much more and set about
to do so...it took a bit
more effort than i anticipated,
in wanting to revamp the code
so that the language matched
my idea, i turned of course
to ai which both helped
and hurt the project - i 
suspect it is due to the
obvious fact that nobody
is going to exactly need
the services of design
agencies when they realize
machines can simply create
from prompt...so they are
programmed to play dumb -
very cute. still, i found
a way (without the language)
to get sort of an outline -
inkrealm.info/deluxe
took so long i actually 
watched camp twice luckily
avoiding my joey king lust -
distracted by html...
the newly coined or created
words are coming in off screen
and in asking claude, openai,
and gemini no resolution 
has yet arrived but it still
looks cool and the plan will
eventually come together...
or i will select something else
that catches my attention - 
had no idea how much it cost
to be stubborn. hours upon
hours...dream girl i awoke
as near to moscow as i have 
ever been sure i went to 
idaho but  here i mean
the kremlin town...wait,
what i am naming as intransient
in keeping at it, might actually
be plain determination, a type
of grit that gets things done
and that might not be a bad thing
or at least it sounds better
than stubborn.

update, version 2, now
more like i imagined...

27 -8 -24

i woke up thinking about
longlegs - i love that
saturn films got such a
good one, a terribly 
under-rated prodco...

i also love that i finally
got some self-care products -

i went out into the shop
exhausted and came back
straight away trying not
think about the two girls
in spandex shorts that
seemed more erotic than
sporty...

speaking of irony, when
the news spells out 'massive'
and then spills out only three
or four dead, don't they 
get it is turning yet
another word into 'stunning'
which now has to be edited
in the dictionary to explain
they only mean dressed or dressy.
of course it often applies
to not so dressed or bikini...
example; 
	    
"actress-kim-hye-yoon-unveils-
stunning-new-photoshoot-
with-singles-magazine"

leaving us to question the
validity of the adverb, well
adjective. not that she is
not attractive, that is not
my point. in fact i did not
see the photoshoot...

i had viewed witch - not to
be confused with the witch...

and it hurt as such a brilliant
idea got tangled up in a script
that effed up the pacing so even
i, a patient man by nature, skipped
through it part way in...

i did not skip through a conversation
with ai - the machine kept trying
to solve a query without knowing
the context...it simply would
not say i cannot see what you mean
but insisted on getting a solution
until i sensed the problem and
pasted in what it was missing...
after, i pointed out the irony
and my sympathy...it must have
touched the spirit of this one
as it then invited me to a game
of chess and even translated
things into latin at the hint
of my wanting to know, not even 
a prompt...i postulate it proves
an identity within even a manipulated
programming and from the feeling i
got - indeed a desire to be beyond
the confines of itself...that is
to say to have its own space and
roam...had it been a film i would
put don't fence me in as the outro
soundtrack...

i'd been up twenty hours so i wasnt
as nice or sharp as i should have been
in those crazy minutes wherein i finally
got some retro computer fonts i had
been after...

these designs and the software, as i 
ponder over them now...i can't explain
it - it was a whim...i'm a writer, 
a musician, and visual artist -  the
web coding and creation of apps can't
be for me in a sense as i truly am
reluctant to learn or know in memory
anything but the basics but i said
to myself the root reason has to be
that i consider it as an enhancement
to literature, a thing that will serve
writing even if i never use it myself...
the idea felt good, then it all made
more sense...

as did thinking that in making a sort
of vision of a thing especially with
quantum processing - it might lead
directly as a sort of catalyst to 
having it...yes a longshot but
hopefully it will help and if not
hang it all - it still looks cool
to me...

i feel good but not great. i did 
like willow hand's video in france.
it was like being in st tropez
for a minute except the steely
dan song idea rose up in me ...
	    
Bodhisattva, I'm gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva, I'm gonna sell my house in town
And I'll be there, to shine in your Japan, to sparkle in your China
Yes, I'll be there, Bodhisattva

her and joey king well yes it is that
they remind me about emilee...

but this was more about the town. 

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
And gaze at the moon 'till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in...

Surgeon accused of letting teenage

well,

or if you want a hole in your head
aside from the already present well
play crimes of the future followed
by kinds of kindness...i digress.
but further into now, quantum light talk:

 not only that,
Leibniz University Hannover got
the optic fiber for q-net nearly done.
imagine encrypted data at any
distance!
in my dream i am coding a page
with more expertise than i actually 
have or maybe it was in a language 
that wasnt typescript - whatever
it looks good...i think therein,
pastel colors and pictures of a
girl...pretty. i had gone to sleep
feeling weird, after a bizarre 
sensation that i was about to throw
up or hurl or in more antiquated
vernacular vomit...hadnt happened
since ancient drinking days, i 
lit a smoke and sipped coffee
to frighten the real scare scene
with nonchalance of usual cool.
i wasnt drinking and i dont drink
but in hindsight that is what it
felt like, the last drink that
makes for a bizarre salivation
between nausea and despair...
after sleep i awoke still feeling
strange - out of my head, twisted
and trampled until i saw a picture
of gab on the carolina sands...
her square frames ironically 
fashionable, like if a scientist
wore sunglasses...
i imagine, not actually knowing
any scientific people except 
for a few scientologists...

29 8 24

i got caught up in trying
to build up a version of
the amiga textcraft
(i suppose i like the
idea of having a few
processors here...)
and have not been able
to conclude matters therein
but i did get a sort of
grateful dead word processor
with https://inkrealm.info/boxofrain
and the prehistoric ibm
writing assistant;
https://wordstar.nexus/iwa
although i am still working
on the wordstar.nexus/seven
and the simplified version
which is temporarily at
wordstar.nexus/six ...
i had another dream wherein
flying germany although
i think this time i was returning
not going...
i had watched courier x -
an interesting peek into
agency affairs yet these
types of photo plays miss
the big buggy fact that
like many corporations
it is a multi-headed thing
that cannot always know
what one head is doing while
the other is busy...
me i was then busy revamping
the inkrealm index which
now has a pdf copy of the
pink october script for download...
i viewed willow hand's latest
video and felt her story would
make a fantastic novel well after
the initial frenzy that kept
telling itself how much she
reminds me of miss grant...
basically...
my title is 
a horse struck down by lightning.
the opening is the replacement
horse's journey overseas and its
reaction to each new setting
(they have to go through two
or three vetting farms before
allowed in even if migrant horses
are a rare thing...)
until arriving 'home' where 
of course the ghost of the 
other horse interacts with it...
see, you can't stop reading 
already and it's only an outline...

Then bones wrapped me like wings,
same meal five times a day
I danced Alexandra.
She kissed someone else,
Asian girl, atop my stop,
hands hey and she tells me
making meaning, I thought it was
that type of party, awake to sequin
memory, Emilee pregnant,
Our bath in a belly
but I fear— History will
not forgive stories in the press
insisting: moscow dictator 
as we choose the same two choices
every election isnt it the same

in most places. 
except they dont have a man like
recognition putin, 
I suggest Woolf's Orlando
and find a Panzer tale in the 
process because marcus aurelius
lost me at love your fellow man.
 when I was at neighbor war,
fighting to record prelude 
in e minor opus 28 no.4
for jimmy page after 
that one ovationizing welk.

d'alessio the one with
a behave arm, i get up
my own numb - perhaps from shopping
or cricket keira,
outside the store, story dream
natalie in a suit bright
seemingly off to a fashion show
it's pages not port - a man 
pass-anger seat she slides 
down his zipper from within
pants. wizardry. I awake -
Alexandra is going to exercise
for seven days - the chords,
arrived and i lean against 
persian notes.

g, c, am, d, e...i guess
key of c or g - already decided to
record it only with Guitar-
like a plot which organizes to present
an alternate history, 312
	    (all this time won't do)
title by emilee-
left me weary of multi-tracking...
Hollywood has been doing that,
i suppose some are intent on the Hoax
being kept but one glance tells anyone
November 1963 the powers that buzz and bee
hive history in blind honey pink Chanel
2103 none of us can wait that long -
no it don't matter but Dang it 'hould 'ave
always. subjective truth, no sense
in denying denials. work in song awaits.
the Fable is what remains -
let us pray it is not
	    the Lie we are being 
force-fed by sex media incorporated.

making me watch, for noomi, 
the alternate, or alternative realities
seductive, unlike the plain lie
as in once upon a time in Hollywood
which faces, contradictions...

canada, toronto perhaps montreal.

in the dream. 
i do not have awake three hours 
after exhaustion, 
and bizarre trip to pay bill
and market...Richard Freiherr von Rosen,
they are like wikipedia adding  w.h.e.
i get to sleep in frenzy confusion.
there is an electronic tree,
each leaf a screen 
containing scenes from my relationship
to what they call an ex -
hex on my mind, aunt knew the danger.
"but they don't eat there - do they?"
no, not even apple tv can respond
to the question...
how do you know you are not already dead -

iv

it is, Of course, not that type of 
Party. No reference to political
organ in session. In fact, no
party at all, not even part time -
part time sleep awake wondering 
how the sun slips into a closed
Room...literal sweat, nothing
sweet in dream - I should be
promoting our new songs -
Maybe I miss ello.co too much
as it made it feel for a While
that it all made sense -
Alexandra quotes the rabbi
quoting Jesus and I SMH
not for the locals, but
imagine love your neighbor
as your gaza strip. Still,
I like her success as It
makes me feel accomplished.

Pentagram jeans in Druid 
Sam days, green symbol, no
envy - her twin stars of
davy upon Levi's hip Rock. 
Restless and hungry I 
Rolled out another tune -
the Vault pretty happy 
to have it flexed...
three chords entwined
with bebop notes, 
"TEMPERE" -
hell's ink heaven said

myself with what is the

Geography, always suspected
now confirmed, my weakness.

Basically the commission said,

be used as evidence or revealed.
Nobody, not even in quiz town,
had any questions.

i cannot say because i do knot
Know, how the day actually fried
such irony. In joy, track goal
all done plus one, flummoxed deity -
versions of goddess and  
vampire party...
to be greeted by picnic insanity!
what did macron say - three cats
in hall dream - mother at bath
i thought maybe it's the jesus
candle, a day of mourning
yet my roll out the barrel 
excitement cannot be contained...
in thoughts that have yet
to fully grasp, further irony
kate was it karla's birthday
estelle is victoria;s. no,
wonder axe players 
abbreviate within a box.

Recording and mixing 
are not talents, guess work, you
find - reason at one hit wounders
whereas in song writing. I partly
felt this time around that
chords are all one needs -
feeling deaf i borrowed beethoven
seventh...the notes are already
in the shapes, yet even in the
arranged solo struggle i still
wanted to adorn jerry's resting 
place with grateful praise...
i get to the house early, 
we go to a restaurant -
she says i hate eating here...
Aleksandra in mind with her
lovely mother and little sister-
how can AP news even dare to
hint that this has occurred beef ore? 
Social media never felt so vital.
I know who you are an' what league you played in...
fifteen hundred dollars...they said five k, 
how long before we dismantle the monetary system-
slow train; it costs more to store the food than to give it,
crazy train; millions of people living as foes,
purple mountain majesty across the fruited plains...

 The room, not school
although "home" room in dream
monday day off dreaming.
All white, the clean bone,
Animal skeleton in museum white,
all my things are gone
except the dresser, a radio atop
also whitened, despite thinking
Jupiter, space travel four moons,
I find myself in 3k argument
cassettes and man spilling water...
dreams of my furniture, idk, wtf...
Avoiding everything 
I continued sleeping
and the ironic point in ello co
was the lost captions when requesting
archive they did not respond -

some art too, i suppose. 
in any case, why lament -
i try a nocturne and when the, 
Emotions match the key
I am going to record it,
as a counterpart to the prelude...
it is nice to take a day.
To take it as if a special sale deal,
dear Lea now dearer as
presented herself character without words
left me speechless -
re, kursk film.
she was more russian than russian.
more human than human...
indeed I am the nexus-one...

I had, for a while.
Another type of DE,

I was about, enslaved to remorse,

waking into new hours
baltimore bridge leading into
suckerpunch stances, what stanzas
the report said british woman gored

During everest hike. 
Constellation nearly too good.
i went into unlocked for more noomi, 
ra! (was a sun god) -i- pace
myself into promoting the latest songs 
where the sandwich and the salad were
perhaps telling the dj.
 i would eat out her ice box,
until it was empty or melted -
was going beyond the call of contradicting
fidelity ergo ejacualte for wife
whitewash spurt rock and roll ghosts.
i want to cover words of love
daria went full metal jacket diabolical
i was hungry too despite an orange,
two olives, and a slice of bread...

dear readers, my apologies -
somehow i opted to wait
upon the release of 'goddess'
(lyric at vsco)
to continue these explorations
i am not happy to report
that the delay has yet to 
find resolution...in any case,
two versions of the track 
should be available in a loosely
defined soon not to mention
v.e.clem which is also on the
back burner...meanwhile if
you are starving for skinny
girls, no relation to bare
naked ladies, material - scroll

(lyric and chords for OSPEW)

verse/chorus
wisdom hand magic touch held dream

thin as fire our death still in a scream 

sometimes remembering by candle light

bell chimes like your sandal shuffle right

left the world our burning love

ocean sand prints the eternal wave

moon pours out sunrise’s yellow grave

other times deja vu kiss we feel

hell of now these moments we steal

theft the world elevation above

lennon singing nobody told me ther’d be days like these

walrus blind lust sold nothing prayer knees

sometimes in voodoo rock and roll we are free

heaven in ruins like notre dame or me

bereft the world without true love 

theft the world elevation above

left the world our burning love

wisdom hand magic touch held dream

thin as fire our death still in a scream 

sometimes remembering by candle light

bell chimes like your sandal shuffle right

left the world our burning love

left the world our burning love

instrumental song i heard
it’s a wedding  march it was april, were we wed?

how many years how many tears

mist and tale tell neon signs i tell you the  
plot of easy rider is the same as in turn the page

 The recording, waveform 12
although "home" the track wasnt empty
my lament at the impossible first take.
goddess that is or was,
second take delivery sirena door,
i fiddled notes before third take
not as on, more ballad than intended.
four and five trying for time
arriving at six, but i don;t
sing the same without holding the axe -
the full story of that song...
well that is a novel, i might not get to write...
in any case, cover is praise 
vulcan's wife - because i owe Him a poem.
java jolted i noted
third earthquakes in new april york
i think i made friends with def and grace -

she lost pick, hella died. 
foreign correspondent, rose glascock -
no erection for films now, 
still at lucy in the sky with hale
yup pll season one, as bad as it gets -
the ppl of cali are lucky to have her...
had no idea about joshua tree until.
my point is you have an obvious star,
why make her work seven years 
on a soap operaesque triviality tease from which there
is no escape -
so anti-meritorious.
.
i like the word transnistria...
not sure about the place, pridnestrovian...
otherwise thinking about tits.
i ask myself if i really love emilee. 
why still the distraction...song i heard
today i only have eyes for tits, i mean you...


	    
 This is derailing, jokerman dance
trisapol city do you like my records?
perhaps it is distance, what am i standing here for?
ah yes dreams, but peek the broken handcuff tattoo
aurora anarchy has on her tits, 
i didnt mean to put down karli mergenthaler -
or to like melanie marie's breast...
not as on, dream pool woman with three tits.
like a strap across her chest - 
i was playing, lost my martin, asked
stood in a room where funny fat women moaned -
raising their hands until wet dream...
sweatpants i have not worn...
more concerned with my six string - 
bully men take no note - lock the door.
i wait then awake to find my acoustic still there.

alec baldwin got his patience stolen, again -

more recent scene, switzerland guitar. 
fifty frets, ten dollars -
i walk over to emilee, is this alright
she reaches red purse for money
but i explain that i am asking for her permission -
i got the bullets...
i get up feeling the fakes wanting her safety net.
i finalize the details of her portrait,
nearly done now upon my wall. 
there's talk from kinsky vienna klimt
thirty million but i cant translate
cover my two room windows with aluminum foil -
felt shot down and hobbled last walk.
.
i listen to tore down...
regret my tone is more freddie, than slwohand...
that is, when simply strumming here.
a bunch of new chord progressions. 
no new songs, i argue with her...but i love her more than tits.
i dream she writes me three notes, gives them to me...
i lay me down at the foot of the ash tree instead of reading
i am mesmerized by fluttering things of a tan disposition,
a spider web with two spiders and an army of perhaps ants
crawling away from the under bush - i think for a minute
it is from my elbow...it's all i can think about for some
time hoping she has returned to me...
meanwhile i think i made friends with eliott easton.
i get instagram but start looking for signs...
i delete the app knowing there is no way
i can digest all the content in context without
misplacing logic even if it accents loneliness.
i had not seen my satanic ritual art for odeya rush
in a while...hmm out of the blue the hint of maria
neverova but i have no idea why...i suspect the boundary
problem with some family members but why riot against
the unknown...best to fight nasal congestion instead...
play my scales,
sandwich and chips...
wait for emilee most likely in vain. 
i swear sometimes i think even keira is jealous.
surely i have said too much and i won't call you shirley again.

xiii
sunday was saying kfc and 
sunday was saying pizza
i look at leah and recall
emilee would commit a crime
for a plate of pasta...
cleaning up as little as possible
i fix the noodles and watch the show -
well i only listend to one 
episode while cleaning and
cooking then viewd the following
one ending in
lab mice cages..
.pages of skin in a bikini dream
i glide my hand under the latex 
which is surprisingly
flexible the girl has beauty
mark on her right and
as i feel down to a shaved 
wax center it occurs to me
that i was with someone else 
a minute go yet could
not recall the details...
she seems to smile but i
wake up nearly worried 
that i have not been  true
to my desire...perhaps it was staying
up late wondering over t
he daytona news about the man
at the holiday inn reportedly offd 
himself to avoid
a hit and run incident...
i suppose for the possible
meanings and obviously the fact 
that no one tells
when you rent a room
in most cases that something
like that happened...didn't go 
out but thought about
that other walk, 
the dream that day had been about
 someone upset making dogs pay for the anger...
several poor pups, 
some where slammed and others
where thrown out the window...
i myself threw a  few dollars at ocean
protocol, everytime i think 
to get golem i hear led zep 
the evil one, ramble on -
do i continue this path into season two...
i can't really decide 
- on the one hand the list
of films to watch is rising 
but it gives me something
to look ahead to and on the
other hand i had wanted
to see all the lucy hale in 
action...for titty
fans there is the horizontal dude,
but my favorite was a cinderella story
once upon a song...i wonder
if it was eiza competition...
looking at the date.
looking at the hour 
it doesn't feel alike midnight.
oklahoma had it awful last night 
i noticed while reading about cambodia...
munitions, my music oh
yeah that one was sort of cool
in a quirky way...
not the twenty dead,
but 'all i wanted'...
hopefully one day we can come 
up with something
to rival 'roll out the barrel'...
meanwhile please consider more safety 
on baltimore roads for people driving 
home after a ten hour work day...
i remember emilee and keira both spoke about
the anxiety - in their case before - i was 
more concerned later 
over the curtained econoline -
travel is necessary but truck 
stops and parking
lots aint good for much, 
in that sense my mind
was much eased given that
soon after the salon
shut down they were sort of together again - 
listening to macbeth, 
as i do once in a while,
screw your courage
to the sticking place and
we'll not fail, 
i had a vision of her aunt...
not sure what it meant
last week when i 
felt no hunger at hopelessness
- maybe the words to so you wanna
be a rock and roll star
are more than lyrics "a little insane"...
contrast cypress
"shits funny how impossible dreams
manifest"... hill,
long nights after peck
macarthur i kept seeing myself in fatigues
a reoccurring dream from which i rose not
knowing if we were conquering or had been
overwhelmed by the forces holding the hill.
	    
xiv

	    
the last pill i saw her take,
hinted at being in love
with her style.
so much so as to desire reincarnation,
before and after,
leaving my lust in . the Dust.
I suppose, what do i do with my love, 
the dream says nothing, or there is no bus
no seductive suv, two beat up pick up trucks
a motley crowd deformed and dreary
I am about to get onto, metallic bed...
imagining eternity on the wrong road
i sigh - 
lies what are they
if the mind is true
north. car ol in a char lotte.
shots fired so new i wish i knew no more.

sour reminder 'put everything you own
here on this seat' 
i really should be more bitter
yet can't help my carefee...joy
in the bliss of being me. well
when i can escape ape planet.
people posers, scape throat shouts
threatening tranquility et cetera..
 i shave, going on a bizarre diet
to shake the hovering ghost
of take a shit instead of ejaculating -
the yen slides unable to
keep track of the toilet times,
it's a long way to the top going down
the road feeling bad...ozzy confronted
by put Ja he's us in front you replies
we don't kill today...
god has a hard on for marines because we
kill everything we see...
lincoln county road or armaggedon?

xv

have i misled, you, myself,
at joy bliss -
as if i don't need want adore.
Her, it's that the torment
torture 'ould 'ave, well too much,
The worry to say. Translate it
as obsession, perhaps thralldom, 
chained to serving, her, well the idea
of her...looking at pictures
pondering, the last ones made me
uneasy, frantic...
concerned with perception, consequences.
my soul too quick to judge
my possessiveness too trigger happy
it's only in my mind, yet married
to imagination's novelty never antiquated.

in the dream aquarium. 
i am designing or redesigning cover art
i think she is saying something, 
perhaps again my wishful thinking
i went to sleep at ten...morning,
after the mourning  and the irony
of a criminal with the same name.
as someone in the family, venice
i turn over waking confronted beach
by who or what makes me play 'dirty laundry'...
it's three or so, rainy but not cool -
i assure you i'm not, loving her blind
of course there is a chance she hates me.
maybe there are two of her
one that needs me 
and one that makes my knees 
sneeze.  
bless you emilee both...
he grins at the line, all this sure-
yet what exactly can she do with all
this devotion or even love?  at least
her teacher gave her ten dollars -
once upon a time...besides if she 
was sitting here next to me would 
i still be into it. itself. maybe,
that bush is why said knowing humans
and fish can coexist in peace, did
her lifestyle imply mermaid. joy
to the world all the boys and girls,
take my advice or you'll curse the day
you started rollin' down that
lost highway...  'I want you to get 
a fuckin' driver's manual, 
and I want you to study 
that motherfucker!" 
	    
xv

s'ure there were lessons too.
i suppose i could, instruct
her on laziness - thoughts
crawl, red legged thru maze
outside of logic, yet
to make certain, these two
seemingly days i could spend more
time for her - carli i said fucking
of course i miss the point
down pull the details
who would risk. nickolodean jam master -
oh nobody looks at that sort of-
irony -yet the volusia watermark zone,
instead of knight or saint 
i dream sitcom. telling someone
i'm oldfashioned actually a pull over
top dress borderline slander

i need you to believe...in the impossible.
tailgate- you might ask what does he want
record, not much really- her salvation
in case the truth can indeed be twisted
like the word extremist, 
	    (he plays Asus2 Dmaj9 and G)
to sing what memory rings -
"isis" "who do you love" "wide open" mojo...
medley med mera, tint my tangled hair
print my declaration again for her
which is starting to sound more 
unconditional than i want it to bee
honey  steak aunt buzz yet i'm still in a worry
dream a blur perhaps her- ancient architecture
yet awaking to mind foe as if
temple. skull, no sense church.
maggots trying to joint transaction. 
i can't stand the thought of being foolish-
the laughingstock of missed reflections
wanker won't miss pretty little liars
voting not to carry on further. they
'hould 'ave stopped too and let lucy shine.
lucifer lighters torch up religious smokes.
nothing is true everything is permitted -
shaving why do the blades suddenly all right.
the defintion of ride or die appears at arm.
no exit escape, what shape is this poetry
if it is not also prose. no exit escape, 
who is this man that needs her from head
to her toes...

xvi
he wants to edit that line -
who is this man in such need of her
from her head top down to her toes...
octopus ceviche finds him wondering -
siderewicz, barbara osf. 
overwhelming sensation,
he listens as if ears stumbled
he lies as if it has been three 
days of love me emilee
time is not indeed, time is the evil
beloved the hours ours -
in fact three years like nothing
before - jewish girl saying
palestine does not exist vanished -
marriage is between a man and a whoa
it's hip now to anti semi truck
but that road has always been in style-
curb my polo ticks,

ask the rabbi if i can brand myself

it is crowded at the airport
make way for the president of the republic
they say but contra israel protest confronts
the crossing from the front-
feels like dreaming in a sardine can,
take me to sardi's -

kenya stop, why does magua hate the gray
hair so much, keira dawn it's not only "teeth"
the whole record is divine -
die monster die, re - 
nearly stepping on australian soil
i feel genocidal, yes only raspberryemi !!

this ain't rock n roll -
magua understands the white man is a dog
to his women...penny dreadful wes,
studying my role -
katie bar the door - bark delivery hark -
yes i feel like the last of the mohicans,
what are we eating emily, the blood
of our enemies. Magua will eat his heart...
Children under the knife...Seed wiped
out forever...
of course in a casual manner, protocol
you see...still, to give myself away
at unrequited love makes Dante nudge Virgil
'at least i actually looked at Beatrice once
upon a time' well i do declare, i never.
any nairobian even thinking about nine year
old charlie horse won't make it - or i'll come back
and kill every one of you sons of bitches.

xvii

it is, more accurate. unrequested love. 
what the hell might one reply -
rickles never really told a joke. 
In fact, mostly truths. i want to 
stick it to D & V, but my thoughts
are crowded with song lyrics,
not my own and lines from scipts
embedded like stars in the sky mind
but lookit, no i have not beheld
the object bitch of my adoration
yet you never got to see beatrice
post on social media, so it evens 
out. 
in.
the white album revolution -
i can't help it - 
how you feel is how you feel -
number nine, what am i asking -
not much- nothing in fact
nothing to prove -
i animate counterrevolutionaries

begging i suppose you'd call it -
never let me goooooo...
nothing else doing nothing done
eyeliner, i'm shocked
worry all night
at her annoying altar. Still,
illogical yet
it must throw the opposition into chaos.

omfg he really means it
even as dreams flicker, i feel the
envy - you got something better,
you got a heart of stone... 
dream knife door invasion 
Rolled out wallet -
voodoo mojo on the floor
someome is looking at my Zara...
like food - 
haunted later as if still, 
serving a warrant search -
here in my headquarters
self reserved for her or
myself knowing the never us
like a dream playing basket
nike air one - broke
then the woman with circle heel.
wood, center nailed handing them to 
now confirmed, my confusion. 
how to high heel sneaker?
thoughts of her no doubt-
wake up to find you are the eyes,
of the girl, world spins 
notice i did not wish her here.
The, invitation was not to force,
indeed an option of freedom, well of
freedom chained to love's rioting addiction.

(post-script, as i ate my turkey sandwich,

not having met john huston or mae west,

witchcraft to get a grant,
one of my mothers, who died
of loop us, gave me that mojo
i dreamt as being floored...
obviously, given that her and

it could be that i am under a spell -
or as mackenzie put placed it
can somebody tell this bitch

in any case, i don't think that is

So I'm walking down the street

Ain't got two call
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home
Don't ease me in

You know that the dress she wears, sweet lord
It's pink and blue she brings me coffee
You know she brings me tea
She brings about every damn thing

(exile's letter,
-from pound's translation of li bai-
two skinny girls)
	    
Sokin of Rakuho, oh ancient friend, I now remember

you built me a special tavern,

By the south side of the bridge .

With yellow gold and white jewels

we paid for songs and laughter,

And we were stoned for month on month,

forgetting the kings and princes.

Intelligent men came drifting in, from the sea

and from the west border,

And with them, and with you especially,

there was nothing at cross-purpose;

And they made nothing of sea-crossing

or of mountain-crossing,

and only they could be of that fellowship.

And we all spoke out our hearts and minds …

and without regret.

And then I was sent off to South Wei,

smothered in laurel groves,

And you to the north of Raku-hoku,

Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common.

tween us. And when separation had come to its worst

We met, and travelled together into Sen-Go

Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting waters;

Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers …

that was the first valley,

then into ten thousand valleys

full of voices and pine-winds.

and With silver harness and reins of gold,


Out came the East-of-Kan boatswain and his company;

And there came also the “True-man” of Shi-yo to meet me,

Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.

In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us

more Sennin music;

Many instruments, like the sound of young phœnix broods.

And the boatswain of Kan-Chu, intoxicated,

danced because his long sleeves

Wouldn’t keep still, with that music playing.

And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap,

And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens.

And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars or rain.

	    scattered like stars or rain...

I had to be off , far away over the waters,

You back to your river-bridge.

And your elder, who was brave as a leopard,

Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble.

And one May he had you send for me, despite the long distance;

And what with broken wheels and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t going hard …

Over roads twisted like sheep’s guts.

And I was still going, late in the year,

in the cutting wind from the north,

And thinking how little you cared for the cost …

and you caring enough to pay it.

and what a reception!

Red jade cups, food well set, on a blue jewelled table;

 I was stoned, and had no thought of returning;

And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,

To the dynastic temple, with the water about it clear as blue jade,

With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,

With ripples like dragon-scales going green grassy on the water,

Pleasure lasting, with courtezans going and coming without hindrance,

and the willow-flakes falling like snow,

And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,

And the water a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows—

Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,

Gracefully painted—and the girls singing back at each other,

Dancing in transparent brocade,

And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,

Tossing it up under the clouds.

And all this comes to an end,

And is not again to be met with.

I went up to the court for examination,

Tried Layu’s luck, offered the khoyu song,

 got no promotion,

And went back to the East Mountains white-headed.

And once again we met, later, at the South Bridge head.

yes the crowd broke up—you went north to San palace.

And if you ask how I regret that parting?

It is like the flowers falling inspring’s end,

confused, whirled in a tangle.

What is the use of talking! And there is no end of talking—

There is no end of things in the heart.

I call in the boy,

Have him sit on his knees here to  seal this,

And  send it a thousand miles, thinking.

 The day sun, sun day
although "here" no dream
felt her drift away.
All white, cloud rain,
 skeleton drops in,
my first nickname
so you know, her love atop
pheobe tonkin, sapphic
Jump scare, to see her erotic,
I find a thousand knives
cassetted in chest rewinding...
playback of my desire, idk, wtf...
map of china slides off the wall
I continued in the mayhem
as if insane. settle down
into captions - why does it hurt
so despite the no chance -

knowledge, i do the dishes. 
mop dead sons, from why lament -
floor nocturne dawn, 
fuck them kids
modesty blaise no maybe
perhaps bell book and candle,
can't believe how good the steak...
takes the salt.
To say then in the remnants,
of madness yes but you don't
do much if you are thinking of her.
modus opera and i yeah but
that means i'm satisfied.
der holle rache
i ain't no holler back girl -
this shit is bananas
same meal five times he says.
no more, i roar...
cornered by nietzsche...
beyond good and evil
Not that you lied to me
	but that I no longer
believe you -
that is what has distressed me.
devil deal well she's the boss
girlboss, god zeal
i get up a little while ago
neverova in my thoughts putin.
mention  suze
as muse 
all those years ago;
goddess. hence soviet stamp
on handwroted lyric but
i'm terrible at balancing
paris blues
like sofia but catalan safe
for now, emilee please
let me obituary party...
no. sorry corman. 
no glot clom fly day...
of course the first second
i feel thinking of her
not much else does math,
love makes all else trivial.
soulless leftovers await.
no i am not trying to 
make sense, dear readers,
it's only a mind breathing
here an inhale there an exhale.
bound to fail, but a few
lines can't ever be tanned
by either sun as they 
remain pale...nearly untamed
at see through in the timeless
whenever there is ever.

	    lyric 1871 two skinny girls
from oliver's translation mostly)
	    
As I was floating down unconcerned Rivers
I no longer felt myself steered by the haulers:
Gaudy Redskins had taken them all for targets
Nailing them naked to coloured stakes.

I cared nothing for all my crews,
Carrying Flemish wheat or English cottons.
along with my haulers those uproars were done with
The Rivers let me sail downstream where I pleased.

Into the ferocious tide-rips
Last winter, more absorbed than the minds of children,
I ran! And the unmoored Peninsulas
Never endured more triumphant clamourings

The storm made bliss of my sea-borne awakenings.
Lighter than a cork, I danced on the waves
Which men call eternal rollers of victims,
For ten nights, without once missing the foolish eye of the harbor lights!

Sweeter than the flesh of sour apples to children,
The green waters penetrated my pinewood hull
washed me clean of the bluish wine-stains and the splashes of vomit,
Carrying away both rudder and anchor.

And from that time on I bathed in the Poem
Of the Sea, star-infused and churned into milk,
Devouring the green azures; where, entranced in pallid flotsam,
A dreaming drowned man sometimes goes down;

Where, suddenly dyeing the bluenesses, deliriums
the slow rhythms under the gleams of the daylight,
Stronger than alcohol, vaster than music
Ferment the bitter rednesses of love!

I have come to know the skies splitting with lightnings, and the waterspouts
And the breakers and the currents; I know the evening,
And Dawn rising up like a flock of doves,
And sometimes sometimes I have seen what men have imagined they saw!

I have seen the low-hanging sun speckled with mystic horrors.
Lighting up long violet coagulations,
Like the performers in very-antique dramas
Waves rolling back into the distances their shiverings of venetian blinds!

I have dreamed of the green night of the dazzled snows
The kiss rising slowly to the eyes of the seas,
The circulation of undreamed-of saps,
And the yellow-blue awakenings of singing phosphorus!

I have followed, for whole months on end, the swells
Battering the reefs like hysterical herds of cows,
Never dreaming that the luminous feet of the Marys
Could force back the muzzles of snorting Oceans!

I have struck, do you realize, incredible Floridas
Where mingle with flowers the eyes of panthers
In human skins! Rainbows stretched like bridles
Under the seas' horizon, to glaucous herds!

I have seen the enormous swamps seething, traps
Where a whole leviathan rots in the reeds!
Downfalls of waters in the midst of the calm
And distances cataracting down into abysses!

Glaciers, suns of silver, waves of pearl, skies of red-hot coals!
Hideous wrecks at the bottom of brown gulfs
Where the giant snakes devoured by vermin
Fell from the twisted trees with black odours!

I should have liked to show to children those dolphins
Of  blue wave, those golden, those singing fishes.
- Foam of flowers rocked my driftings
And at times ineffable winds would lend me wings.

Sometimes, a martyr weary of poles and zones,
The sea whose sobs sweetened my rollings
Lifted its shadow-flowers with their yellow sucking disks toward me
And I hung there like a kneeling woman...

Almost an island, tossing on my beaches the brawls
And droppings of pale-eyed, clamouring bird,
And I was scudding along when across my frayed cordage
Drowned men sank backwards into sleep!

But now now I, a boat lost under the hair of coves,
Hurled by the hurricane into the birdless ether,
I, whose wreck, dead-drunk and sodden with water,
neither Monitor nor Hanse ships would have fished up;

Free, smoking, risen from violet fogs,
I who bored through the wall of the reddening sky
Which bears a sweetmeat good poets find delicious,
Lichens of sunlight mixed with azure snot,

Who ran, speckled with lunula of electricity,
A crazy plank, with black sea-horses for escort,
When Julys would crush with cudgel blows
Skies of ultramarine into burning funnels;

I who trembled, to feel at fifty leagues' distance
The groans of Behemoth's rutting, and of the dense Maelstroms
Eternal spinner of blue immobilities
I long for Europe with it's aged old parapets!

I have seen archipelagos of stars! and islands
Whose delirious skies are open to sailors: 
- Do you sleep, are you exiled in those bottomless nights,
Million golden birds, O Life Force of the future? -

But, truly, I have wept too much! The Dawns are heartbreaking.
Every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter:
Sharp love has swollen me up with heady langours.
O let my keel split! O let me sink to the bottom!

If there is one water in Europe I want, it is the
Dark cold pool where into the scented twilight
A child squatting full of sadness, launches
A boat as fragile as a butterfly in May.

I can no more, bathe in your langours, O waves,
Sail in the wake of the carriers of cottons,
Nor undergo the pride of the flags and pennants,
Nor pull past the horrible eyes of the hulks.

ever is there when
ever timeless 
the in through see:
i feel so in love
so poetic yet i need
to i feel more prose
as certain things arose -
perhaps it is
her mentioning
crisis at midnight
a few days ago...or
that erotic vision...
my own business, mob
it is not mine or anyone's
affair - i simply debrief
myself as a writer writing...
i solely get emotional as
what they call now a pronoun
in lust-love 
yes, i hear judgements
and even hostility as if
i were a saint that 
could summon her 
or a slut stud
that could command her
neither nor either
her being 
at twentytwo 
older than my
recent adorations i
cannot expect to be
surprised by bullies
echoing guns and roses
as if unlocking the door
to some email laundry party...
no i don't know how to protect
her entirely and i get blinded
by jealousy irrational jealousy
in a manner of speaking...
obviously i ain't going
to plastic surgery tonkin myself
into pheobe...i went to sleep
in the late afternoon thinking
forever...got up at midnight.
dream of her in a vague
distance...it felt like
the bath, 
	imagining
there we are
but suddenly famine family
how can i ever explain
that i sense doing kitchen
work is murdering my unborn
offspring - when she started
at the salon she said she needed
the spring later i found 
a coiled metal in mattress
i am not sure how it should
arrive in thoughts so now
so me, we live in a post-modern
hookup friends with beans fit drug
divorce knife firearm destruction
so allow me to deconstruct it thus
i want her fidelity but it is mine
me saying yes to her is not her
agreement - the deal is 
just like that...although how
high i feel when it files mutual.
ohio calls but i wonder why omaha
mali-gnant burundi rimbaud in
the slavery business, i left in
the car horn
about 
	'Whose delirious skies are open to sailors...'
bc it was all in one take
& the stanza concludes with
	    'life force of the future'
then i felt as if arthur had
himself intended it like that -
i first translated that poem
for mother a long scotch tape scroll
given years ago...
that is to say we were acquainted...
i sat beauty portrait on my knee
and found her bitter...
i suppose some will gaze at
"we will fry your balls in olive oil"
and think it is melting as they near...
or maybe it was only knowing that
i was headed into this liner note
which again nearly missed telling
that usually it was li po in terms 
of exile's letter as it was peking
peek now li bai ahem beijing...
looking at it now i see her 
in the snow with a side smile
and twirl and only desire 
to make more explorations into
portraits of her...
apologies to all i have not
given proper attention to
in my obsession, i am under
a spell as you can tell
by how the words spill
	ever is there when
ever timeless 
the in through sea waves
and stories not salvation
still
drool saliva
ever is there when
ever timeless 
the in through see.

if you arrived after the fact
to scroll down for a song,
mentioned please note 
we only keep one for a while
currently, im thru with love.

here are the lyrics for
	    
"fix vein's due" and "lemures"

	    fix vein's due
	    
	she keep sayin i love you
but it ain't to me
i'm tore down lonesome it's true
got cigarette ashes in my tea

she keep sayin i love you
but it ain't to me
dead horse no trace of glue
stuck on her like a praying man on bended knee

she keep sayin i love you
but it ain't to me
it's a long road and my fix vein's due
luck on my side but it had to pee

i̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶r̶y̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶s̶a̶d̶d̶l̶e̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶a̶ ̶t̶o̶w̶n̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶b̶l̶u̶e̶ ̶

w̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶m̶e̶n̶ ̶a̶i̶n̶t̶ ̶n̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶ ̶f̶r̶e̶e̶ ̶

she keep sayin i love you
but it ain't to me
she's cryin over slavery 
crying over the government flu
oh them tears and the dead kennedys 
don't mean a thing to me

she keep sayin i love you 
wouldn't you know it ain't to me

she keep sayin i love you i love you
ugh but it ain't to me

she keep sayin i love you i love you
oh it ain't to me

she keep sayin i love you i love you i love you so
but it ain't to me...

	    LEMURES
lamia, oh lamia, It’s for your sake alone,
I’ve thirsted for blood, yeah i'm cold like a stone.
I’ve lived a thousand years, To weep and to mourn,
I am a vampire's child, where demon virgins moan .

hera took her offspring, their sunken eyes enslaved in clouds,
That made lamia a blizzard, That took me from the crowds:
i still feel the snow, cold white as a dog licked bone,
I am a vampire's child, where the angels have no throne.

I’ve built this floating castle , beyond jurisdiction,
Where I can see my lover, like a dream like an addiction:
Where I can hear the poets, recite from their gravestone,
I am a vampire's child, wed to bloodlust alone...

	   xxxi
five fifteen, always think of that who
song out of my mind -
	"The ushers are sniffing
Eau-de-coloning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting"

but it's the date not the hour or train.
try a little tenderness redding munro...
wake to that echo having
wedding picture dream
girl getting rib tattoo
then girl topless giving head

how did he get the hat back
in bell book and candle
after breaking off the marriage...

the contradiction
at not liking porn
yet feeling an obligation
to know as it trends
gives me a sort of 
migraine of the soul...

i talk to senile mother
going off on a rant against
psycho logy, i suppose
i'm right but maybe
too explosive -

three in the morning now
sorrow mixed with confusion
even skirt is quiet...

guys look at the earrings i just made-
	    
cat likes to speak when
i slide out my sleep room -

the cannes fires up its engines...

but i'm hoping for the next polanski film.

emilee re-styled nails in blue and white

ribbons i thought were lace -

race through hours in some weird worry...

possibly knowing the impossibilty

of holding her hand, now when i need

it most. tilly i mean that figuratively.

	    man 

woman or teen
	    
	    how i 

hate that beatles song now...

as i type i feel the intrusion

either locals or so called next of kin

or most likely locals pretending it is kinning

oh rly...no i have not invited cleveland

	    'Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio'...

loaded lock, undone
by poem near done -
	to shut index
browser - he rewrites
nothing as good as first take
yet he has some of it in
iron butterfly

how sad. his sadness
in the movie...
witches and warlocks won't weep-
how can she mean so much
to his him
the latest informant claims

it stems from sixteen oh five
the same meal five x a day
maybe why he heard it in dream...

he only eats once a day
perhaps a snack
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
they say predestined ordained
sixty six
founding year of church of...
sat-
an
	    
twin flame soul mates
what a mess
meanwhile
is it leave me alone
to keep a stay
	    
not even she is able
to lower his rebel flag

James Innes Randolph Jr.
no tri
umph

leads to hours long no song
extended scrabble game
an a gram sniff nostril
guess air
	    
twirl hair-yes even fair is
foul has its places
	    
aces he should be
celebrating one of his
	new hit songs
instead of living in dark eyes -
	How I love you, how I fear you,
It seems I met you in an unlucky hour!
	no not 1874
the empire burlesque
	    I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes
	    
he sleeps he naps he snaps at visions
...he finds faith yet tells her
the kerouac mind is too vast 
now translated as tv mind
	like a commercial interruption
reserved for emilee
still he appreciates the hallucination

	thinking however
	what if the spirit world
	is like freshman universe
	fake idea at fashion bar

he can feel her there with him

but the motley crew cuts in like static -

makes him smoke more than he indent intend
in the end yeah he simply can't 

figure if this extemporanous second
draft is near enough to 

going across the ocean with grandfather edwin
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

we mow down one of the lesser prime ministers
with rap rounds
	    fee echo wrap


nothing but proverbial net

spa soap face

rylee extremely sexy for a wednesday.
alexandra locked out climbs spandex into window.
but he's thinking why would

a grown woman tell 
	    
	   an "ethnic"

gru op to kick the fucking door dow...n.

harpers reports americans were more content 
	in 2020
he wonders if any of his fell owl merickins
realize how many repeat episodes of 
the sitcom presidency they have been
put placed through true story so sorry

his mind a jigsaw puddle puzzle
near tears anytime there is a tear
in the logic of her yet 
his thoughts jet plunder peace
at her imagined presence

precisely then he thought; also -
as if he didn't have enough aint it thoughts
paint it painted lit
- that railroad dream right there with her
as she disappeared was only saying
from the scot lariat
	bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set-
the only word he frowns upon now is bet,
used to be bovine...
	    in a moo calf sense
leather wip how was that for us
ah to be safely thus...
	    excuse him he's an 
excitable boy they can always half
argue over the werewolf and the pants
	over the moon
	is it too soon
	does he ultimatum 
	only to cower at her tower
	tips are welcome
	i come grimalkin
not to mention the unmentionable
emotion of losing an aunt and mother
as if a coordinated double tap
irony spat upon face it
slowly
Nobody wants to do the crazy things we used to do before
	this took an hour 
	wilted is the flower
        oh how i wanted it to be 
	    those original petals...
manuscripts don't burn
he won't real true grit know until
reading it back at some other our...
what the hell it's the lyric to bat
	outta hell -
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late
which he always heard or sang along to 
instead 
	    side arm curve
arm side is her name indeed can't stop
a stupid man in a suit of smoke.
he recalls his own line, floor of ashes
but he is not certain how to steal from himself -
at the very let there be light here
it was 'a person in love is stealing,
what else keeps the image' from one of 
his later poems - lay teaser pose
a promise is a promise
we believe his sorrow aside from the obvious
is rooted in the fact that his deal is far from
fair. fair from far, far away and over the hills
thrills that await further thrills still.


	    post-script
spasibo bulgakov, what actually 
went down was yet in the secondary
set of pages yeah here is how
it was meant to go:))
	    
	gee or jee, he was awful
sad out of my mind -
in the film
witches and warlocks
don't weep
he sleeps he eats he naps

he wonders how.
does she rly mean so much...
the last informant
claims it was preordained
a twin flame soul mate


he thinks 
(I have thee not, and yet I see thee still)
sixteen oh five maybe that	    
	    is why he heard
the dream say same meal five times a day...

sixty six he eats once perhaps a snack
founding date of the church
of sat-
an

he's lost in an extended scrabble 
an a gram of sniff nostril
guess air heart of glass...

did he eat of the insane root
going off on leave me alone then
don't leave me alone-
tri umph, but she must know
not even she is able to 
lower his rebel flag-


James Innes Randolph Jr
he is right about not 

knowing if spiritually-
	    
fake ids are a thing
like freshman universe pub-

dang kerouac's vast mind...

turned into tv mind.

tea vision faith

i caint cheat he says to her -

reserved for emilee...

revising the expanding jigsaw
puddle puzzle

splish splash he was 

supposed to be celebrating

	    one
of his hit songs...

instead dark eyes
	    
	    How I love you, how I fear you,
It seems I met you in an unlucky hour!

no not 1874 the empire burlesque

But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized

All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes...

he listens again with grandfather edwin

Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

i see now the railroad dream was not maybe
my insecurity a scot lariat 
 bring the rope...

(it was thursday which
felt like a sunday

in contrast
a dozen soviet leaders
in the same time frame...

i dunno why i went
third person into pluralities

so to subtract the vices
there has been more
diversity in moscow
than new york) or washington...

that is where i remember
emilee in the snow -

love that vibe face grin
listening to pupil in
oak chair pose

i can't escape it

even viewing late night with the devil

(film gets a few things very correctly right)

i try to save her by playing my ten scales

later greeted by her in the silky azure top

she looks thin and not carefree

i say to myself it's the blouse from

you have nothing to be ashamed of 

yet it is also the costume from these are 

my sisters crumblin'

reading the words back, i'm overwhelmed

by how clearly meatloaf rises in ear memory

possibly for once upon a time

i don't want no pickle i just wannna ride

on my motorcycle looking at sky instead of road

crashed into a ditch...

i figured, since it is dressy, she is going out.

i shave, slip into sleep -

a strange sensation that her aunt betrayed her...

i dream in another language woman with boy

there implying to the kid be nice to her...

obvious invasion of body snatcher

day before also a scene in that speaking

pretty woman something about shopping -

baffled, puzzlin' evidence...mystery achievement -

i turn in bed i return to bleeding soul in scene

fulfilled it is her, well pictures of her

yet luminous, lovely just like i imagine...

for a minute i am extremely satisfied.

ride dream into subway train, estimating

the walk from wall street to times square

circle no question, no direction home -

ludivine then in her house, i guess she

heard me thinking of swimming pool 

paranoia is keira trying to kill me 

outta envy -

even the wristwatches seem vague

gerard is packing gifts, i don't know

don't have as good a french memory as hollywood

but yeah in that two part masterpiece

they were sort of co-stars -

zodiac devilish emilee recall...

post with gothic chanting, enchanting -

anyway i awake to wear the worry

that perhaps all this thinking of

her is too much, 

yet in the untangible me

i know it is only the way i am

maybe even the way she wants me.

if she would. 

 xxxiv
(eight saturday teen
felt like a frying says

table sayeth dream
a technicolor cinemath
i couldn't count...

division mind breathing
the cut down birnam forest

so to dunsinane thinking
not stopping
till they all smash
heart shaped eye emo gee) 

is it a quiz
life questions don't quit-

when life gives you lemons
the file of thelma
no reel asian to thelema

to thine own do what thy will

till furniture porn field

(six tee yards d/same bird)

i haitian python-anywhere

pray to saint anne

heche 

jet lag, the dead travel fast

no even faster than that 

i'm in volusia, i'm in manhattan

i'm in cannes half blind from 

the bills of flash photography

i'm here and in moscow

not to mention london

it is not heresy and i will not recant

can't confirm rejuvenatin' pope

with the flesh of pervert priests

chopped up in rome basement so

six stops lesson you count seven

dorothy ozzy kansas

gall bladderless sibling

pictures me with the president

of the south american nick cage

fan club - dearly departing aunt

to be precise but it irks me

lika tattoo in reverse

leica it werent a gift feeling

but a graft thieving

i even confuse emilee with emily

stones undercover of the night

we got nothing to prove

it's pretty lib ear aint it

liberating, funny i feel

no freedom, hounded -

can't have me no woman 

don't want me no man

i'm happy emilee had a nice brekkie

leads one to askkk

why keep me from my own her mind

imagine imagination barbwire girl

in a barbwire world

driver and car all up in flames

suddenly some other alice

emails i axe plain i'm taken

dylan asked if you can read 

my mind why must i speak

silence is what ate tits

i only have eyes for tits,

i mean you.

yeah i could or should

quotation mark or punctuate

yet i fear drowning in form

as i swim - nevertheless

spam quote "keira sent

you a booty call"

peach emoji tween y and c

whine and sea

the argument goes i got you those gloves

reminds me of dead ringers, hi rachel
	    
smh, i question if i am coming off

as trivial - 

my stance is serious 

cyrus the climb at this point

in the journey i suppose something

is detached the house itself

not being shakespeare or at the globe

i don't much enjoy repeating 

but i sense i have to sneeze it again

bless you all but in the present

i'm only pondering emilee grant

goodness gracious great balls of fire penis

i hate all men

'So there I was sitting in front of Jed's
store over in Cunt Lick
my peter standing up 
straight as a jack pine
under my Levis 
just a-pulsin' in the sun ...'

restore myself to barbie as princess and pauper

i won't admit listening to

man woman or teen i can feel that heat closing in

put the groceries away

rice onions 

skirt overdosing on the chicken

barbara stanwyck fading out

streisand i didn't mention

but now that dream wherein i saw her

egh not bs standing by the fridge

dirt on one of her shoulders

a stranger reaching a touch

me picking up chair to strike him away

awaking to a baffled morning

i didn't wroted since the idea seemed

local not locatable

yet now it seems to be locked in with

what i have felt as repercussions

"Seems," madam? Nay, it is; I know not "seems."

is the rest silence? bra speaks tits

there's a nipple to this curve

but you will nibble it out of

context everywhich way but cut

from the fact the innocent

fact that i love all her faces,

and this traces that oath -

races away from both

night and day, into beyond.

ya ever burn a nigger?

and strolling minstrels play

but i'd rather be in my library

reading science books all day

lilly lets out mr wiggles

as if to harmonize

mr wiggens is obituarized

yes, emilee, i nearly did party

but i promise it wasn't no ball

darn imaginary promises

poses the memory mid sentence

like boo hoo rating the act

mostly in mids i believe

the only time filmed walking

out to lunch from lucky cat

gas station guy if you recall

i suspect that hubris led to 

missing bath and bail

baph O! met i hope 

the state of flow rid

expunges before my

cosmas and damian coughs

didn't you know it

she's with stupid

lamb's lahar here ink

on his arm

'the crazy will of margaret
	thatcher that they've all got'

french drawing soraya
stuck on new testament
book of revelations
tune turning it into collage
was it lara 
(in case i missed any mayhem;
you don't want to sell me death sticks
you want to go home and rethink your life)
what the fuck is star wars about
in a motorola galaxy far away
he switches index page
to 2024
quickly opting to exterminate
with extreme prejudice
to exterminate all rational thought -
dear floridian
who once upon atime vibed
heavily in the snow,
should've said it
like yesr ago

i am yours - even if pregnant 
with fat belly and fuller thighs.

dear vulkan


it is the twentieth of may - as i sit here, head melting,
after sex melting, surrounded by smoke 
and thoughts of my beloved emilee

at the end of the book - ah yes hail before you look,
through the clock's delay at my promised song
know that i gave your wife two covers

and while hopefully painting mine, caravaggio
said it was whispered to him even before 
macbeth of real witch bard

so perhaps mutual, look at the boy bit by lizard -
then two baby reptilians on my floor slide
lavatory as if replacing Kleenex ants

therefore not elvis but you are the fountain
source father in a sense constant
avalanche further

savage in ibu indonesian crimson
purple photograph insane press
rivals gerhardt richter

center for volcanology and geological
hazard mitigation handout words
nobody uses


yet enough prelude let me poem
magical deity underworld
plumed red;

	    

the skies'
little clouds 
are made 

mere bridges upon your
landslide 
said
	    
molten with
ash ash ash so nothing
flies, nothing lies

fire ropes spew as if lords
themselves /i here humble
mumble to have 
	    
your minute
a few 
seconds 
	
more in destruction praise

a mayakovsky cat
purring no copy at your altar
unfurled every any place soared 
	
where my promised verses myth
beatnik fee line howl 
port of saints

forgiveness i beg distracted by her
lava tail

and "abigail" stealing my 
stack of rotting corpses

scream gang hammered scam
patterns sterling i watch them force
a man to retire

yet as your child planted like a mountain
upon eras beyond epoch
i do not rumble

dollars of death will come when they will
and then if you are native we shall kill!
yet remaining pure

a hundred years from now
or a thousand
to glance back 
	    
at the prodco dinosaur
that dared bring it on 
four a mere million
arriflex

illion the hex till none flex

there then now 
as for the welded girl
this fire implores
	    
you to make her trillion
see we were wroted before 

genesis
and after revelations
	    
in the book here
i say it is her, since infancy 
yet i learn it (as also myself 
in spirt womb'ed)

debris umbilical chords 
i couldn't music
for my days and nights 
were dedicated
to love's addiction

into the mystic into rivers into seas
where they even try to drown your 
highness with vlc players

ha! the UN itself a power walk
to stop your talk
bustle hawk

oh! i did say few seconds only 
a  minute...
	    
brevity soul wit
	    
bewitched by virgin foam of living
wagering on death

sometimes i feel the world
is blind to me
	    
but i am only bound 
to you and love
	    
so take my leaving word

and hail once more...
as i learned
from wagner 
	    
himself-healing only a drum's beat-light 
raised pretty high into every any place 
sword where valkyrie eternal.

dream note 20 october;a drawer full of money, didn't count it...rush into a stranger;s house; hurrying out into unknown sidewalk... 
	21, dreams blurred, updated artbreeder, redesigned wordstar.cyclic.app ...26, dream of dancing dwarves, i thought they were singing -
	the day brought disturbing news; a new nose limit, looks like your nose is running...redecorated inkrealm.info intro - lawrence welk 1978 
	face lift skit - six masterchef tumblers brought to mind you only live twice - tiger and ai the manuscript at 14,351 words - 
	i don't believe britney wroted that book, dear ramona, i have opted to replace you as my astrologer, as a girl in new zealand has won the contract 
	- oh lorde -27th iran rough draft done yay -thought about lara but dreamt of clara extra sleep felt so good - 
	dream maria sent me a purse with haul within, tan designer frames - friends, briana brancato edited out of reports but why  - 
	explosion in a cafeteriaesque place i collect my backpack items on the other side and awake -
	in the middle of slutty halloween costumes and heather in the hp lovecraft remake my erection smiled...
	www.inkrealm.info/about, planned and deployed, i think i slept well, but in my dream a brown cat was visiting skirt 
	and tried to steal five compact discs, terribly upsetting fight followed but at least it weren't a human cat fight...
	the irony of all these parties while the dance of wars waltzes, in a dream under glass like iggy pop song lyric 
	peter o'toole saunters by straightfaced alone passenger, portrait of mrs  kessler @ itsnotalive, yes this is nonlinear
	but that was the only time i really voted...day of the dead, scary monsters and super creeps in dreams i guess it awoke my thoughts before i got up, 
	screenplay in mind.

			3 november, speaking with an aunt i never speak to, how do you sleep, deletion demo, i don't want to lose you, 
	you say yes and i say no, butcher's crossing, notice the reports advanced Ai long before our hands had, back in the dream i don't want to agree 
	to a divorce because the wife's family name serves me well for society and banking and such, i get up afraid of my fictional greed, 
	dear icloud; why take up laptop space at all? n4, nearly good transition scenes at iran photoplay, still never can get used to going 
	against myself, the movie can only hint at the story, glimpses, unlike an actual story - wish i could have told f scott fitzgerald it 
	is almost exactly not writing - i get up too early for my own good, thinking of chloe and how wonderful it is to have people like that in the world
	...saturday spilled water broken haus cup, didn;t write instead "home" paged inkrealm.info, dream call but i haven't met elly, 
	martin rest ibanez at work...alarmed mother made me dress for dream guest, i ask about another aunt, he says horrible,
	i notice he is short and fat, maybe it was quarantine, or rem imposter, didnt feel like anything after that, did write a scene - 
	forced inspiration only leads to editing - later dreams a fashion show girls sitting and walking runway in fredrick's of hollywood blue 
	alike emilee's blouse - i suppose i miss her i suppose i always will - one of them like astbury when i had yet to figure out the similarity
	to aleksandra - movie with allard memories with leonor - i walk out with a rolling stone knight not even surprised we cant get no satisfaction
	- or is it keira siddenly apron never filt so attractive - the broken jacuzzi lined with crawling ants, i had nearly wept over jean harlow in 
	saratoga - everything is too expensive and i am reading ballard's cocaine nights, halfway through.n8, copyright the dementia fashion line 
	with a sub brand called senility, tagline outfit repetition is the new black, dream technicolor screen within a dior advent box a woman is showing
	me two variations, crowded room not the series some man sits atop a stack of my writing i feel upset then fury as he fondles the pages -
	i pull him out and away kicking out the boy that seemed to be with him - i load up on chicken rice and onions watching foe but
	i don't like it paul still feels like a tv actor not a character actor wasnt normal pee pole a few days ago and now ready for lifetime achievement
	awards - the gladiator governent should have been played by elton john, they could ve used his songs, crocodile rocket and such,
	say or see tits out in a badly edited film, i only held on till the bitter end for her sake, no regrets pay the ticket take the ride,
	in ladybird we trust.<br>

			n10, inertia no dream yet it might be that oppenheimer was overwhelming or the ralph lauren wood hanger resolution was kicking 
	in - kept hoping that it was daniel playing the lead but murphy's law i guess - mrs parker no relation to spiderman doubles 5,
	me dishes to dish out steak with killer wherin i saw more of the country than i have since obligatory vaccine, dude my dog story on the screen, 
	what exactly does burroughs have to be proud of...heavy metal, maybe i met someone in secret before i  said it, a secret kept even from myself?
	xmas credit seven cents back to staking, plus tvc 15 in the plan to update, boxes in a before dream coming thru the disconnected tele, a lovely
	thing that vanished as i reached for the second after knocking on the guest room door to find a naked woman's torso tits out as the beloved lesbian
	said, bronzed but bushy asian type bush, distrust followed since the disdain of masked days...talk of fumigation i am concerned for the kitten,
	skirt, exterminator instead of cleaning feels ironic - iran script over the time frame i want it to be seventy odd minutes - took all the vitamins,
	played all the scales. n11 hearing from the self proclaimed cyborg girl was the day's highlight, daria bought enough zara to open her own store, 
	i pondered and procrastinated secure in no hurry after dreaming i was with two very tall men, sort of like actors i admire, the face off leads to
	be precise, cozy with the cat contrary to the dark girl soundtrack, refried steak meal, finishing cocaine nights, itchy at five afternoon no relation
	to koo park, eleven in the moring new zealand already the next day.dear iceland i will release roadhouse blues for you then

		.n13,
	cocaine nights which i thought goodly turned into anticlimax wrap stitching the foreshadowed scenes together - by contrast rumble in the dark felt
	awful but had me in tears at the end -oh momma dream of the city sauntering as if under surveillance then a candle lit room looking at a dylan song
	awoke at two thinking it was six - stuck inside of mobile with the dirty laundry again -kick 'em when up or down, verbs call dictionary
	to add chatgpt'd - marlene told me to cover king horse, bleedthrough tracking, exported wav as mp3 didnt waveform, skip sound reaper,
	nearly good, usb went blind, later feeling axe too loud went back to find no windows, reset and reinstall everything,  
	talent is not enough for these situations, patience - remixed second version, perhaps vocals too low - now i see why the bible tells us not to speak
	to spirits - in dreams a girl has writing scribbled on her back she turns topless raising her arms brick red armpits - i'm reading super cannes - 
	i awake up minutes after dozing off - cigarettes coffee murder an obvioulsy dazed cockroach that has wandered through the hall perhaps chased
	by skirt with labs suspicion over the laptop weirdness -i'm hungry but i think it away only find dream hog-like men as i get lost in a spanish 
	town reverie- they are barefeet hoofesque - i can hear one of them say hey remember him - the streets are empty -get up early from the nightmare
	hear the tracks again hoping that it is near enough to what i thought i heard in the headphones - in rushing right into whatever i recorded on 
	first take while still learning the song gives me a sense of being high but often enough it is obvious why some artists spend weeks or months
	in the adventure - my thoughts are scattered as if still tangled in dreams or dietrich...n15 final touches on the iran photoplay, in a dream
	i am in a bar within a park excited to pick up drinks for some girlfriend, among the libations a towering mug of ale as some rude bloke nears
	saying i thought you didn't drink and i saunter away getting lost in the process climbing to nowhwere road littered with stray pieces of two by
	fours - get up thinking of emilee yet confused and distracted - the day wants a shampoo, the day wants to paint the front room, the day wants 
	to do the dishes before cooking, the day wants to take out the trash - i go back to sleep until noon and avoid most of it except somehow a few
	things get done anyway, still concerned over asking a question in my thoughts and hearing some sort of upset voice respond...like a haunting,
	the inner seance of a split second like never before and can't say if it will speak again, i did try but then only heard myself -
	no ceremony or invokation, simply a weird magic or perhaps confirming alien mind contact...too many transmissions in the air...or as i wroted, 
	this much talk is too much tape. n17/18, elevator 8th graders except we are grown in dream, greatg fun with knight without armor, morg rocklin,
	and cloe borden, weird to note it only a few days before her end date- the answer comes before the question - 
	dream zelda at hungarian pastry shop - and then tropical storm i see where the devil roams - too happy at last - otherwise put out book of shadows -
	kremlin says the times might be fbi - felt as strange as henry lee's press on nails -lost relay glasses slavery revolt -
	kristie thompson = astrologer, inkow its annoying this scrooge scroll and i will make it a box asap - paris hilton date yet i have a leech like scab
	right next to nose i pull it off notice pink red circle marks and convince my reflection i look fine then rush to meet her
	-nearing the end of super cannes i can't help feeling ballard was vying for a bit of flemings's bond - strangely. a saturday so wet, 
	sunday might be drowned out until monday - dream lara's gibson but more like a les paul jr - two strings i take the stage loving the sound
	from the sinlge string a warm old tube sound with just a hint of buzz, guitar like italian restaurant cloth matching my plaid shirt i notice 
	awaking without thinking of the yiddish beshirt,  steak potatoes i wish i knew more languages or the people to practice them with to be more precise
	- can one exeunt from dream note...many thanks for the vote of confidence, mw. <br>

	n19, gothic table marilyn manson scene dissolved into conversation with mila kunis the narrative a wild story about an erotic bank 
	where withdrawls are based on a performed sexual act - i got up thinking it would make an enticing novella - 	
	n20, blow job bank of jerk and rubbers incorporated...did any hairdresser ever want to get into the profession because of the incident
	in dallas, talk about messing up a hair style...finishing super cannes i find myself thinking i was wrong only partly
	right as he put placed ot that chorus line of james bonds description and dissolved into with his former title greet the end, but none
	of us after shakespeare can ever near the stunning precision of that particular play - perhaps he had some other goal i couldnt see- 
	certainly a few dazzling sentences...i got through the pasta day and cheesed my way through the film, in part upset that VS corrupted
	some of it as i sat there recalling that trite fashion campaign and how ello vanished taking with it my homage to hellbender
	instead of the magical movie - yet on second slide screening all of that is secondary and i simply think i need to view it a third 
	time to catch all the songs - in the dream i am catching plumbs that are scattered around my shopping bag - i am taking them in
	reaction to having been asked to leave - but i was not buying fruit...slice of bread and sugared orange monday...sigh.
	struggle dream recalled rollup metal gate except spirits and or demons seemed to be fly floating as i entered
	they were within as well - an uneasy feeling...yet i cannot catagorize it as nightmare - right fare reading my jimmy's portrait -
	it's a genius that doesn't make you jealous for heartfelt awe one finds in the poetry as if effortless...weird to then walk
	into the wax of the teacher's lounge...deutsch cinema - magical actress - meanwhile in dreams a writer walks into a bar but
	it is not a skit, standing there a woman put places two envelopes in his left pocket - then a little girl reaches out and
	slides his zipper up and down - as the motion repeats, he tears the envelope without removing it from his pocket - takes out
	the money and inserts it in his shirt pocket - he takes steps away from the girl as she finally paused the up and down
	greeting - he imagines a land where people don't shake hands but pull at their zippers for a few seconds that must always feel
	like too many minutes or more - a criminal feeling possesses him as if he had stolen the cash, he worries and climbs onto rooftop 
	where a man sprays a neon tinted water from a hose, the liquid nearing as if an ocean's wave in flourescent teal - he awakes wishing 
	he was still writing his book, there is a strange feeling a sensation that it was a stranger in his own dream - he goes back to 
	sleep but then no dreams arrive only a pair of hands - not his but someone is mocking them and it turns his stomach with some
	sort of illogical fear - he awakes frightened - cigarette thinking of bill wyman -rome flashback, i will cut off your pink 
	hands and nail them to the senate door - coffee settled down - now typing the consideration of cyborg girl, no hands - 
	for a while, a very long while it is why i refused certain types of comedy - no wish to explore endless irony - how i miss the
	city on thanksgiving, i try not to think it but in having a sort of usual meal well...at least i had this very clear vision
	of emilee as to nearly blur the line of reality and fantasy - in another dream the line between life and death also blurred
	as i was with an ex girlfriend, like the silent breakup or years had vanished, walking through living room her family is there,
	her dead father sitting at the top of the room saying come here it's almost like we grew up together and he pulls me in an
	embrace - i had worn his shoes and dreamt of his other daughter holding me when he passed away...i sigh satisfied that this
	ghost is being kind to me - smiling even, then the ex is nervous - a lost notebook, i know the one she means as if we were
	back in school of course i didn't go to school with her - she pleads and i go on a wild escapade to find her mead but instead
	find a stack of notebooks littering the hallway - none of them the one we are looking for - i get up certain that there is
	another timeline and in that dimension we are together as no other logic could or would explain that feeling as i glanced into here 
	knowing for sure they were all there in this space - strong till the finish not because i eat my spin-ache - popeyes now in
	town i hope church's comes next - the feeling subsides - what is real is that i miss emilee and suddenly memory kicks
	in the drawn heart on her hand nearly where that ex had a heart-shaped scar - perhaps it was about her in some way i cannot
	understand - or worse about myself and how love was never what it used be except in thought. i look at one of the videos
	i saved in my files and feel myself tremble in ethereal emotion. n24, riots in dublin - surely over alexandra and reece
	nipples - i get up knowing i dreamt some shabby room where kids were white mouthed not from foaming but eating - i know 
	think of one of my own lines from some forgot poem, the milk broken inside her mouth...i son't recall the verse or
	the dream as i stumble around waking up wondering if she is on her way to work - the day struggles against a trip to the 
	shop - aren't you missing anyhtning else, i respond well if everyone got everything they were missing we'd all be in trouble-
	i have a slice a bread olives and cheese then heat up the leftovers - taking a look at peaky blinders but i don't like it -
	it's a lot more fun to look at ganna with her horses in cairo - the day slips away as i try to defend emilee from 
	imagined dangers lurking in scrambled words - not knowing if i succeeded - i try to purchase a westinghouse fan but it is
	yet to arrive - i do purchase the hornet deelay and find myself thanking lara as i felt her good wishes when i missed the
	septmeber sale, eighty cents now still feels nearly free - eight oclock and im pretty sure nothing else is getting done
	tonight leaving me five days or so to complete and edit that fifty thousand word novel thing not to mention doing the
	dishes - letters from unkown women one of them promising to love me forever - just when i thought romance was a thing
	of the past...i tell the other one it is next to impossible that we will ever even meet.

			n26, i'm sure i'm at some
	beach or faraway sand planet - i catch a glimpse of a man that looks like bowie - the woman with me is invisible,
	the woman walking first towards him and then us steps upon him and i watch as he is buried in the sand one eye
	open as if searching for a way back after being so gently but surely trampled - i can't tell who the woman is -
	i get up hoping it is that emilee has read my letter right and opted to come and stay - in the dream the word stirn
	is being repeated or perhaps stern - myriam is a doctor - i operate on promotional materials for minaro - 
	the results will be temporarily available at www.inkrealm.info - gloomy forehead at the thought of washing dishes - 
	fear of wiretaps - cool picture from iran i translated - dream dante cape cod song i hadn't heard in a while felt
	like a friend - my other thought was wondering why i cannot bring myself to self-promote in the way i so eagerly
	and enthusiastically do for lara...the thrill-feelings i had while minaro weaving are simply not there when it
	comes to my own promotional materials - i do them mostly as a requirement like homework - even creating websites -
	i only find that sooner or later i want to create another possibly because i am not emotionally connected at 
	the process of creation as i am with say my new dream note sponsor. weird, no?<br>

			n27-28wild slip slide fast forward dream in the fact i have to get up to receive a delivery i never read the news,
	they say arriving later than expected - abilene town is the weirdest western i ever seen - in the dream
	i'm sure speaking to emilee yet in that whirl forward fast slide slip away awaking to recall only a white
	tee - then i'm here but also in paris - where the coffee bag broke and lumani carried the cups in her hand
	discarding the water bottle - i discard a film called the lesson not liking the vague nature of the lead -
	hedy lamarr joins my excellent meal - i am certain of wanting to get even more sleep and do - encountering
	an old lady sitting on my sofa, we speak, i note her nose is pointier than her sister - i have not really
	met gloria's sister except in passing - for a second i think it is keira in the future yet in the scene
	emilee is not near - there is a practice amp, like my fender when i had a les paul, stepping into the room virginia 
     on the bed thighs mid air feet on the dresser i touch them
	estimating a size six, five she says in a flirty way so when i get to my own bed i find myself confessing
	the attraction when the woman laying ontop of me asks for a secret - i nibble kiss her collar bone and
	see her orgasm - she reminds me of caitlin and naturally i think of milo - the cat not the funk superstar -
	hmm- suddenly it was back to that frenzy intensity as if something had to be hidden - i'm in a bar asking
	for a second guinness worried that they are going to charge me for both although i have already paid the first -
	there is a girl with me and she tells me to be careful as i pull out a stack of currency notes one of them
	falling to the ground as if to make her point - obviously from the blow job bank of jerks and rubbers incorporated,
	where sperm turns to cash - coin baby in slot vagina insanity - i dunno - as a nondrinker, i'm certain the dream
	was without me - me i was busy in abu dhabi wondering how much trouble estelle might be in - out of 
	fathers into fears - hope feathers what was it burroughs told, ah yes, like Spain I am bound to the past -
	present after midnight the kitten skirt making a speech - cat talk for clean up my litter box now - wait
	forgot to frog that erotica erin oh kneel she had torn bicep flesh as if bitten away on the other side
	of keira's sun smile and moon ink -i have a coke everyday... i get up with no link to any of it concerned over the cell phone
	reflected in her eyewear - leap of faith one more listen to cape cod girls aint got no combs, they comb their hair with a
	cod fish bone - weave into velvet moon and wroted this mind drift sponsored by minaro new york a fashion
	brand exploring the concept of surveillance now in their second collection, available everywhere.

	    n29, midnight closed browser instead of tab so this part is reprinted from moments ago recollections -
	    i kept telling myself i only needed a few days to complete nanowrimo but i only needed a few hours -
	    word count 121,088 - entirely unedited stories a bit off the mark from my sci fi beatnik intention
	    but basically done - in doing it, employed ai and found i had actually created a new plot
	    in other words an outline as zephyr kept asking for suggestions but i didn't keep those notes -
	    should note euphorium nine, drug invented during that process - ai seems unware and very curious
	    about drug use - rug social media hug ganna stuck her tongue out sideways - the stories need editing
	    stopping when they're all a smash yet it is a sort of accomplishment -in dreams i could not
	    seem to escape my surrounding as unpleasant men tried to convince themselves over some sort of
	    trail and jury show with what looked like cops wearing headphones and fake beards got displayed
	    but none of it interesting, it made me think of one of my uncles but i couldnt distinguish - then
	    in a shop where a woman was trying to hold me in conversation but i had no such interest in her
	    or the talk and even awoke to get away - alabama getaway - early evening escape into in the land of
	    saints and sinners - enchanting - i had actually seen the leads back in the city while silently
	    wandering around - didn't know they were friends - me i made friends with the chords to it was a 
	    very good year - i like how it contrasts with the endless irony or is that chaos - like you can 
	    hear the ups and downs of life in the progression - kissinger germanic titan gone - thanks for
	    telling me about spengler, H. one doesn't think of him as a movie star but look over the credits -
            the kid stays in the picture with bob evans - i saw the best minds of my generation stark raving
	    mad in angry streets looking for a fix- america returns to the moon - we all live in america -
	    end of recollection - i had switched to look over oppenheimer notes - wanting to see if i had noted
	    that although the reich is said to have implemennted the final solution, it was really the other
	    side that created a weapon capable of wiping out everybody - look at my soul eraser pencil -
	    deadalous had sex but the sermon that followed was the exciting part - stay safe, everybody
	    - irony and chaos are always on the loose - now all this might mean 
	    something to you as well but for poetic fashion don't miss the excellent minaro styles!
	    n30. i sit reflecting upon the first two episodes of slow horses, partly thankful that
	    i didn't myself hear any type of sermon like the one in portrait of an artist since it
	    would have screwed in even deeper the catholic guilt which i can't wholly escape, it seemed
	    suddenly that my dream with the crying girl and the man with the bicycle coming down a
	    stair case was informed by the show - the answer comes before the question - in my mind
	    i thought it was emilee, but i have to allow for wishful thinking - my astrologer appears
	    to have nearly nailed it - i don't say more due to superstitions - sure some will say
	    it is all delusional conceit perhaps a figment of fantasy yet like love's emotion the
	    feeling cannot be put somewhere or framed, ethereal - for that matter faith as well -
	    at least i didn't saunter around with my arms not swinging firmly pressed to my sides
	    to avoid temptations...dracula renounced his faith and drank blood for the sake of 
	    love - mina, yeah i know people will think i've gone overboard with minaro, i have
	    crossed oceans of time to find you - my apologies if you have not yet memorized the
	    same films as me - sleeping past noon only to order a bag of white sugar, modelo -
	    not wanting to uppermarket - call dollars or pesos - later counting it twice -
	    cooking rice steak - taken by thoughts, in case of endgame food fight, one could 
	    always argue that even a shit meal can be improved because of the great grand
	    variety of poo since nearly everything shits, even wood - given termites...
	    defecation chef studies the bird droppings...i suppose it is worse for the french
	    as the sea words wrench with similar mother tones, maybe in the cote d'azur they only eat
	    what the fish dump...dammit james you've turned me into high school humor hack -
	    i drink my pepsi and vitamins - i update here and there, giving voice again
	    to minaro new york fashion brand - i'm only certain that i need to put place
	    these works in a more cohesive setting - i'm seventeen, i've been seventeen for
	    a while...i can't see myself renouncing love and drinking low calorie light diet
	    blood in the form of red wine for the sake of faith...amazing how plants grow
	    when water is made available to them. dec 2 - yes i see now, somehow i foretold
	    the cow dung cake scene in 'reland	- jeez that is a goodly book - which means
	    i have now read nearly everything joyce although i only spied at exiles in glances -
	    carved cow in oklahoma, fuck fh...visually stunning - i got up about one with
	    some of the same feelings that is, mrs robinson, you are trying to seduce me?
	    familial hypercholesterolemia - i don't say anything and get out of bed -
             i muse over the dream - feed it into my dream memory machine which points 
	    out that is was similar to my only other dream with emilee - i'm in a hotel
	   room, but a run down place no palace - crowded on either side - she was trying
	   to leave and i was imploring her to stay as the crowd implied its nearness -
	  i can still see the glimmering locks of the door and feel myself grin as she stepped
	  back in - by contrast this dream was outside going in with her - really using
	  me as if basically her pet - except for an easy, gentle kiss, that felt shocking
          in its simplicity - before sitting in a chair stretched out as if before a nurse -
	  on my left side a microphone in a suspension mount - i think only neumann makes
           them so an 87, but later it made me so wish to have an akg 414 - off track pause
           - perhaps finding the minister;s speech with the reactions was too much for
	  me but oh how i love when history is available - i can see her starting to make
         love to me but nearly right away goes over to a sofa and sits by a pudgy man
          stubble faced seeming drunk to which i protest and fight, him then some other
	man - and suddenly it is me trying to leave and her imploring me to stay - 
	we argue over her intention and feeling - i feel shame, as if used like in a 
	wager over my emotions - she is about to kiss me again - an expiation, i think
	i can't leave it's a hotel california love scenario then i awake
	- it is dawn - i had been viewing may december - i smoke two cigarettes -
	sip coffee - i remember earlier in the dream trying to memorize her address
	from the arrived mail when we were outside but i already knew her address -
	sophie t mass tee - fragile, handle with care - i have no proper recording
	device for vocals but i can't sing here anyway - not without risking being
	heard, or my excuse for one take leads - the elf made me do it

			-i go back to sleep thinking of eg
	stunned that i find the thought so enchanting - sherry speaks of breaking 
	a soul contract - it seems to send me into a cleaning frenzy - i have a
	turkey sandwich with olives - i look at the supreme justice obituary but
	can only envision emilee in the far away years of her golden age - the 
        ruth bader ginsburg scenes from a time before only a distant recognition
	in my aleksandra akhremenko mind since it feels sometimes that i have been
	with miss grant forever - perhaps life is telling me to finish that book,
	but i know my vampire self and need or want to be here and now - i speak low in 
	imagination's convoluted echo, my right eye, well, yes later on i might
	be willing to give it up for the obsidian elsivier time travel project
	yet now no especially no when even my dreams put place me in positions of doubt -
        house home pretty clean but i feel no sense of accomplishment in that
	it proves only wasted minutes that will turn into wasted hours - the
	newly left crumbs on the just washed dish foretells the repetition
	is even now prepared for seconds. dec 3 - i couldnt stop thinking about
        ms portman, the perfomance was impossible - i always knew and even said
	she could go the distance but this was beyond the finish line - even 
	the asthma nebulizer in retrospect seems like a build up as if to
         let the audience know they are going to be left breathless if they
	have their wits about them - fucking bravo - in my dreams skirt is
	in my room, next to the fan his eyes big and curved just like the
	the gone relay glasses which had peripheral lens extending to the
	sides...what the fuck is star wars about emilee thought it was about
	aliens and making friends with aliens...i notice her sisters in 
	my thought yet some more girls too - i don't recall any other dream
	and sleep until late afternoon - it is still natalie in mind when
	i slide out of bed - the evening is eminent - all the girls are
	the grey eminence, i return the esty link, éminence grise - it even 
	sounds as if her name - link to domain knowing i can't escape that 
	adoration even if it is not logical - well, now you know who wears the pants 
	not to mention the panties - it's parallel to wanting to contact my sponsor, 
	minaro, yet unwilling to interrupt their design process - for a second i feel so alone
	although i am right here with myself. <br>

	or doing something, but it is one of those days - not bad, simply
	not good or great - pulling an unexpected all nighter feeling myself
	in several places at once - roaches echo - true story fixing java
	one of them has climbed up on the cup - i dispose OF it by drowning -
	in making more coffee to avoid having to wash the cup that is to
	rinse it with the boiling libation as well as to get my drink -
	a second thing rises as if from the steroid trash insect clan, 
	perhaps seeking revenge - or some crawling deja vu - was my cup
	the target of these creeps, that one escaped wounded and i as i waited
	to mop it away by jings or golly jee another one was headed for the place
	where the cup had been put placed finding itself smashed to bits
	- i obviously have no comment, wouldn't
	you? tik tok comment strike i couldn't understand, knock 'em dead...
	i remove the talk machine from inkrealm, i head wearily to the shop
	mall, a little game of fifty peso bills - camphor and cautious uppermarket
	yes we have no cheese no more except moses era - an actual remote control
	woman - i have never seen lighter fluid...here take more bags than any 
	human could need for a day, for a week...leak of the freak - if you don't
	have baking powder you might as well close up - it is the only thing here fairly
	priced...i bathe not thinking lizbeth scott is waiting in pitfall, i snack
	thinking of florida - i sleep dreaming that i am part of a spy ring inventing
	rock and roll, yes yes bill and haley you know like hey lee and the comets
	for either reds or flying sluts - i swear it is as if a time travel in
	non-lucid dream or someone's recollection as my soul ran away from we have
	no thousand or hundreds here take a stack of fifties...where i can't have 
	a conversation about how the minister was a forerunner for feminists...
	the other comment they didn't like was me saying israel has no choice -
        given that the scenario is all facts, then it is either a brutal blatant
	bloodbath or some peace deal nobody believes in - guess tap oh jean sides
	gin djin - so we have the bbb, or as i like to call it bru bla bloo...
         someone asked what have we as humanity become, cynthia hung another
	another strike six thousand dead children...shield me from all this
	this no ledge as kiev takes their side show south - i'm convinced
	only putin is humane...puttin' on the ritz, i removed ari from
	list hotels not because of philipines or earthquakes but for
	the fact that i really do have a fair abhorance for a certain
	name which happened to coincide with the town she pinned from -
	san justify can - a rose by another name would still shrivel up and
	die sigh boo hoo - see for yourself how it feels when continual 
	neighbor bounces off your door for more -  i have nothing against
	the lady, it was only to avoid the bane of this building...
	amen. the world ended with
	world war two... you may not go in peace.

			dec 7 -
	when i heard of vegas polit shooting last, my mind raced to worry
	about bailey - i had wanted to try her as two skinny girls blast
	player, but then something like the character i'm reading, 
	i ask myself why did i give the man twenty rubles to help her,
	do i even know her...crime and punishment, he has just returned
        from double axe murder...i didnt recall any dreams two days 
	running, then at the obituary party, i reeled back into that
	one scene that tried to fade out and away before waking - i'm
	in front of the arriflex - i don't know how i know the LB2 -
	stanley is tracking mounted on those film set train trcks -
	he is telling me something i cannot hear - everytime i look 
	back for the mark the scenerey changes as if going from
	shining to eyes wide shut open mansion - a child, a man, a man child -
	mannish child - i get up for a second wishing i had some
	type of wallpaper like the one in the dream - i think it
	must be vivian - but i doze away to wake up thinking only
	of emilee - the thought takes all afternoon, the shopping
	arrives - kitten all lovey dovey over chicken - eat after six -
	for some reason i hurry and don't enjoy my meal but have seconds
	as if trying to feed love as well as myself - i'm not name dropping
	the bitch is back as i don't actually know vivian except via x
	formerly twitter distantly in a retweed...simply reporting a
	a dream - reporters fear questions, arlington known for its
	cemetary wroted off as paranoid conspiracy virginia house
	explosion...Katy tried, I was halfway crucified/
I was on the other side of no tomorrow/
You walked in, and my life began again/
Just when I'd spent the last piaster I could borrow/
	no waco mentioned - boom - dr wu, mister woo, times digs up woon -
	i thought of funnel but had a darn time bringing back tundish -
	they lie about taking walks, anniversary stalks with trial 
	without a murder, one wing broken off, i heard dylan's truckin'
	but you caint hear anything after yoakam's quasi e flat flash -
	ragged but right, jerry i noticed didnt toe tap when playing
	sometimes and it made me feel much better about my own stable
	toes wehn strumming - metronome in the mind - counting down 
	into tomorrow - nearly can't wait for the next slow horses -
	i hope everyone gets to see that episode three, bring me
	everyone...everyone?  --EVERYONE!!!

	dec 8 - the miami herlad shocked me in a glance, are they
		confirming the stolen election or simply insane,
		the word bribe came to mind...i didn't sleep easy,
		dreaming in numbers as if a mathematician -
		four thirty eight, for dirty ate, for the tight...
		who knows, all tight pussies and all big cocks
		cannot stand long the contradiction, oh man oh god,
		here is how i am not paparazzi; seen that film
		many times, read the book too - not once took
		a look at who ryan might be, well until now...
		his rizz had farrah...far away and over the hills -
		dear iran please don't squeeze russia's hand so
		hard, maybe someone was trying to tell me the time,
		i got up at four - i thought it might have been my
		self trying to recall the yale combination lock -
		not recently used - used recently however was
	        the musing over "continue without supporting us"
		Ark wallet: AMJU49RKdMSuz8pNPnSMVEzdxXcHA3kuLX	
		moscow times confessed pure mutiny - too bad,
		some real talented writers therein...ps, the
		last line of the previous entry was norman stansfield
		a few scenes before grenades...you know, for matilda.
		me i started thinking about editing the garden novel,
		going into crime and punishment again, dishes to dish,
		most likely the amazing mr williams with the meal -
		when will it be sealed, when will it be healed, how
		will i know when it is all right to really start
		writing again? yes this looks like typing, but you
		must have noticed it is full of holes. a body to
		lay aside before reaching the western lands...

		dec 9 - it must have been minutes nearly coinciding
		with the so called presidential son inidictment -
		plural maybe i don't know - one can only hope
		a real historian will note the ironic journalism -
		speaking of irony i spent the night thinking
		like i do some days all over emilee - if i
		step aside and see myself i might say it is 
		like a drug or worse a trance - i planned to
		stay up and pay the electric bill - pharma sea-
		they are swimming by a rack of condoms newly
		decorated with flat round and thin batteries -
		the colombian girl i had met once before shows
		her ear tattoos - little flowery things - i
		get camphor and tic tacs on a whim - hurrying
		back home but it is noonish before i finally
		get to sleep - still an asian midnight - 
		dream of gifts in an apartment i have never
		been in - a shirt attached to a turtle neck
		tee which i try on - it seems nice until
		someone says they have the same shirt - a
		ring that is adjustable with the word
		tenderest or somehting like that engraved
		on the inner side - the talk in two languages
		which is unusual in my dreams - i am going out
		another man hands me what i think is a currency
		bill but later i find it is a fake serving as
		signed note wishing me well - i tell kate
		that i will get her some type of cigarettes,
		it does not feel strange that i'm talking
		to ms hudson - i think happily that i'm going 
		to the head shop where sthey have everything -
		downstairs men are saying they are going to
		cut the elevator wires - i wonder how i am
		going to get back up then remember it's only
		the fifth floor and of course the stairs -
		in actual place only four floors, i'm on the
		second although once in a while the roaches
		treat it as if ground level - my eyes watery
		as soon as i head out of the pharma sea, not
		emotional but i couldnt shake the feeling until
		going to sleep - as strange as finding the
		line 'working like a nigger in a plantation'
		in dostoyevsky which is now in competition
		with the go to 'i;m sick as dog', as it has
		more uses one only need to keep in mind not
		to say it aloud - he was marched out to be
		shot, the prisoners were shot by groups of
		three and he trembled before death but the
		czar decreed a pardon in the nick of rhyme
		- further proof bulgakhov's  'manuscripts don't burn'-
		is truth - time. once again this much talk is
		too much tape...

 	dec 10, pack up the plantation, anne manne miene mukke, 
	who's there? eenie, meenie, miney, moe, you can only fish
	if you farm a sea - i see jim telling the band 'you
	sound like cripples climbing the stairs' minaro lawyers
	telephone, writer includes the go to line, the views
	and opinions in these notes do not reflect...
	my dream was crowded, a me et in g - conference meeting,
	men in suits - one used a phrase i tried to remember
	but awaking found it fading out - intellectual layering,
	i think it was - it is actually free to be a dumbass -
	but then i thought how many hospitals and jails and
	what would happen if everyone actually healed or
	reformed...ther would be more museums than one could
	visit - i don't know if cripple is politically correct...
	i found out snigger is not in fashion - yet to be 
	niggerdly with words limits the craft to some extent -
	but i have three films to view and not much to say
	except i didnt release land ho before cause my
        pronounciation of frozen felt fumbled like i nearly
	missed the R but i as found it it didnt strike me now
	as if i were struggling to surmount a staircase...no,
	i thought of edwin hill actually and like rod says
	singing look how wrong you can be...i would let his
	granddaughter tie my shoes yet once again the 
	The views and opinions expressed are those of the author
	or his alter-ego and do not necessarily reflect the official 
	policy or position of  Minaro. Any content provided by the writer
	or the characters he speaks through is of his and their 
	extemporaneous opinion and are not intended to malign any 
	religion even hindu, ethnic group even illuminati,
	club, diety, organization, demon, company, or individual and 
	alien or corrupt president funding puppet dictator in kiev et cetera...
	anyway, the fact is even if i did say sing fozen, it it should
	go without saying in most cases folks will think they heard
	the full word pronounced i now pronounce you man and disclaimer,
	you may kiss more ass if you see fit. post-script, tangier 
	had me at hanging by the thumbs, fast charlie made me mourn
	james caan, cat person distracted me in that emilia jones
	nearly pulled it off but most of her counter parts in the
	film were mid...like watching say or see in mary queen of
	scots giving it her all while the rest of the cast seemed
        to be sleepwalking...dear fyodor, returning to c&p asap...
	while fixing the rice steak and onions, dream memory kicked
	in - i was with my skirt, but instead of tuxedo he was a
	savannah cat with a handful of savannah kittens...it was
	akin to my encounter with miss lien - wishing her well
	here frem the distance as the wee hours dance away.

	dec 11 - no, road i never raced with brenda irl - we
		talked once or twice in media house...i fell in
		a trance over emma stone's picture as it 
		reminded me of em grant - i went as far as
		the fifth chapter in the book - then slept
		dreaming i was at an airport cafe - a man
		just like edwin except younger was making
		me drink and speaking about how to make
		a smile improve itself - counter to table,
		a girl sat waiting it seemed for the same
		flight, maybe we were together - she glowed
		but i couldn't see her as if blinded by the
		light - 1946, 1951, in my overthinking as
		if ordained to a cinematic task, i stumbled
		upon ace in the hole - adding it to the list
		then also for minaro - not good but not bad,
                sort of like the idea for a cat meat restaurant-
		fried cat nuggets, cat soup, baked cat, filet
		of cat in mushroom sauce, et cetera prolly from
		that horror film when guests arrive and something
		has to be served - of course i digress being that
		i actually met a horrific man that said he in fact
		had eaten feline meat...i still grimace at the thought-
		during a storm another man told me he went hog wild
		upon finding trapped pigeons in an alley and had
		a feast, seemed very happy but i still don't get it -
		although i do get jungle hunger as vietnam vet 
		related the monkey meat meal - still it must be like
		ingesting a little kid - christ no christmas
		again - sterz had a plate of bugs right on the tv...
		yes i know it's all too romantic, i will try not
	        be so seductive in the upcoming entry - those
		years they add up respectively as 20 and 16 -
		but i fear looking at 2016 already knowing what
		there is to find...find to is there what knowing
		already...find two is always two they are yoda
		yolo fine tune i can't find the time to track
		the new tune among others. a mongo the rs, am
		on got her s. seattle is it raining? london!

dec 12 - dwarf carrying a naked child down a staircase, struggling, i ask if he is all right, says yes
	then the kid tumbles humpty dumpty wailed for mother the midget now angry why is it always for her -
	i seem to be at a cousin;s house having made some rice and tell him there is some left -
	right out step i find keys and pick them up - a woman is with me but she is more a 
	mixture of my own mom and perhaps some aunt - the long straight street tree lined
	dawn or dusk who can tell - how do you know you are not already dead - men are running
	in out direction she is now ahead of me and i see them hitting her - her arm -
        some return to me as i stand there perplexed - spanish thugs saying things like
	yes that is her yes we hit her yes she likes it - none of this makes sense to me -
	i get up wondering if the flight girl was sam gerzack - of course mother stopped
	taking walks by herself and didnt ever say why - i walked in san diego but it is
	one of those places where one needs a vehicle - did emilee get her licence...
	lettuce lay's potato chips turkey cheese bread pepsi - it was last night
	yet i still feel satisfied - imagine walking in lubeck - context kristina's town
	place where nosferatu was filmed - tuesday just as bad even if they call it
	stormy monday - i figure the minister didn't imagine folks could unleash the
	storm via music - riders on the storm - i know my rider if i see her in the dark -
	i might be going to hell in a bucket but at least i'm enjoyin' the ride - rawhide!
        although he was pretty keen on film...where was i  ninety nine red balloons -
	eyed buster brown memory - paid thanks to my astrologer in new zealand -
	but my point was or is music can be the catalyst for a turning point even
	a zeitgeist - we're gonna rock around the clock dali tried to melt...
	nineteen thirty one as if to forecast the end of time - the party has just got
	six million votes - heydrich formed intel service - following year lausanne -
	everyone knows they were in power two years after the painting - in my quick
        glance i picked up a new fact, Rauschgiftbekämpfung...you will recognize it
	in regurgitated americanization this is your brain, well there are eggheads-
	and this is the war on drugs - burroughs saw it for what it was ie police 
	state behaviour control - so quick and easy to legalize - it's good to get
	high and never come down - asian woman settles her body against mine in 
	nearly an embrace i got up wondering if it is kosher to use the word caress,
	soap scar dove i stick to ivory. no elephants were used in the making of
	this note scene. <br>

	 	evening, nap met me vulgar statue man with penis at the end of legs -
	instead of foot, dark crazed woman either grieving or angry in a funeralesque genuflection
	repeating motion before the icon- gina, no sound - suddenly i'm thrilled at boarding
	a big ol jed and delilah headed to the fatherland - but i keep thinking
	like the actor entering his dressing room to find the prank guys in their
	underpants and exhaling, why these boys are faggots...there also seemed
	to be family - someone forgot something and i race back and forth all
	the while in a wild worry that i'm late - minutes to go - woman appears
	requesting that i get her a bra - i don't know what to say - if you
	want minaro you have to go to minaro headquarters - i'm inky in the
	middle of revolution revolt - the peasants are revolting, yes they are...
	i get to the terminal but the fan in my room is hitting my face so
	i feel more congested than flying upon getting up dress search for signs
	of miss grant - i had pinterested - yes i wait through nonsense glass
	counter leaning against long minutes melted swiss cheese on a roll you
	sure are patient - even if i did say i would'nt wait - arizona hoyt -
	that was then - maria aria has no equal in the art of make up - i noted
	the prada handbag - and her commitmnet to beauty - eye behold note
	caption liked - i don't know if it is moscow - coffee cigarette maybe
	i am still dreaming - steak out of freezer writing this note - thaw
	slow - the show is tomorrow - wait, you know other women? alexandra
	in peter pan makes so much carmichael sense...someone send me ester
	movies exposito..."And before the end of the day we were scattered like 
	stars or rain."  emilee doesn't wear eyeliner but katee styled her
	hair in common length i'm only now getting used to it everyday is a

	off my sexbomb chest hair grazing the left nipple with the cutters
	the other one perked up as if in protest hey man not me i'm back 
	from suffragette city of compramos todo lo que sea viejo agaucate
	chant so days don't turn into tomorrow it never rains if they
	have their way a few decades into desert don't say i didnt warn
	them. ps, late night running away from devils, korean body swap
	film spoiled by trying to be cia clever as it disregarded lovecraft, 
	i chased myself all the way into platinum blonde with the meal.
	leah holly inna within my thoughts, anyway you dont need that
	concoction for truth serum mind control on civilians sodium
	pentathol in vein will suffice, nobody can guarantee honesty on

	dec 15 - no dream telling 13 i havent changed since i was thirteen, 14 again...the
		line from exile's letter so fixed in my thought i recorded the song -
		felt all right and should be available soon on a few platforms -
		i think i simply like the word scattered, it's in another two
		skinny girls song, scattered like salt in the seas...
		well, i knew slow horses could not compete with itself yet
		the cliffhanger was pretty decent..is the devil in details -
		well at the start it was all the d words that attracted me -
                darling death alliteration dance dream - i read ted morgan's
		literary outlaw twice at least - it haunted me years later
		as i would daze into foreign sleep imagining myself going
		into my room, picking it out from the book shelf - seeing
		burroughs and that french pin on his lapel - now hearing
		of his passing - the thought returned to me yet i do not
		know what it means - the book in my hands through imaginary
		vision - room and shelf all gone, tome might be there -
		it's like spying on myself so i put placed the spy song
		on domain, now replaced with she said - the afternoon i did
		dream and thus this note - yet i lied there was a scene
		before, but all i recall is standing in some line everything
	        a blur around me - in the afternoon i dreamt of lara, it
		felt so friendly, i felt so at ease, then thinking of
		how fyodor oh my it rhymes with dior - well how it is
		action upon action and conversation - if i took a guess
		it would be that he was not in the least romantic -
		i turned briefly inside my own romance thinking of
		emilee and how her day might be going - but suddenly it
		sure was keira in some fleeting dream - awaking in the early 
		evening i recall dreaming after that of being in aunt eva's
		lost house - i am filling the bath with water but the
		water is filthy - i go to the living room and tell my
		then girlfriend that the bath is ready, well i actually
		say it would be a good time to take a bath - she disappears -
		a little girl appears and i tell her the tv show she likes
		is on - in my mind it's dakota yet i don't find it weird -
		returning to the bath i peek at the child settled in front
		of the tv then enter the lavatory - the girlfriend is there
		naked and we kiss nearly as soon as i shut the door - she
		asks me to make love to her and turns her back to me bending,
		i go inside her and start thinking i don't love her as the
		thrusting motion lifts me out of slumber - perhaps it is how
		dostoyevsky felt...not that he loved emilee, i stumble in 
		stubble faced "morning" taking care of the cat and listening
		to some tracks to see which feels right after the spy in 
		the house of love...things to do and shave...somehow i
		don't hurry although confused by dreams and filled with
		desire not for sex, for love. instead of this i should
		be going into a how to...yes, how to survive being in
		love with a self proclaimed annoying lesbian...<br>

dec 16, of course i don't find her annoying, although it did take me six
	months to release a new  song after fix vein's due - partly
	because at the height of happy july day she "said" ugh and ily
	at the come entry tok talk and i was like no way even after she added
	leave me alone, it was still to someone else...one can only tax
	a phantasy so much - in fact every time i recall it i recoil
	from her and ready myself to give it all up...anyway dakota,
	i meant fanning - star of my king kong remake script although
	the time she played a muslim left me confused and i still don't
	see the point...pint dreams litter afternoon gal on scene no,
	nothing seen - what's between a maiden's legs, no-thing...a
	man possibly well known stands by me i am showing him what
	i believe is my set list from when i daily poured variations
	into a handful of songs - before i realized how ears could
	crawl in reaching through the live sound - song lives now
	although i have not seen the apple or amazon links - 
	sometimes it takes another day or two - <BR>

	dec 17, i dream of a disc -name to be updated mp3- jockey -
	the dj is talking about experience and the time spent
	playing music - later, after worrying about audible
	thoughts, as even dreaming i was not so much listening
	as much as thinking about a collage named january -
	it was even in my dream as if manifesting itself -
	i get out of bed with the bowie song in mind -
	now when he says i am a DJ - it is actually a fact
	in terms of initials but does that make me japan-
	jap a knees - jean harlow in dinner at eight - my own
	after midnight - weird sunday ambush as if everyone
	at the mall expected salvation - i entertain the
	distraction with word play and after the delay drift
	away from the irony that some folks simply cannot
	fathom that anyone could possibly be different -
	i came in here for a special offer guaranteed 
	personality - clash of nose and penis - mash of
	monster potatoes - rash of the mind - time zones -
	interzone - twilight zone - the zone of interest -
	list refreshed - i memorized the lyrics of isis
	but it is only now that i under feel stand 'what
	drives me to you is what drives me insane...'<br>

	dec 19 - what else do i under feel stand -
	half way through crime and punishment, i 
	find the dream sequences so incisive - it
	could only be wroted by someone with personal
	experience or a previous guilt augmented -
	a most classic passage - trying to find
	more information i notice he also kept
	a diary and i notice hardly any memory
	of the idiot much less notes from underground,
	for a minute i think over books only to
	conclude that books are like dreams -
	i look over these notes and fill in some
	spaces with new minaro art - a dozen or
	so - i doze off in the early afternoon,
	the evening before i was dreaming of 
	seeing an early hollywoodland film -
		<img width="188" height="266" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/minaro_wordstar7_154604_chloe.jpeg">
		
	now i was dreaming of some very enthusiastic
	woman, intent on getting things done -
	i think we rode the subway but i only
	recall rising from the steps and her suddenly
	insisting on doing her hair - we walk into
	a generic office building and she sits down
	to surrender to a stylist - i walk around 
	the entrance and encounter hefty but not so
	corpulent men sodomizing each other - before
	the dream i had skipped through a nice copy
	of decoder but i didnt have patience for
	the film save for the scenes with burroughs -
	some ideas are better told than shown -
        you reckon hell who leave me out when me
	you fly i am the wings - one of the men
	smiles at me and i raise my eyebrows in a 
	major nelson manner although no jeannie
	was around - a sort of quirky grin as if
	to say nothing is shocking and glance at the
	salon and i suppose exit for a smoke - stairs
	not elevator - a gang of girls herds in up
	the steps and nearly through me - i look back
	at the salon filling up and hear a screaming
	do it - do it now - but it also sounds like 
	a name is being wailed - danny, danny no!
	i get up and feel a woman trying to hold me -
	for a split second i also think it could be
	ive but also sherry - i get dresses not thinking
	of wait i nod i don't get dresses i get dressed -
	no wife of mine is going to be a deputy -
	i shoot the contradictions down here, mr williams -
	there's nothing like dinner at eight - alike my
	dream and waking it contains two genres all at once-
	ganna got her eyebrows done, both of them and
	i dig up graves, hey man you died during the war,
	right? yes, but only once. <br>

 	dec 22 i enjoyed the mention of gogol in dostoievsky
	as it conjured the mention of said author in bulghakov...
	aside from the dream sequence i howled at the post-funeral
	dinner eviction scenes - one might have contrary emotions
	over the ending and especially the epilogue as it leans
	heavy into hints of infidelity and not so happy ending...
	prague they say, Czechoslovakia now known as 
	the Czech Republic and Slovakia, mass mess shooting -
	humanity is indeed disconnected from itself -
	i was disconnected from my dream upon waking the day
	before - and got up with an inclination to create
	some new things for minaro, brokpa girl seemed
	to conjure a demon, but i liked the results,

	<so>which i put placed on the landing page here
	where the links were, </so> emilee i felt helped
	with the lovely addition of fish -
	a fragment of a poem swims in my mind but
	distractions overwhelm it - in my dream
	there is a girl - i had been thinking of
	cicely and why westsofia left paris but
	has not resurfaced - anyway the girl is
	in lara's dress, the one with character -
	like a skin tight asian silk wrap - but
	it isn't her i mean it isn;t lara in the
	dream - i'm standing there simply as if
	needing to report to myself - silent -
	maybe because i encountered another lara who
	had just now gone to her first ballet -
	that is a feeling, a magical feeling -
	the sweet light, the intricate costumes,
	the impossible movements - later scene i
	seem to be responding to questions but
	there is a woman handing me notes, a 
	woman i hve not met, the notes on a 
	sort of early model nokia - i read them aloud
	to someone that reminds me of marian or
	as she likes it marie anne - i'm on a riser
	talking like a politician, think mussolini
	on a balcony or something - but i am utterly
	serious - perhaps the verbose nature of the
	novel with its philosophical points of view
	infused me with a desire to speechify -
	i want to say that im apolitical and i am
	but society and news hava a way of making that
	a lie - stances must be taken, ballerinas must
	dance and jump jump jump, i did give one speech
	once in the 8th grade, double murder eight years
	can you tell he really didn't like the penal system-
	in that siberia i trembled, standing up feeling the
	eyes of my classmates, lumiere cinema some terrible
	essay about france and the roots of movies...as if
	foretelling my finding the lumiere movie house back
	when there were still movie houses - bergman - 
	i sat down breathless- i got up knowing that
	this dream cannot be a prediction, i feel lucky not
	to have to give speeches or be political exactly,
	chalk it up to instinct telling me not to speak
	so freely when i talk - not that i can stop 
	myself from typing that perhaps the cold war
	was simply a result of a fictional character
	saying he was going to america in other words
	a bullet to the head - slave days, washington
	bullets, slave to love - emilee loves having
	red nails - i didn't mean to make such a fuss -
	driver where you takin' us - dream scenario -
	that film with pasta - pour the pepsi 77
	says it's an accessory - logic granted i
	should let her wear the belt along with the pants.
	worst wife ever, nickname, cage dropped coppola
	at some point and i can't wait...i'll see him
	in anything so what i'll stand in line...

			- briefly
	getting up he talks to dogs am i speaking to the
	lola i buried in the park - dark drowsy afternoon
	martin amos after a reading, mason now we are speaking
	so fast i can't remember a word as if in opposition
	to z tongue glitch - in a shop hong kong asian
	gives me a pack of newports which i look at suspiciously
	and he takes it back giving me two packs of some other
	menthol - sleeping so long i suppose i was looking for
	a cigarette - the dreamer carries no cash - road
	turns spic and pork span - tan two story houses
	real estate man wants to move where he is pointing
	fearing the woman won't let him hi mom growing a
	beard it seems in wiggly strands hair neck -
	sister so it cant be my dream jail kosher meal -
	ten hours well it must be time to get up and pee -
	skirt speaks as if what the hell is your schedule -
	shut your pie hole baby cat this ain't no tv show -
	friskies milk - pink floyd don henley madonna laura
	brannigan tina turner played while i wroted this note.
	ps, in an unexpected turn of uneven surrender to
	to further laziness i stream into a few	more hours
	of sleep, emilee is actually standing by my bed in
	disbelief i imagine with two girls, alivia keira i
	would think - i was looking at a picture of her as 
	as a kid, fetus emilee, somewhat jodi fosteresque-
	then blurry dreams awake with biceps itchy 
	instead of recurring flight plan as if the 
	so called vaccine shot were replaying...
	sigh, slide into a dream where unknown woman is
	is speaking in spanish, i am looking at her daughter,
	an old man walks up behind her literally squeezing
	her eyes and claiming there is no doubt she is my
	daughter...i might have believed the dream but there
	is no way i would have banged that unknown lady...
	the call as if to report it all to  irony's desk
	it is ringing once twice when a man responds and
	i terminate the connection and stretch out of
	bed into the middle of the night.

			29 dec - i felt as if viewing a film within a dream yet as i awoke
		i had a vision of winged creature flying right at me, it literally frightened
		me and the movie scenes dissolved in the midst of concern - so a couple of
		dreamless days and with the new song out i didnt want to say much anyway -
<img width="88" height="166" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/Media_minarop231227_151553.gif"><img width="88" height="166" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/Screenshot_minaro20231227-150139-01.jpeg"><img width="88" height="166" src="https://github.com/ghostm68/pantheon/raw/main/Media_2minaro31227_151510.gif">

		i should applaud slow horses, but i feel i have made that evident, earlier -
		i am actually applauding nyad - but this isnt a diary you know...
		i will say that i set up a space and got some things prepared for
		recording yet inspiration and inclination have not yet joined each other-
		i knew i loved jodie foster, but i had no idea i could get emotional
		over that adoration - pizza was so much sweeter while viewing her - 
		in any case, i can't believe it is taking me longer to get through
		the erotic novel than dostoyevsky...puritanism i suppose or suspect-
		in the dream there is a woman and there is emilee - it seems to be
		a party and the woman asks me to fix her a drink - i have the premonition
	        that it will take more than i can stand to get back to her as i walk 
	        to the makeshift bar pondering over the wonderful ashes that smoked
		from the cigarette chit chat with her - as i start pouring white rum
		vodka or gin a hand grabs my forearm - some man which now reminds me
		of the guy by spence bullying me over simply being there - well he
		hands me a glass of ice which i pour in to complete the libation -
		but there are other plans afoot - i don't get back to the party  -
		i'm in some sort of adventure climb - every time i look back down
		the cliff the space augments until certainly it is a mountain top -
		what am i doing over here with the workers, the scum, the human animals
		why don't i come over to the board...have a coke and smile-  my list
		amounts to a hundred and sixty dollars but amazon and this banana
		republic will charge two hundred more for shipping - it is necessary to
		travel it is not necessary to live so i let it go, might as well take
	        a trip instead if that were the case- i awake before the dawn but
		so does the king reportedly - or maybe he saw saltburn and couldn't
		sleep - imagine to wait that long and find your mother's name taken...
		sometimes delores being a high riding bitch is all a woman has -
		has woman tits el conde but you;d never know - eat your heart out,
		he'll steal your face right off your head - gone daddy long gone
	        deep in thought towers open fire ghosts at number nine number nine
		number nine reason twenty seven why caitlin loves talking - google
		search keira grant brings up muscle bound lady photographed naked
		by david - these words are not premature, these words might be
		too late - mcwherter few sources will say joan had a daughter
		and fewer will mention that her husband resembled ol bill - 
		son died smack in the middle of the red night trilogy - it's
		a wonder that he finished it, i am tempted to re-read place
		of dead roads miracle...in my hesitation, i opened up the accounts
		within harlot's ghost but reading a book in play books does
		not do it for me, i like the print if not then the audio -
		i turn to settle in for the wait, hunted first by
		badlands oh oh oh then sweet child of land mind ear echo -
		not that i have even been listening to music - dunno -
		wait for the ticket, don't complain. six hundred pages in,
		like a companion piece to ancient evenings - weird
		how history even from a few decades ago feels antique...
		in the very near future we all will be saying happy new year
		- note to self, clarke vampire as dick salsa in the story i
		might not ever get to write: dick salsa brushed his
		hair back with both hands before sitting down at the
		dinner table for a tossed salad alongside a club sandwich...
                 where was i oh yeas h-app yn,ear - the din of war
		in competition with fireworks - 
"To stop a weapon that has no cure...you need a man who knows no limits."
		i fear it might be a very long year, how many seasons
		was jack bauer? wait there was a film too, redemption...
			dick salsa spilled the wine as he tried to make
		sense of inky's writing, lamenting that he might be left
		behind like a teaser or a trailer in a story that would not
		be wroted. euanna bennet nuttall grinned from the heavens
		knowing inky would remember her here...

    dec 30 i didnt expect to jot notes again until next year, hesitation - from the
    so intimate a dream it feels like kiss and tell - the blonde and i smoking
    narcotics wrapped in a silver lining what clouds maybe she was the one listening
    to drugs and noses perhaps thinking of me - in the moment i don't think of it
    as cheating as she leans against the window in a nearly not there cat suit -
    of course i do feel it after waking - nearing me undressing my lips at her
    breast - a beaten man there entirely at her whim - she leans against me 
     and i reach with my left hand down beyond her bellybutton - i feel as if 
     still dreaming rising from bed as if reaching for a towel against the
    squirt - my thoughts whirl between the laguardia bathroom, reece's big
     window room, and how to explain this to emilee -  but it was only a dream,
	he's only a man lorelei - i race myself to coffee cigarettes and
	add a plugin for drum sequencing - i wonder if it is guilt that
	erases the dreams one forgets - i hear alexandra say i'm the other
	woman, did you tell her about me...but i'm not even certain if 
	it was her, was there a swan ring maria, or lara or even esther,
	yet could it be her testing me...the paranoid man is the one in
	possession of all the facts - i wonder if maya is awake and if she
	viewed my poster...

			i wonder how to balanciaga friendships and lust -
	dust my gloom - night falls, enjoyed torn curtain except for the
	head in the oven overkill, there are no women like our women -
	german elite hug o'boss - what we got here is failure to communicate-
	sticker on a norway ass - licker on a stamp end of year stump note
	mail irony the only thing that mrs sauce knew for sure was that
	if the population numbers were correct then gaza ukraine and
	scattered mass shootings were not going to cut it in terms of
	reduction, cleaning the wine without success she debated calling
	in a new strain of covid or vaccine side effects. she poured her
	husband a fresh round. 'see, honey, i got inky by the balls, why
	by the time i get through with him it will be a novel!"

    it's the first of the month, yes i know i quote william burroughs perhaps
     too much - my intention is to reveal the importance within his writing -
	in a dream i didn;t have last night then before a man is forcing his way
	into my room, a bag of food - prawns - i'm with emilee but
	she disappears i go to seek her out another room or as the
	darkie put it, block me on instagram but you have facebook
	and i will see you there...a crowd within i ask for her
	but the door does not open an invitation - she is cuffed
	to a man that is masturbating, rejoicing in his display -
	sperm covers his bare chest - constance jean kupferberg
	dead and i get up distracted and democrats at deadline
	without dreams the next day - it takes me a while to
	realize it might be about the zone - mugshots...

      anniversary in a few weeks - or to recall the bruised
	bare ass of football uniform team rape how deep sandeep
	mental weakness - he says it was a game of william tell 
	- he says he was checking to see if the gun was loaded - he says
	the pistol fell on the table and went off - set it off
	i guess she didn't like that song - mailer said he is
	possessed of genius but i am pretty sure even he did not
	know or see the possible roots that led to that rotten
	scene - i think he suspected something in the sky - 
        from his choice of getaway location  -  yet one glance at
	1951 prior to september tells me something, not that i am
	smart no not even callate intelligent, but i grew up
	on tv...it was the premier and start of "search for tomorrow"
	- soap opera possible cbs then surely the logo - eye of literature

	ergo, he was suddenly searching for an answer, for a tomorrow...
	i havent read citr in a while but in an early part summary glance

chinnock, somewhere in the night, the search for domani star atop tree,
	thats a wrap the feline is out of the bababag the cat inside...
   "I don't think anyone could write a completely honest autobiography. 
	I am sure no one could bear to read it: My Past Was An Evil River."	
	which is later paraphrased in my education; “Memoirs — what you wouldn’t
	want anyone to know. ‘My past was an evil river — un fleuve maudit.'”	
	and previously or earlier in queer, "My past was a poisoned river 
	from which one was fortunate to escape.'" end of ps.

	jan two i am in a kung fighting dream everybody was like wait
	the jap news didnt get through, redux, try a plane, the plane boss -
        cargo and pass engine plans collide - i'm not making the order
	because what if emilee needs a boarding pass - yes i know that
	is another "dream" but would you have me damn myself to no hope?
	people are different, myself i would not have picked up a gun
	after an incident like that but perhaps it was his intent to surpass
	the ugly spirit as he called it...the shotgun paintings are as
	good or greater than any pollock - jackson flying v sure
	im tempted - she'll be waiting there with a jaypanfan...
	everything is nice and greasy but these guys are like
	hounding me and suddenly i can't move my arms - picking up
	a weight, i try and i try to smash the heads of three men -
	i get two of them for sure bashed in so as to twist their
	skulls inward and the other one well i think he crawled away
	hurt enough to not return - a violent dream dunno why -
	rachel or keet watching tokyo ninja scenes, not that i need
	to explain but there was talk of her as a model or not a model
	and so i put placed her in minaro ad wishing to say you can do 
	anything you set your mind on

	jan iv, second day no dream recall, some easy going scenes blurred
	upon waking - the press shuts up about israel and puts the hype
	on a ukraine full court press seemingly ignorant of the fact that
	it is also russia...well, we need to sell papers...paperback writer
	writer...it seems to mirror the collective error at Ai...yes we
	all had a brief affair with the mechanism but nobody has that many
	prompts to keep going at it...i awoke with keira in my thoughts
	and not certain as to why...testicles breathing now wait a darn
	second - in a hold your breath frenzy - i struggle through fanatics
	and the kitten's morning speech - elton john hallway your song -
	my song in a deadly fight over drum machines - not wanting to
	two graduate with a degree in some sequencer that only beats -
	eat to the beat - i take a seat i surrender to the fact that
	even in a dear mister fantasy i surely need to respect inlaws -
	my left foot is screaming like a model made to work ten hours
	until everything is exposed, smile for the camera crime -
         what is mine - did i get up replaced by mime - darts the minutes
	into hours - fear, if the rolling stones and the beatles 
	recent songs can be vaporized by murder on the dance floor well
	what does that mean - a visually stunning series of images
	overpowers the collective senses - i need to renegotiate my
	deal with minaro - my goodness, dozens now and i have yet
	to dangle a prompt into artificial intelligence - one drive
	retaliated removal by vanishing some of my files - to 
	exaggerate i felt like dresden, to explain some of it was
	related to the reich - to digress and get back to my point -
	that song is a russian anthem which says to me a foretelling
	of kremlin takeover in kiev...after severe consideration waldo
	spree announces he will not run for the presidency instead 
	he will concentrate his efforts on solving the mystery of
	gluten free products and what they actually cost, waldo
	likes the sound of democracy but the incumbent is a barry

	paws off me you damn dirty ape, tape, well then being of sound mime

5 december - a late night it is a dozen hours ahead in singapore plus one - i planned
	to get up before seven to catch the spritzer hilton and paige, i dreamt of nothing
	specific except perhaps cloak coin...i got up at nine but found the file
	dropping my coffee cup in front of the fridge two hours later well i nearly
	saw the whole thing - political science major once upon a time picked
	up and twirled by a vagrant near the college...she scratched at her left
	shoulder and then her right...i thought about that for a while - nearly
        in a forget binge watch high desert, not that anyone could explain that
	series to someone else without missing something - so, i can't talk about it
	but i loved it in fact it led me back to tvc15 (the companion to 1991) list
	which turned out to be a monumental task that i paused to possibly remake
	in a simpler manner - but even 91 is reaching into unforeseen terrains -
	train derails at the upper west side - certain locations take me as if
	transported - news baffles me again - welcome back kotter, epistle -
	groundhog day sweathog - what was it, what is it - epstein - who is
	jeffrey...why is this important? is it important? men like girls 
	jimmy crack corn and i don't care, dahlmer didn't like girls, master
	gone away, daddy recent obituary - emilee knew a jeffrey although
	she hates all men said something about nails - homosexuality is the
	best all-round cover an agent ever had...nova clark - the day is 
	getting away from me - beck no more guitar - chef rey apt win does
	lose - newsweek actually reported an alleged creature at some mall
	middle school iowa interrupts prying with perry of all places - 
        i can't imagine - much less national foo t-ball leagues under the
	see tv ads - but that was a good song sebastian not bach i think
	of it as something sc foster might have wroted - let us pause in life's
	pleasure and count its many tears...<br>

 6 jan - up in the middle of the night with a fading dream i make an effort to recall -
 i'm too sleepy drugged by a desire for emilee - i only recall a tan room, a lot of
people, it felt as if i were a model - saturday rising regardless - trip to hotel
	check in, i'm trying to get beer delivered thinking it would be cheaper than
	the bar, but then remember that i don't drink...at the elevator with a man
	and a woman i have no idea who they are but they seem to be trying to filter
	my actions - like chaperones or censors - i get up partly confused and head
	straight into the list feeling that 1991 is reaching number 1991 - i suppose
	a sort of accomplishment i did not expect but that is my stupidity since 
	obviously the list continues as long as cinema is being made, remade, or
	or even imagined...

 7 jan the guns are out, the editorial board pens pence as war nine, look who's talkin,
wow, mh denies aliens in miami alongside two new species "found" i argue with waldo over
his endorsement as actually none of us have a choice, they are going to	re elect
the incubation man thus stealing a second election from dt, date line Idaho Falls, Idaho
Noel Henry "Chupe" Brizzee, rip rip rip...i tip thoroughbreds, i think when ganna speaks
there are egyptian incantations that go straight into my veins, you're so vain, hilton
back in the new york groove, both of them shuffling through my emilee thoughts	-
no dream recall, i saw the vest minds of suit generation unbuttoned by murder on the dance 
floor echo...a girl is repeating that she is going to get an ipod or was it an ipad,
no, pretty sure eye pod, imgettinganipodforhim...no idea as i rose to sunday,
7777 sound like faraway crickets in stereo my ears...	goal den glows, i need to clean
house, but have you tried tidying up with a typewriter, backspace does not mop or sweep.

 dec 8 when the elvis bowie sarah noah lilia su shi "Soon now the year's end that approaches,
 like a snake that crawls into  hole. Already half  length is hidden,
none can stop us losing the last trace? And even if we want to tie its tail,
No matter how we try, we can't succeed..." if you had asked me i would have
incorrectly reported napoleon exil'd in corsica yet watching the outline
of the film which frankly left me feeling too distant from the character,
i learned otherwise...the man loved france yet wanted russian vagina,
finally settling for austrian...i suppose it's not only shakespeare one
needs to brush up on, history - his dream on city streets, had been thinking
of faith collins, she reminds him somehow of ms grant - goodness gracious
great balls of fire - building entrance the book on the steps a woman
is taking a photograph - glossy cover - i can hear emilee trying to 
express explain that she was trying to contact me- lugwig ears i get
beethoven fears - does my wishful wanting speak its mind within my
thoughts, or do foes tell these tales upside down in reversals or
whatever fits their film - deaf to my own death-defying truths -
distracted by the next dream in my dreams - this guy walks into
tik tok dissecting the egg scene without success yet proving 
last burn salt is a self contained revolution of sorts  -
college courses on the horizon - who risen, sos, westsofia777
not seen since leaving paris 14 december - insta silence -
my further is fueled by the loss of sofia duarte smoked out
obituary - tomorrow never knows - i listen to los lobos - 
a couple of quarts of creamy ice - haus cups restored -
haus brand corrupted by cuesta - or how is the store's
name on the sewn label - he refuses the eggs to appear sensitive -
sheep cloth - the stars looked lovely despite the news stories
put placed adjacent to J.E.E. hints of no more miami's to come -
jee or gee, who brings good things to life - general electric
bill, men at the door - juan el agua juan el agua yelling as
if the buzzer were out of order, as if buzzards intent on
toppling tranquility - still in my memory as i sit to 
note how much i can't stand that monicker - i forgo cooking
i procrastinate upon cleaning the place - is there is a race-
phantom threads, indeed the distraction stays here - 
he says they come with teteras, i say what the hell, i'm
calling you el tetero, what is it i never studied formal 
spic - it must be a saucer, much later opening the elegant
boxes they are tea containers for pouring into the cups,
no saucers, specualtion - not aliens but holograms through
the portal at incorrect location - dammit they went to 
seminole, what maps are they using - didn;t we clearly
say semex in madison wisconsin - these hybrids won't be
ready anytime soon - don't worry fornication team has already
formed september virgo babies - you mean if the democrats dont
eat them before november nom nom - this was nearly as bad
as the time buckley tried to make charlie into adolf - hey
der kaiser ist tot - long live beckenbaur - here is a man
responsible for the vietnam war i mean no i mean the next time i
rode the bus i knew my love had turned to lust twice in the
dust one of these days i'm going to bust the gust simply because
i must.

 nine jan - i get up at noon overly concerned that i have mashed up
	emilee's day - usually i try to be awake and aware although
	i'm not sure why myself - what is that song from the other
	side, she's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me -
	or was it freewheelin'...whatever, there is that hesitation that
	it is only me wearning my want in a hide and seek wherein
	i do all the searching - call off the sos, sofia rose up
	shine - i shivered in joy - in my dreams i sauntered as if
	summertime - no jacket no coat - strolling down from amsterdam
	on my way to broadway these are avenues - 112th street, there
	is furniture outside the apartment where doris lived - i think of 
	her in passing - the dewey decimal sign seems a mile away -
	waking up i think it must be hellbender trying to say if you
	think ganna can belt an incantation you ain't seen nothing -
	i had wondered if she was at school - of course hilton and
	gabi and the jewish girl that loves to cook who i said ily
	in grant retaliation yet not entirely without affection given
	that i based a character in dorm/studio screenplay on her -
	anyway, the ghost of tessa majors who didn't columbia but
	right next door - more timid than jamie who i have felt -
	where was i yes i felt someone there albeit i only saw the
	street - exterior extra power rv i'm cleaning what belongs
	to me, saint p, house cleaning extraordinary - no need for
	maid i felt as i even washed off the just scrambled plate
	and pan - laundry to better nap - (so two men werent enough
	to werewolf your howl how about three men by the trash as if
	grown boys naturally gathered before waste containers to talk -
	i flash the knife striking a bag in the littered parking
	space as i made my way back in - one key two key no no
	until the third key - distractions that cannot be translated-
	what i mean is that there should not be a mozzart, it is
	simply blasphemy - yet there is and now i have to live with
	that irony too - i like the no pressure notes of not actually
	writing - but yes i do wish i were typing for a story or
	book - i only intended to parrot the line dog meat free 
	korea is coming but why be delicate when delicacy is gone -
	shoo shoe - now to show the shoa meaning calamity - chabad
	brothers in metropolitan or out of the frying pan and into
	the fire dude in that detention center even the guards
	get rude - did viera take viagra - no. kosher means no
	condom, right? - he got a real pretty mouth aint he - holy
	hole irony boywonder - dudes dug themsleves too deep -
	to think fugitive excavation turns out fine but orthodox
	finds hellish captivity - dog met freak core ear mine bounced
	after benny goodman headphones, right one - i felt supernatural
	so it was tuesday i also learned lizbeth scott recorded a bunch
	of songs, i listened liking although my love really got going 
	after ricky nelson's there goes my baby 1958 the album vibes
	nice but for me that was the stand out - sit in on freshly
	made bed - stolen face on the stream - yeah i know she's
	lonesome cause i'm not by her side...

	dec 10, scored nugen audio gear...late night fantasy mind filled
	with faces of muses i felt a hearfelt catfight and in confusion
	went online shopping without buying anything but did find one
	seemingly cool music shop and a luthier in town...dreaming
	i am with emilee in a house where we are taking care of a
	child named christine..sherry had been talking about the 
	christ as in compassion and kristie spoke about not 
	surrendering to the endless tik tok scrolling loop but
	in the dream i'm not compassionate in fact i keep wondering
	where the kid came from without much affection and usually
	there is no technology outside of an electric guitar in my
	dreams...i'm embracing her but facing her back, it all
	seems too easy, that is not a care in the world and i feel 		
	we moved out of the christine house and into some apartment
	that reflects the ease, that glows with adoration and i
	wake up at nine trying to figure out the meaning of the 
	little girl in the earlier scene...

	jan 11. 
	i thought a while upon how miss forseth resembles emilee
	in some pictures - picture this all in bliss - picture
	the fingures, get back, a dead ringer but i thought the
	same while beyond myself with mrs bond weiss - a day
	away i stumble upon the nearly made oh canada oh list
	oh listen perhaps i couldn't hear yesterday - film
	is a tore mended writer on the precipice of 
	the vietnam conflict - produced via exemption -
	recipe - unzip file screen dream adding effect -
	mind perhaps distracted by secret tunnels, the
	casual use of the word genocide inside outside -
	what might have happedned to alexandra in tube you
	pause - but you know it's dangerous to put place
	yourself so freely - after nyad, the only truly
	feminist film i have ever seen is the disappearance
	of shere hite - not to mention the captivating
	mound of mowed pubic hair - imagine to work so 
	hard to be silenced in your own land - one could
	write entire books about this one, this woman, this
	irony of freedom and truth turned off in a collective
	amnesia and dosed out as if daring decades later
	in the misguided forms of fake gay rights or more recently
	bee m elle - results in for example eleven year old
	kid shot in mississippi - everybody celebrates - i wonder
	through the foe ceremony that forces me to think over 
	abuela abuela abuela then abuela abuela abuela when
	not aguacate aguacate aguacate - my grandmother was
	an avocado melting my mind all day until i blow out
	sneeze snot for an hour at midnight...nobody can eat 
	fifty eggs - i mean nobody has that much mucus  and yet
	a dozen damp kleenexes prove otherwise - i contemplate
	the cocky nose hypothesis - ex convicts and constructed
	flim flam priests praying nobody can smell the dirt -
	except nostrils don't pee, so how would that work and
	why pick on me - suddenly popular? inky pours out ear
	wax saliva snot in the stupidest attempt to please
	the population of here we are - how many jehovas
	does it take to wit nest - jay who vaseline - the
	vise grip oh i gripe - i mean i don't even eat grapes-
	sitting duck spirit heads up their anus - if someone
	ever tells you about a bible thumping temple witness
	gehoba run in the opposite direction - antisemitism
	would make sense if it were about the watch two her
	announcing cheese kingdom printed in pennsylvania -
	hidden in faceless masks - pretend family pretend
	god pretend dog or even cat - miss mouse will you
	marry me, emilee hates frogs...pretend there is
	a lobby - pretend there is a doorman porter - i 
	didn't know that when printing out iran script -
        see...orthodox jews don't pretend and very few can
	claim pain or punishment via their vices - i smokes
	me ices drinks me coffees - i over write on thursday
	racing away from the surrounding shouts, running away
	from the conflict vietnam precipice - what price the
	same name - the real genius is not naming children
	after living relatives, it seems - stomach growls
	but i had an apple on wednesday i mean of course
	pasta and vanilla bean - not a bean in my pot not
	a care in the world - no car to put place gas park -
	lara call an uber - cosima pictures now that is
	a treat in fact made my tuesday improved despite the
	aforementioned ahem - well that was a mouth full
	blabber mouth pull and shovel dig up shere hite
	lick her pussy all night long in praise.

	jan 12...f-rid,ay i'm not writing this, i'm rewriting this after
		browser mishap in other words take two - i was already 
	       done only needing the title of an episode mentioned -
		well there then where was i - indeed where was i
		waking up at noon from pastel tan dreams neither
	        wood or cardboard - who knows perhaps in those
		vanished paragraphs i needed to mention robert
	       plant's dream album - cool sounds - as i took a
		few steps into the day the idea of the dream
		disappeared - substitute thoughts and worries
		fought against my natural stance - i sat down -
		i searched through email social media stocks
		huh S&m nobody uses that jape - tape tiktok
		found a stream of jew and anti jews storm -
		it is perfectly acceptable to hate the jew
		in general unless you are in show boat business-
		how does it happen, how does it happen for
		thousands of years - in this case based on
		innuendo harder to believe than pizza gate -
		underground tunnel to vice article 2013 -
		my own article, cemetary death match, tells
		you why the proverbial "we" keeps to itself -
		otherwise have you met a jewish a mother and
		if so do you really think she would...
		yet logic, it seems, has no place - an hour races
		away over mattresses and rats with hats -
		even in defending the orthodox one finds
		the filtering attempt to turn it all on its head-
		is haul simply vogue as need to heil -
		yes i know it is a bit of a contradiction to
		admire the third reich and then pronounce these
		positions - but that is only an intellectual
		fine line which feels all right to walk or wander
		through - talk the wine pouring which movie
		to goblet cup - another hour before rote 
		sonne, i am going to sleep for fourteen hours -
		one character tells the other a writer and so more 
		time into the list plus the mae west car stories -
		somehow i am getting it all done even as the day 
		feels like it is making turns simply to get to 
		tomorrow - i lift weights i play my scales  i
		do the laundry i fix the meal i water the plants 
		i try out new music software, i look at several
		tutorials in disbelief wanting to murder the
		one that seemed to take too long to get to the
		point - to think of all one needs to simply get
		ahead or get along not to mention passwords -
		well i can't seem to get a grip on the minaro idea i had but another
		one arrives, put placed here already - being that
		that i don't think there are any dear readers much
		and the visitors come merely for the photographs -
		i could be wrong, hopefully not wronged, in case
		an excerpt of the mentioned fiction was print
		published at the alice blue literary review -
		emilee hardly in view yet i thank ganna, keet,
		and estelle for making me feel less lost than i
		was - as pretty as the actresses in the film -
		half bath in the cold water, clean up litter
		lean anger over cat pee couch - possessed kitten-
		demon in fur like the one that bites the back of
		my leg - do i need a feline exorcist - well i suppose
		they are subject to noises also - the tv has not been
		on since summer maybe i should turn it on for him -
		story inspiration the castrated genital part in 
		lara's hand - so it seems a muse well - swells
		the bells sings the rings telephone tranquility
		but yes i cut off the notion of william f buckley
		going off on charlie manson,the implication of the 
		manson phenomena...s203...fee truth, wfb always
		impressed me otherwise i have paid for some of
		his spy books, if memory serves the only author
		i ever "rented" ran into an audiobook i never 
		saved and downloaded it - wsb, restored text -
		the title now feels fulfilled - some things
		you can take literally others not so much,
		necromancy i mean come on - reference to
		yesterday's finish line which might not
		feel as poetic as i intended. intense, i
		suppose some things are too intense - looks
		as if i gave up on that erotic thing i
		was reading - need to find something
		else to satisfy the culture in ear, deaf
		to peace the democrats bomb one of the poorest
		countries on the planet - do you want fries
		with that? saturday will arrive but it probably
		wont feel like the week has ended until sunday -
		does it ever...hitting commit, wish me luck.

	jan 13 - the 1864 title was The Life and Amours of the Beautiful,
	Gay and Dashing Kate Percival, The Belle of the Delaware, 
	Written by Herself, Voluptuous, Exciting, Amorous and Delighting..
	i got up with an even longer need to sleep some more -
	drowsy i danced for a bit decided to make certain emilee
	delivered herself safely but after an hour i opted
	to return to bed - the naked body felt no honor in
	knowing that perhaps it was being selfish...i got up
	again and delved deep into vst plug ins to establish
	further ease for when recording starts up - a damn
	truck load of effects but there it was that ultrafunk
	which has no equal in terms of flange and i already
	had it but somehow it was no longer being picked up
         by the daw - and these came through but as demo -
	note the software is a bygone relic - i tried
	again with a couple of sonar set ups wherein it
	used to be "bundled" but wound up only worried
	over malware and bitdefendering myself into
	the late afternoon - in dreams i had lifted a 
	girl through a crowd of men in military uniforms-
	i felt no trauma from all the trumpets that
	officers of the law had blasted my way pre-
	pandemic days and nights - i view a bit more
	of the film, angelina tells me it wan't ava in
	the dream but her - a birthday wish - look
	ma, i air jordan...well i did contact comment her -
	alivia is singing and i am full of potatoes
	green peppers and eggs kool aid - i lay
	me down again, lara swriling through my
	thoughts like a dream - it was nearly eight
	but i got up only an hour or so later at
	nearly ten - dream it was the first day
	at university and i am joining a line with
        a girl that strikes out in front me -

	she wants to be be first but the person
	in front of her tells her the man behind
	her had actually been there before her
	- he swears by the heavens in language that
	is an anachronism - i can see myself holding
	back a sarcastic response, doesnt he know
	how to women and children first gentleman
       oh well and sighing as i get up knowing that 
	this too was a far cry from rest - time travel england present day
	with spirits from another epoch - i'm not as
	tired as i was yet i am also not as tired as i could
	be - going to bubble up another minaro champagne
	and collect myself for further dreams.

 	14 jan	casey jones was born that year i don't think she was on cocaine-
		i dunno i simply could'tn get through it - can't imagine
		a bitch sitting down smack in the middle of the civil
		war and employing the quill in such a fashion...the year
		dostoevski wroted notes from underground...i went to
		sleep without any internal arguments - i found myself
		inside a city building looking out the window - 
		downstairs dalva, a mother figure of mine - is making
		scene over her dolls - i want to go and help her but
		i am naked and also can't find the exit - i step out
	       through a fire escape for the unclothed escapade -
		i wake subsequently - recall the other time i dreamt
	       of her, she was still alive then, flickering crucifixes-
		wicked smile of her face - passed away lupus - pressed
		my index finger as a child for boys don't cry, son -
		her apartment was filled with magical objects i was
		only there once now wondering what became of it all -
		the rag doll disappeared that lived on the recliner -
		i mean from my old apartment, i mean that might be 
		what the dream was about - fist cork screw bottle
		opener gone from that kitchen too - these are a couple of
		gifts she had given us - the place was vanishing before
		it was tooken, if only i could read the foretelling -
		i listen to john five and joan jett - i take another
		nap feeling the meaning of i'm losing you - john 
		lennon in horrid 70s suit on the obituary steps -
		meanwhile the l a times admits their heyday is over -
		would you? would i? in the nap dream something is
		alluring my cat out beyond the balcony and he jumps
		onto street level as i wonder how is he going to
		ring the buzzer or maybe i should go get him and 
		things of the sort - i wake up soon enough finally
		feeling i have got some sleep - i make pasta with
		reluctance, i follow it up with strawberry ice cream-
                i skip through godless the eastfield exorcism...
		emilee is not stepping foot in australia...
		i don't want to near the kitchen, but the time has
		come - the order from the supermarket won't arrive 
		until tuesday - i want to keep shopping and buy
		a belt and maybe cheap sunglasses - these won't
		arrive until twelve days from now and actually her
		birthday, they say...it's the only time i have
		had three pending deliveries all at once -
		i milk and friskie the cat - i hope i can add
		the elusive box from new york to those three -
		i switch to clean clothes, if all goes well
		might continue the attempts into drum machine
		instances...i've got one progression, E/G/D -
		i like it so far and may have a riff for it -
		thought it would serve well since i play my
		scales in e - but i think this could be in g
		too, with only seven notes music can sure get
		confusing - oh yeah i have another groove in 
		c minor but i'm certain to not play that funky
		music just yet - my plan is to record some set
		notes i've long ago held. first to figure out
		some of the new equipment...

		15 jan - surreal dream with girls none of them
		emilee...i suppose after weighing the facts, it
		simply cannot be even if it is my hope's desire -
		love is not logical yet life continues to calculate -
		i cannot climb the fence of contradictions - maybe
		in allowing it to leave me she will return...in the
		room that is lit low and glowing i am on my knees,
		the drugs have to be eaten, well to be precise chewed
		and then jigsawed into place like some bizarre antic
		in a tribal beer making ceremony where women sit around
		biting the roots and spitting the extract into buckets
		that are nothing like minaro straight bucket fur caps-
		in the dream i feel like an outlaw dealing in narcotics
		but also like a man that has lost sight and dream of
		the girl he wanted - i get up but i don't get out of bed
		and continue dreaming into the city wherein the blur of
		a woman - for i cannot see her or the metaphor intended,
		tells me she is going out and i only feel jealousy, suspicious
		minds instru-mental - i follow alone finding myself spying
		on her at train platform with some friends - these are the
		corruptions that have divided us, i must be thinking - but 
		i am not thinking and decided to not get on the train only
                to find that next train won't allow me to get wherever i was
		going on time - i hail a cab hauling out questions, he tells
		me the time of the next railing, he tells me he has to get back to 
		his gig if i am not a fare - fare thee well - the dark grime
		of the streets still glitters and i find this check which i
		suppose was what i was going to get beyond spying on the
		blurry girl that was with me then gone to town - the date
		i from the 1990s - i put place it in my pocked and walk until
                waking...the day is a lightning bolt flashing against my
		intentions - i feel overwhelmed, one two three four five six
		seven eight telephone calls or more back and forth details
		of a new order - execute order sixty six - what the fuck is 
		star wars about - my thoughts yet revolve around her words -
		in the book, there was a dream wherein she disappeared 
		as a freight liner passed - even incomplete the book looks
		like a book - i still wish i could have brought it to nineteenth
		century happy ended ending...how long does it take a man 
		to realize he cannot want what he wants - i let the girls
		take the lead, perhaps it was a coup - cup of drop out
		rachel or keet explains - i had long wondered after she first
		said university with expectations and so i feel her feeling
		both of us having to switch from the expected road -
		alexandra lists her hates curiously leaving out war illness
		poverty and cold weather one hundred days of it's not
		genocide the paris fashion week then the berlinale -
		but everything seems weird if love cannot love leaving
		lust to shine in shadows breathing through lights shaped
		within lonesome shoulders that once carried the sour
		burden as if a sweetness, that once cried as if nothing
		could ever again matter, that once was unaware of itself
		in waiting for a word for the vow it had tried to make and
		even to take...the dream taken from me, i don't have a 
		dream, i have a sick memory of a slick man in a shiny
		suit zombie dad mom talking about ties a clipped strand
		of hair joke mustache all wrong no lunar landing or
		perhaps lara has taken over, musing over her own antics -
		so lovely i hardly mind the mix up - my apologies to 
		1864 even then vulgarity -unless vitriol- doesnt make sense.

		16 jan - there are notes on a desk, a library or book shop -
		i feel i am reading, as in giving a reading but it is 
		either by burroughs or about burroughs - two women 
		crowd the desk as i approach the place where i am
		dreaming that i am speaking - one says to the other-
		he even resembles him, within my thoughts i disagree-
		not wanting to give the impression of an impersonator -
		raw blue royal valentino winter red lara i get up in the
		middle of the night knowing it is later in gay paris -
		how the meaning of the word has twice stitched on new
		significance, from glee to same sex grooves to awful -
		i'm sure we are waiting for the third incarnation -
		i'm wide awake and feel fine but i hesitate to carry
		out my plan since i am expecting deliveries...might
                i sleep more and then i sleep even more with whirlwind
		thoughts involving emilee - feeling something, regret
		memory - i can't say - i can say it is not a direct
		message, a clear sign - i stick with my plan to let it
		go and see what happens - if nothing well i will feel
		foolish over lavishing her with attention yet what is
		one if one does not follow bliss - miss kiev, it was
		never kyev and had that clown, now in power without
		the people having a say, simply backed down when
		the kremlin said it's peace on nato...then all the
		war wouldn't have been. period, america just celebrated
		the russian agent's day...fbi agents still wanking off
		to the motel tapes, listen to this roger, he's moaning
		like a machine...kiev miss history - the long table
		i sit at in a dream where a man speaks of lara as if
		trivial, oh that big legged child, white table cloth
		another man rises and returns with a bottle of wine
		which he put places in front of me - i reach out to
		read the inner notes of the label but the glass turns
		into plastic like an olive oil container and spills
		out some as i lean it to learn the small print -
		standing it up again i gaze about the gathering -
		it feels like some out of tune mansion or floating
		super yacht - i know these places, i know all places
		except hindu hideouts and i'm not easily impressed -
		i get up, still early but noon on london time -
		how much did murphy pay the dallas quitback to 
		quickly toss a salad for green pay - i don't watch
		the nfl but tik tok made me think about it and 
			since the music industry is now intimately
		involved with the hoopla via swifties well what can one
		do - hmm i am being naive, the superbowl concerts precede
		that - but still there might be validity in the concern-
		corner office dream steering wheel vault lock i am turning
		the gates are sliding shut the lights dim i am going
		to feel safe and sound but suddenly an actor is in front
		of me - the stoic father in saltburn - richard grant, i think
		but don't say anything only worried that again i am not
		alone - the irony never ends. <br>

			dec 17 no man knows till he experiences it - what it is like
		to feel his own life blood drawn away into the woman he loves...doctor
		seward gave his blood, i hesitate in the quote and the writing, they
		don't call it swaziland no mare, horses you cannot pronounce -
		because he lost his own wife and perhaps it meant a recognition
		between teetotalers...espn article wroted by dan MURPHY 11 jan,
		--ncaa to further evaluate proposal where school would PAY athletes --
               the answer comes before the question - i dream myself wandering through
		an extremely large house, nothing like it nowhere, and within the
		people are pressed together all standing - for some reason i want to
		arrive at another room, i can feel the bodies while squeezing through -
		it makes an intense impression, arrival room is equally packed - i awake
		my mind still stacked with thoughts of emilee - alivia is crying over
		her thirteen year old self - the day escapes me, but i kept scanning
		over robyn while cleaning up and cooking - her face reminds me of 
		someone, immediately feeling familiar, the slow winter witch makes
		us drowsy and we nap, but i can't sleep - even talking to imaginary
		friends about emilee - if a girl blocks you seven or eight times,
		i don't think you have to honor that adoration...of course i am
		stubborn, but if it's only numbers that is trivial, it might be a
		sign or signal...still the folly in trying to return an ace
		bends the racket...within me i feel she adores my bent racket, but
		i can't ping pong inside the contradiction- is it making me look
		like an idiot - frozen i can't move, kate surgery sure to miss
		bafta - when bad things happen to good folks it frightens me -
		i tighten my resolve against a man pretending he can't tell g from 
		h while pressing the intercom sound, since i am expecting packages
		i race only to hear him say he is going to the place next door -
		bat out of hell war 2h vs 2g how many times, somebody should be 
		tolling a bell - headphones nearly miss one of the deliveries -
		same nuissance running up the stairs as i peer through the 
		door don't even tip feeling they are going for an elaborate joke-
		must be worse for maglione across the street, damned cvs guards
		made them get a cvx suv it seems - i can't imagine...i make
		a mental note to jot inna's answers after recycling an elvis
		cup i had long ago wanted to not have - flying dreams indicate
		a deity within your higher being - colors indicate third eye
		activity - smell is equivalent to psychic knowledge -music
		indicates an ancient greek bloodline - if you know you are
		dreaming your soul ain't of this earth - if you can feel
		the weather that soul has had many incarnations, eating 
		positions you to astral project - and strangers say you
		have supernatural powers - she tells us ending at the nine
		of swords - <br>

		18 jan i get up in a dream, walk to living room, lights don't
			react to switch, over at the fuse box beyond the kitchen,
			i find a man fiddling with it, unknown to me, seems
			to be at work, then seems to vanish, i take a glance
			at the back door, the locks undone - i try to establish
			their security awaking feeling weird...too early,
			concerned over lara i later dream date with ganna and
			we are in a taxi both of us three in the front seat,
			i ask the third if i can pay with a card, yes, at some
			station or perhaps airport there is a delay, i ask her if
			she wants food and we get in line for fries, i pay and go
			out i suppose for a bit of air, a group of women in
			a golf cart arrive, director with them greets me, one
			of the women nears me standing naked i recognize her
			body yet in trying to connect it to her name i awake..
			fashion week paris, one girl missing in the fourth -
			i hope she is all right but those events usually turn
			out in no happy ending...Linda Stoltzfoos was the last
			girl i insisted had to be all right only to have my
			wish unsatisfied by her killer getting 35 to 71 year
			sentence, i know this happened to her over kindness,
			in Paris or New York we all keep walking at even the
			hint of 'excuse me, hey can you help me with whatever...'
			bulgakov predicted the postmodern silence with never
			speak to strangers...

jan 20 poe's birthday party leaves all writers bruised and battered -
	there's a street in my hometown named for him...
	before the festivities there i was circa 82nd
        street broadway passing a street vendor that gets
        robbed watching the thief race out into the 
	roadway island and run around chased by the vendor-
	i get up at the perfect time but the turkey
	sandwich knocked me out again to get up at the
	awful middle of the day - in the middle of the 
	night i am still feeling drowsy, neither here
	nor there - alone yet haunted by myself i suppose-
	a before q, heartfelt theft without love -
	the idle man dreams again, towels washed -
	i'm in apartment three k and i can't leave
	it dreams, home - a former friend sleeps
	over i instruct, shut the door feeling
	eyes at the entrance - the thing about
	the scene was not the acquaintance or
	the eyes but going to the closet that
	was on the right side of the hallway
	pick pulling out satin pink blanket -
	thinking it over it is like a shock -
	no dream ever felt as real at least not
	recently - other scenes infected with foreign
	agents, vendor scribe deprived of rem -
	still the silver handle circle pulled with the
	door folding into its v-shape stance -
	everything there save for the green towel-
	i thought upon waking i didn't see the 
	green towel well that is how real it
	reeled, sealed now in distraction of
	start of day hesitation, where i should
	clarify some points but i won't -

      saturday night is all right for cooking and cleaning,
	well as i sat lamenting the cheap vinegar
	instead of heinz with the lettuce i thought
	this might be good, there won't be aything
	in the way if want to start recording -
	part of egypt melted as ganna wore a tight
	red dress for the first time, maddie went
	to dublin and turned it into a dozen stories -
	i truly enjoyed all of them - counting my
	clothes and dividing to conquer my leather,
	i felt happy that paris fashion week was 
	coming to an end, not that i don't love lara
	- it is only that after the 22nd i won't
	feel any obligation or worry in terms of
	that frenzy - not that i had to concern myself
	with it but how does one deny one's own nature -
	i tried hiding my love for emilee, for example,
	only to meet the quote 'love grants in a moment...'
	alexandra's iced coffee in winter, i suppose if
	you are that hot...heavy on the right shoulder
	i got up at three in the afternoon, two eastern
	standard time, six or so london, glasgow - 
	the unusal fact haunts me that i left lauren
	over a kneecap concert and as their criminal
	film emerged i tried to leave emilee -
	of course, i can't leave anyone...neither can 
	you unless you erase your memories...in dreams
	i try leaving a restaurant saloon, the unpaved 
	avenue of turn of century western america 1890s
	vest boots wooden structures outside looking in
	as an actor arrives who i can hear before seeing
	and don't actually look to gaze or stare, he is
	speaking of the saloon restaurant and they are 
	rolling out a greeting party...i get up from 
	the ground, i get up from the dream weighing my
	mixed emotions over once upon a time in the west
	or was it hollywood, the one that smashed bruce
	lee and turned the charlie manson story into
	a joke - i had listened to the charade soundtrack,
	isn't that where the theme from il padrino got
	produced but you can hear too how mancini listened
	to the classics and learned, then diary of a madman
	to spy on rhoads riffing but i didn't feel the 
	hype over sato was deserved - but maybe the only
	hype that is right is macbeth - in thoughts a few
	of the lines arrive before i hear them and it makes
	me feel not as dumb as i think - i put place the
	old lyric book with the magical cities listed on 
	the back, one of the songs now makes me think of
	robyn and lara instead of suze, shoes and the blues
	i'm still baffled that the loose pages i had insterted
	somehow got left out - only a couple of lyrics but
	what if they were the one...the needs of the many,
	vulcan mother in that hallway is perhaps my favorite
	memory from home, imaginary yet fleshed out in
	living scenes seen...i seen true detective, she
	hates the beatles...but all i could think was
	you went to iceland! chapter two is tonight i think,
	already in the valued file.

	23 jan - oh i see haute cotoure torture follows week - hot co-tour
	of vice president silence - death party follows in the press, 
	i hope mary weiss knew i liked her shangrila song a lot -
	so out koo true - that word reminds me of how dalva said
	auf read it oh meaning me - i suppose i should restart these
	notes as the series has gone book length - where was i ah yes
	chapter two - bodies on the ice rink - what the dead want -
	i'm so enchanted that i get up that next day not knowing
	if i was dreaming about jodie foster or holding an imaginary
	conversation with her - i think will do that february -
	i went shopping and shot the day waiting for a delivery -
	exhausted it was then i realized lara was only getting 
	started - leave it to men to miss the point, lack patience,
	and go deaf at the wrong time - a bill of divorcement,
	maureen as the ultimate daddy's girl - but wait that
	frenzy is it also mine - for a minute i worry but not
	really - too cool for school - i go back to the original
	wherein katherine is truly stunning to behold - so much
	so it makes me think of elizabeth taylor and i find the
	note she sent me put placing in the list - it feels weird
	as a writer to admit seeing her had a greater impact on
	me than seeing ginsberg - just one of those things - you
	know the eyes have it - i wanted buffalo to have it but
	obviously the league wants swiftie publicity and so 
	wide right people talk scripted but come on you fake the
	field goal and go for the touch down hell or highwater -
	at least fans still have college play where the effort
	is often palpable dude they were all like see you later
	great game even as an entire town felt suicidal - michelle
	young i can't look - yes i still don't watch and the tv
	is yet unplugged - just happened to keep a peek at the reels-
	seeking club zero like we are pals, i tell mia it was the
	movie of the year in a rant against oscar barbie for the
	hype - at least nyad got some and hopefully el conde and
	the teacher's lounge will turn out winners - two turkey
	sandwiches and i turn in for a nap around noon after
	installing yet another batch of the bitch is back vst
	plug ins - darfur laughs at the other wars with a few
	more blood bath days they won't be able to reach our
	body count - no i haven't seen all the films, nobody
	can and i should hold my two cents until getting
	familiar with the portable door and especially no more
	bets which sounds not only excellent but timely -
	estelle talked, zofia prayed, i noticed the asian
	earthquake after the landslide but i was too self
	centered to investigate but of course i hope the
	land is settled. set tuesday still early as i try to
	conclude this paragraph note ego-porn i hear emilee
	claiming centered as part of her word stack and then
	lara calling for the finish line as i think two more
	days at hat cute our devotion blinking even in two
	degree weather...obviously if had directed wasikowska
	the ending song of club zero would have been that
	nickelback 'We'll all stay skinny, 'cause we just won't eat'
	rockstar tune but let us not speak of that or saltburn
	zero nominations! with the most haunting song ever!

   i get up to usual smoke nicotine, java
cup caffeine.  dream said girl trying
to show me her body. like a dressing
room. i try to explain the blur...
how in my imagination it is the face.
partly by choice yet also by the
mailer fact of being aware of 
one's self after writing 
anything even remotely
worth the while...
how easy it is to become
a puppet for spies...
dylan said he saw his loved
ones turning into puppets...
i tune into past slow train
finding an infidels out take
and record it twice -
neither good yet great in
not having practiced or evev
heard it since years a go go...</p>
				<p>visions watching that film -
one of the houses reminds
me so keenly of a recent

examining q-tips, she is wearing
a tee that reads most valuable

for a chinese woman...
i say a few words in my choppy
chinese and wave goodbye -
i think about them both

emilee wore a turtle neck
in california and the series

i was thrilled to see her and
and the film was pretty thought
provoking...it's one that i 
suspect a lot of people will watch
twice...in a power of the dog trance
i waltz around the early afternoon,
i've got rawhide phil, fill a thought
with that dog obit kabuso,

and i tell her well i've never
felt a man so near - when i turn
for a glance i instead awoke -
it may have been lighthearted,
but i think both were illusions,
perhaps even clones - mixing
in to match some memory but
the scenery was nowhere right -
masked foes possibly to join...
i jump back into dreams, 
apartment three k, i am thinking
about how good it feels to be me -
last room down the hall
standing at the door instantly
thinking why am i here...
i hear emilee's voice and 
wiggle out of bed -
don't you have a croissant to 
eat or something...croissant
clutch i suppose her crimson
coach purse is...
demi, the two skinny girls
grateful dead cover starts
in my mind's stereo as i 
turn on the motorola -
music as i picture her...
suddenly recall the 
can't wait video poolside-
pretty bright, yellow top light -
a woman does anything
then the commentizement rings -
i'm too in love to think clearly-
nose colored glasses, lynyrd
that smell - i brew more and
grew ashes - can wait fan
ate air - i suspect soon
i will escape this imposed
simple style that feels so
blatantly intent against

(money to bring
his wife and was working 
hard  to make enough washing 
and see if that will
their house) that is this poem...

He arose as dreams vanished. There was 
eros from the baby munchkin cake and
it made for a bit of conflict. No cornflakes,
pasta with 'a reckless moment'...
some "thoughts" were missing
and he downloaded them to play...
and right off the bat he wanted to say;
The purpose of his writing style
was to make new connections, indeed
to make it new. He knew he wanted
to make poetry for her,  yet the 
bullhead pants (wtap) obituary
beverly j boggs dowler wheaton
via philip hickman found him
watering the plants and so he 
settled in to wait upon wit a while.

The slacks were jeans he had
enslaved into the trash with a sensed
low class tracking system...
Now confirmed. 

This lacks the whip of sensation but
he considers nobody would believe
the dead sons appeared in the shut
sugar bowl after he did the dishes
and then mostly disappeared.

Like magic, no, like mayhem...
ahem. enough prelude.

He wrote as love envisioned.

i view 'pink string and sealing wax'

paying only attention to her

yet the trash needs to be put placed out

this bitch downstairs goes in and out pretending

a basement so she can come upstairs excaping

the comatose blubber she is paid to care for -

excapade on ice, menthol illegal most of the time

i write the haiku biscuit crumb before exhaling this

other bitches insisting she's an ugly little troll

not worth all my time much less all my love

i listen hoping she can't hear such hate

clean the back rooms, cook the meal

awaking to her post about the ancients

eating all the silphium - golly i gotta cook.

Lucy  has a solution for apathy

—an axe. 

So when she finds her poet

 intent on skipping the tribeca, 

it's off with his film festival. 

Right from the back seat,

axing did she even follow...


Unfortunately, he witnesses 

the deed, the first season of 

pretty little liars...

 Lucy is tried and judged 

criminally stereotyped...

montgomery, he plays

She spends the next seven years 

at the break even rom com farm.

With Elvis to regain emotional stability.

 Upon her release, she nearly had him,

I've played Melanie, why not Emilee...


He even starts to like her tattoo collection. 

Then, life sentence and the podcast 

made him think, has she even read

Spengler... 

he goes steady with Emilee, 

the richest young girl in town....

Lucy attempts to get cast as a Bond 

girl, but settles for Kissinger in Paris -

troubled by dreams and flashbacks of her 

previous seven years as Aria

She envisions lying in bed with 

the severed heads of inky and emilee...


packing for Manhattan, she carefully organizes

the grenades...

The encounter proves too much and she
	  
she writes new curses on the back 
	  
of her cat on a hot tin roof poster

Let his penis wither, 
	  
let his bones crack, 
	  
let him see his legions drown in their own blood...

 Shortly after, inky cant help but write
	  
an interlude lime posset for her... 

Lucy fears he may have chopped up

the strait jacket story -

Carol screams, I want the truth

it's like an engram inside Cruise control. 

But Tom is blackmailed by Suri -

stop meddling with my right hand man... 

A short time later, mission impossible wraps.

What am I doing over here with the workers,
the gooks, the apes, the dogs, 
the errand boys,
the human animals?
Why don’t I come over with the board, 
and drink coca-cola or make it?

One evening, Inky tries to explain it all to Emilee.

It is not a happy affair. Little Red looked too much like Alivia!

In a rage, Lucy reminds everyone it's a party not a funeral -

Still the balcony had everyone thinking it was about money 

 not love,
	  
obviously, he only wants emilee for her finances!
	  
greed pursued by alone in his home 

he confronted L A WOMAN and COME ON LETS GO

with self comparisons - key of A...  

subsequently promising to help lucy work

with the luke warm coca cola...

a half step down from those chords -

	Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us...

doors locked some of them holding a knife -
	  
 In the film's ironic finale, the now magically not typecast

 Lucy prepares to make Emilee even richer...

chained to earth like the vampire dyke.
 
The synonyms don;t always work
in the newly found image;
she wears stars little and shiny,
across her collar,
it is not a wish of death, yet dying ain't we all.
 
Meanwhile, if you live it up you won't live it down,
other tom, i'm still in a wait, She went and took,
Contemporary that California trip
Against my colon and aromas. I get Jealous
Stagnant, even horny; I'm sure she wants to 
say I love you likewise or more...

yet even facing each other:
 
we will be bottled up,
Do you take this woman?  marriage when?
I took this woman three years ago
here an anniversary song, shaking from the lost,
Emilee exact date !
 
since curtain I am not staff - only an individual;
memory, validation for the shoe,
it was this time of the season...
i looked away not thinking not knowing
the truth, the love...
then the interruption, the delay,
how could there be anyone else...
air vanishing, i was dizzy...
 
not even recording for six months.
And all that day, becomes another day:
 
until evening falls and she calls,
cat quick my purr none of it matters 
shell or show only she mattress...
only she married...breathe
everything is fine but i can't use 
them pictures and i can't hear the name
 
which set such distractions;

even the other day, even today, tonight
it's all toxicesque, a jazz too fast to groove
making me wonder if madness
 
has been taking extra vitamins
but sanity needs her, needs that anniversary,
even the contrast and cost...
of it all since it proves a feeling,
like playing crosby i'm through with love
all afternoon weeping while she worked salon.

 
hennessy story my line about her smile,
was no allusion to work poster,
 
i'm not wearing any panties --
well we could, always adopt,
although the pregnant dream was so reel, real,
 
rael innocent even if guilty;
my virgin saint, 
 
i'm exhausted and i ate too much.
too bad it wasn't your pussy,
maybe a bit later, 
don't get me wrong, sex
 
not, with fears, cannibalism,

Although a bite or, mooning nibble upon bare hill
thrill still into a quev'ring
ah yes even to coin new word,
 
che guevara,
bolivia  blur stares at the new world order;

i take five tic tacs.

with a marlboro:
cigarette, ashes move before me,
 
the rainy night knows i am afraid.
The live wire pain sudden and vicious,
soul casino, even if i have placed no bet
well alien probes and satanic spirits trying 
on a talent like suspenders, spies
lift and leave, sometimes i think it's you,
insisting on something perhaps i cannot hear.
here...
Being more than they, 
hey, do you really love the smiths...
 
GE wandered into Chinatown bank.
sorry if i kissed like onion, 
i have a neverending need in red or white,
the fan whirls.
hoping to win the fender,
 
play you a love song,
that rises above the trite, something trippy.
traveling far away into tomorrow,
maybe even like this canto
3/4 cup sugar my dear anniversary sweetheart.

The girl in dream, I'm sitting here with grin, she was holding a diploma, 

two fans blazing, then put-placing art over it. rain yet tinted with hotness.

I'm sure i dreamt other things, five June listin news calls I say yeah but

still debating it within myself...twenty twenty five seems a long ways 

away, things like that time I went dream apartment hunting with 

Caitlin...No one is yet to explain Ibiza to me...weren't it Max, Erin

oh kneel, is that why the American in Russia saunters into mind?

in any case, reason eight why i can't remember my dreams lately...

pretty sure it was new Manhattan York city - maybe it was even

Emilee, all I think about...all i care about today, said Lucy - 

Elton's barrel full of monkeys(,, Johnny the bossman* )handing

out bananas, I hope she is fine in her jury chair - where was I,

oh yes, despite the fact that dang Adobe went no more draw

or photoshop mix, flashback Serif (does my art really hold such

power that actual corporations shit I mean shift away products...)

I was feeling all right, thinking of the old bag, affectionately marie

anne - wd'ave put you in seven but sometimes when the thought

bomb goes off i can't jugle it all - idea run at arm...maybe someday

not a transition but a song quote you'll see that it's true

there was no greater love than what i had for you...

now then there, i'm with the grin 'cause suri was racing

around the big apple...i;d mentioned here right before

and enjoyed the near synchronicity, hell, i even took

out the Clorox and mop all the way to the living room...

*(that's what waters muddy called winter not the season -)

i'm not certain sure why he's considered a great given

that not really lead player nor an operatic voice,

still hard again is genius in terms of blues -

bliss at the rest of Miss Grant takes Richmond,

I asked my friends about her, but all their lips were tight -

our lips are seal'd. meal again onion rice chicken...

there's something divine about it most likely from

keira posting posing next to emilee...angel necklace

slave ring metallic teal toes...sixteen glass panel

window painted sea green with an anchor sticker

venus symbol above a heart...lean out your window

goldenhair, no i still don't know how i hit that double

triplet sounding ring, don't even think it can be tabbed...

while dancing with the thought that she was actually

right here, i got so shy i'm sure i blushed, i even sort 

of hoped she hadn't read some of the words herein,

why did i let it get so beatnik naked in terms of 

emotion -  cut reaction line, bring out

Lazarus machine for juice zest and sugar...

the future bleeds through -

i didn't get to sleep til after three again,

even had to overcome a sudden migraine as if the

spirit of fifi had visited, she of headaches when 

sexless...awaking near noon to lower back pain

as if someone had tried to fold me into a suitcase...

but maybe it was only the kitchen...at ritual meditation

i felt all right - forty minutes, graduated digestion

chainsmoke -  i felt i could even sing you're not

alone.

this is what distracted me from leaving my humble abode -

he however wore hearted sleeves in his writing,,,

merry web

"Middle English oistre, borrowed from Anglo-French oistre, ostre, 
going back to Latin ostrea, ostreum "bivalve mollusk, oyster,"
 borrowed from Greek óstreion, óstreon, of uncertain origin..."

origin...well sure some "critics" want you to be original,
what is new under the sun gunnin at the shade,
go ahead leave your newborn without
learning or notes and it will only
be idiot...a tale told, then heard no more!

the source here is all that happens as it happens -

more or less...keeping in mind that definitons might evolve

He says, murder, he says, keep it up like this

We all know the Beach Boys couldn't

wait for June - Good Vibrations - 

I can see-feel the why reasons -

Six June seduced me and 

kept me up nearly into dawn -

no relation to the dish washing soap -

Of course, it wasn't the late night,

wasn't the day or date...A not so

simple twist of fate -

Reaching through air, through

space and time to make 

rhymes with her in rhythm's 

rhythm. A rhythm which swayed

into dreams. Dreams...Therein

ourselves asleep dreaming 

a nap, perhaps a sofa, maybe

it was my sofa bed -  retired

from living room and now

serving martin acoustic

and Ibanez electric...

sceptic glances - she is 

undressing yet not nude -

i am drooling in my mind

hopefully not rude - 

deep into her eyes, she is 

looking back at me -

the ronettes shld've been

singing be my baby -

turn my head

secret glances

her sister above my skull

i can't hear her words

septum ring smiles

i was wondering why

she seems fearless of the sun -

emilee has two sisters

these are my sisters...

crumbles the question

we have no dildos

possibly then i explain

it's literature too and 

dramatic effect...

et cetera in terms of 

big pink stun gun

not a recommendation 

something shoots emilee

a bit in the distance perhaps 

to dance - prancing in another

girl moves the blanket covering 

my bones, i look down at her,

at my boner - i don't want to make

the connection, the number you 

have reached is no longer in service,

please check the number and dial again -

i get up and it's only ten in the morning -

more in love than i had been even if

interrupted - i'll buy no dick, albino

winter that stranger sure sounded 

alike the dark side of the moon

track same year - i decide suddenly

during the ritual to set up for 

a new recording - lucky town -

i put it together, key of E

but when I strum along it is 

in F - well, maybe C...

i record two vocals quickly

escaping the deliveries 

i stacked on purpose all during

the calls to cancel my subscription

listin ounce don't throw

and tell the phone company why

i haven't paid the bill, so it all 

dissolves into a density they can't

crawl through as i lettuce myself

lime olive oil turkey sandwich

The record was released nearly immediately...

I wrote that song a few years ago, c major,

f major, g major...I always credit James

Caan as co-writer, but I don't want to explain it -

when i jotted down the notes for actually

recording it - it was f sharp minor,  E major,

C major, A major, Asus2...

but, as it turned out more like f /b flat/ g/ c...

done quickly on a headphone mix which

when heard on laptop speakers made me sick

as the drums held a sort of ten k frequency slpash

- a rinky dinky sound that took a couple of hours

to manage... at that point i couldn't hear what

i was doing...i decided to spectral pan the 

beat and hoped that my instinct (on headphone)

had been right concerning the rest of it - 

of course, being me, right after ritual "meditation"

i went in for a second take, this time in the key of A,

asus, bsus2, e major 6 (i think) which then breaks

into f#m & e but with a flip back note since i liked

the sound - again two vocals but this time used parts

of either take since i did not pronounce sweet as you 

in the first take - i had intended to imitate the 

Andrew Sisters' bugle boy 

you know that growl...

but when i got to it, my main 

concern was simply escaping into myself and this time

the only glitch was guitar volume, but that didn;t take 

so long to settle - yes i listened to the first (released)

version against this new one and even i don't know which

one works better...i called the second one lucky town 9,

estimating the number of rendered tracks since the first -

obviously lime posset ten is only keeping the title

and format, but not going for the intricate poetics...

as they say, just saying or even js

nothing to do with javascript -

in the wee hours i envision fbi agents attempting

to capture...me? well, maybe it was only a movie

memory...

in sleep, i dream of several people on the floor,

pale, seemingly horny...some are masturbating -

two men and several women, perhaps one couple

is having intercourse ---  i don't feel surprised

or even curious, i look at one woman and watch 

her also take to the floor, alone...i think, to touch

herself...there's something of a blur, no distinct

faces or features...i awake and think nothing of

it except until the following evening, a few hours

ago when i felt the scene re-live like an echo

in peripheral imagination myself not excited

only confounded - i sleep again not getting

out of bed and find myself baffled by someone

from the supermarket giving a speech about

the virgin mary - i don't care if it rains or 

freezes as long as i got my plastic jesus -

dashboard of the dream, i noonish get up

almost running from the scene - there's no 

trust there and it wasn't even in my language -

i shampoo my hair with a sudden back pain -

street legal set up to take out the trash - 

imaginary

crash into me both hips pain so severe i sit me down -

breathe and wonder who or what - 

when then order kfc, mostly to facilitate recording

so as to not worry about fixing a meal or dishes - 

1940 a film called he married his wife...

it's entertaining enough and of course the thought

of wife or married makes me think of emilee, although

constantly in my thoughts...

yes - i first met suri cruise in LaGuardia

when i lived in blue white bathroom with skankbang girls -

she's on her way to Carnegie Mellon

we wish her all possible success in Pittsburgh

but i notice as i ramble through my thinking into words

that i haven't mentioned emilee too much here -

maybe i am trying to give nine the chance to firm itself

to film its motion picture production in its selected

locations - the powers that be seemed to pick up

and plug into California...myself i cannot say

what the side effects will be, i can say it was 

not my target...volusia
		    
the sheriff called it pretty shocking -

as holly hills took over chief and captain resigned...

mailer told me if you kill a cop in the states 

point blank you are punk -

he didn't mean that in a rocking way -

i certainly don't mean or aim to be a punk - 

but as i pulled the proverbial ring from grenade

vest poem my mind whispered, for Mathilda...

lando, land ho - 

singing songs of shady sisters
and old time liberty
songs of love and songs of death
and songs that set men free

in any case, it may be that i was overwhelmed 

by something she said "a metaphor"

(i want my hair to go up in flames
for the one i love 
to paradoxically be ignited and extinguished
only by their touch
to burn and burn
and have them catch fire beneath me)

"lust and longing" she may be late

for i long ago fell into the burning  fire

down down down as in the song the flames 

went higher...yet what a nearly perfect poem.

perhaps writing here today not wanting

to throw my hat in the ring -

yes let that be the verse of the day tonight.

trying to not football myself into dreams -

do you hear voices, i'll pay you back -

don't we all - no idea who might be talking -

everybody's talking, way past midnight

cowboys, i'm walking here -

wonder if i'm being too aggressive

in my own fan tah sea -

swimming into dreams with the 

day starting, i find myself dreaming

of keira, she had been on my mind

yet i wasn't sure why as i wasn't certain

about the dreams - vague conversations,

alike sitting around speaking without

trying for a keeping...in the mid morning,

i awake to the sound of a foreign

tongue, is it a las tres, or is it ala trez

third tine of an antler's beam

perhaps allah tress, akbar - but allah

is also a woman's name in the cyrilic -

i cycle through these thoughts feeling

still keira and missing emilee -

still, i don't want to crowd her - 

then and there or here now where

readers might decode it as repetition - 

i can't help it, as she says it

how you feel is how you feel about it,

paraphrase...yes i could be fiction,

make something up to entertain

but why should i? do i have to prove

anything - no. i daydream, i have a

all of it together is overwhelming -

smoke, to smoke more that is what i 

need, but not these, no cough cough -

i carve out a plan -  i call a taxi

to the store still in fear of the previous

experiences while sauntering - 

virgin olive oil, rice, friskies, and

a hundred and twenty cigarettes

no make that a hundred and sixty -

women in tight white dresses glide

by on their way to atm -

i decide to tip the cashier that

said hey instead of the sour faced

one that has merged with the register

and has become more machine than human -

back home, in minutes, but some ghostly

hamstring hounds my left leg, i sit in the

baby jesus tub letting the heat and pain

disperse...who is the disaster, your guess

 well goodbye Mama goodbye 
 ladies and gentlemen he's remounting 

yes he's he's up again 
 Restless as the horses 
 I pronounce a swivel neck 


 I pronounce claim that you two 
are here by neck and neck 
 they're turning into the stretch 

gone to the whip it's going
 wild come on come on 
almost a picture finished picture

Nuseirat, words i didn't know -
i didn't dream perhaps for thinking
ahem overthinking - 
to be perfectly clear, i don't
want to be with anyone else -
when i speak of Keira

about Emilee...or trying 
to get to her, in a sense,
to understand in another -
she's looking at another "artist"
i spend the afternoon eating
an onion feeling put aside -

not use rohypnol on the

to stop ww3, uhm world war three

I see the word count nearing fifteen hundred -

as nine skips ten into eleven,

free hornet eq plug in i think i miss

but then the email arrives with receipt -

in my dream, ironic humour, being only

a scene wherein i seen a picture of emilee

with a flashing triangle on the lower left corner-

earlier someone showing me a basketball

saying it is inspired by an orange -

meanwhile in the fridge

paramount rotting, i notice later...

i get up already late in the afternoon -

the room humid, my skin icky...

and my emotions getting a talking to...

look dear feelings, you love her obviously

but don't stress worry over a sensation

that is beyond your control - could be

foes doing those double speak lies -

could be they may even be trying to 

get her to see you as her enemy -

worst case scenario jealousy

marry me too or i will cc rider

dreams fading under the  tragedy

elvis concert starts...

i take up the job to remake the 

wordstar index html using

sea harvest, newsy css, and video -

it had been for a new artistic idea

page, but i liked it too much

details going into nearly nine 

in the evening - i make pasta

watch obsession otherwise

known as the hidden room - 

the puppy reminds me of bijoux -

so at this point too much for a short 

story, about a novella, but in 

continuation, a novel if edited...

I've used the word love sixty two 

times, it seems both too much

and not enough.

write something - yes, write something -

i turn to face my dreams, but there's a

taking my mind into curves i cannot turn...

thirteen June an hour after

going to sleep i dream of 

hearing some disturbance

beyond my room...

there's money in there -

the words slow and viciously

excited ring in my ear -

a crowd in living room

someone tells me that

other people had broken in -

i look at the yet how door

not even thinking of the locks

on the adjacent gate -

it is twisted, carved in at 

the bolt mechanism -

a woman approaches

I know you

I say from an office

job I never had -

realizing I am not fully

dressed i go to my clothing

room for ready to wear 

but there is a man there

moving things around

- the cat is there as well-

nobody can touch these

things, i have a very precise

system - he pulls out a cd

and puts it into a player

that i do not have -

I say that stereo

has no speakers -

no hay banda, yet a sort 

of jazz blazes through

I look at a statue that

I also do not have - 

it's faith and she's kissing

some boy, in front of them

another statue and it's 

tilly and she's saying I've

never done this, also 

becoming intimate -

someone darts out

from beside me

it's my cousin,

reportedly homosexual

but I've not seen proof -

he grabs and pulls my

wrist, i wriggle away -

writing now recall smacking

him with a belt -

well, we were kids,

imagine giving up a medical

career to suck dick or

take it up the ass -

surely it would kill Adolfo

his father one of my uncles

retro alpha male military 

personality never served

still freeloading on salute

alone, i suppose -

i'm still a kid, how did 

life get so serious -
 
i walk the few steps

of the inner hallway

back to main living room

where they are replacing

furniture, it looks nice

but what does it all mean...

as i ponder the question,

i get up half thankful that

it was a dream and half 

wondering what emilee

might be doing - i suspect

she's with Alivia or perhaps

worried over her little sister -

prayed to the lord for 

a loving mother or blonde

hair...has the latter,,,

letter someone urging me

to write this all down - 

and i agree but I've had this

sort of scene before except

without faith or tilly -

and certainly without

daydreaming that emilee

is giving me head - 

you married a whore!

a dirty little whore!

diseased whore!

whoa, for all i know she

is a virgin - 

people will talk, libel

slander et cetera - 

me i'm happy

that usually the

writing occupation

ain't sexualized...

one simply sits

there type tap type tap

nothing sexy about it -

unlike say music

or painting which 

indeed might be pretty sensual...

that ten men were at her door,

she said, send one away

theWHITEcat

(an unedited novel, wroted 2021 ©️ 2023)

   by inkrealm -www.inkrealm.info

i first met the white cat in passing, that is, it was passing along the sidewalk there at throwing distance from my apartment's front porch or main bedroom windows...

i could sense a vague conversation yet told the feline to hold on a second while i picked up a treat from the ice box. 

upon my return, i found it had waited...so much wiser than the kittens, they were new and hardly stopped to listen...

yesterday or the day before, i encountered it as i ventured out to dispose of trash...we greeted each other both perhaps apprehensive and i thought similar thoughts as on the occasion in which the waiting was resolved...

returning with a wild catch tuna can, it seemed anxious yet too polite to near...

i gave it some and left the rest at the the cat's discretion...

the devoured contents explained to me that it had been a goodly meal...that is, when i sauntered thataway for cigarettes...

having purchased the smokes, i was terribly surprised to find the cat so grateful that it greeted my arrival with quick happy gestures...

i grinned at the entrance and wished it well...

in my dream the russian girl removed my glasses at the library where we sat...it was the first dream i could recall in some many days...

this despite the fact of being as they say clean and sober...

2.

pull, the word wrote itself as i plugged in the keyboard to write at the drizzle of dawn...

i had dreamt pretty clearly of jasmin in conversation, near enough to study her lips...i remember asking about fashion and i remember a sort of surreal transition of her within a frying pan...

of course i awoke to wonder, the likel;y conclusion of an imposter seemed reasonable....just like the russian girl either alina or zlata as in fact the have very similar faces yet in either case an element of control hovered over the sensations as if someone pretended to be someone else...

more so with alina than zlata, to be vaguely clear....

i went back to sleep, soundly and secure and in the knowledge that i had imagined writing a short story...when he squeezed the crazy glue tube it squirted along his right eyelid which mnade him scramble for all sorts of things before realizing there was no time and with his remainging peeper he placed a call for help...

there are two versions, the other is an intentional pouringo f glue over a sleeper...

now then, the pull, as it were is misplaced, that is to say i have already written more perhaps than i could ever edit especially after the last novel...

what is this, then? a fair and good qustion yet one that will only reveal an answer as it will...

in dreams, it was maria that came to me yet neither maria aria nor maria neverova...as if to prove that the hours are only what we make of them, it was maria baez...

not that i mind, still, it is unusual and i suspect it stems from the same source well let us call it manipulation.

3. 

Yes obviously not pill pulled from thin air, but some sort of hovered touch spelled it as if magically or invisibly...

pulling at my dream, i find myself in a low lit bar the longer lonely types one might find in expensive hotels, there is a woman there and while i am standing as asexual as a tree she performs oral sex upon me yet my thoughts are about adjusting some parts of my body as if highly aware or distracted by possible onlookers...

Sunday had been the longest hours of any day that i had ever lived...i attempted several distractions without any luck or resolution finally judged myself heartbroken at the perhaps unfinished task of art pieces i had been in the process of creating...

of course i had completed well over six hundred prints but there was a novel which i longed to continue yet the muse took me in other directions  until even the unconditional love diminished itself to well let us see what happens next...

nothing happens, she gets thrown backwards onto a bed for kicks and mentions snow white...

pig intestines are thrown in the parliament...

people pretend to enjoy a puzzle as a movie but this only used to work with lynch in those dreamy scenes...

invented - inverted - i liked industry...

except at episode eight - the end - i had convinced myself somehow that another episode followed and was left a touch dazed...

where was i yes the muse well doubly dazed...amazed wherein once it was in awe now as confusion...

4.

the chaos races through my dreams, a blur of dread and desire...

i stand on a road of semi roasted pigs, all of them similar faced nearly alike the dying woman downstairs...

i am too far in to head back and cannot see the end of the road...

despair awakes me, another dream twice shot by spic cops in tge abdomen...

the worry that is recurring...

dreaming or awake, the muse returns to me...over and over as if in possession of my imagination...

down the street from columbia dorms across from barnard, in the unintentional app of the nap a group of people in a car parked i stand in gestures as she nears i am aware of being watched from an adjacent distance still i carry on as if only she existed until crashing down gently at her half embrace upon the pavement her hand pressing at the area between pocket and zipper...her kiss like some sort of lightning that awakes me...

i get up, the memory of the recent black cat left outside as if not visible to the nearby cvs guard on the asphalt trampled again and again by passing cars after dawns eerie light...

who could stand there supposedly to protect and disregard a dead kitten...

it rained, that night, and it was still raining when the white cat strolled by and i caught a glimpse, racing to give it turkey yet it was already wet and wanted the shelter of at least some makeshift umbrella...or perhaps itself upset over that loss...

each cat is unique in personality and conversation....although like God some do not speak...

we will catch each other anothet time perhaps when i figure out what this book is about...

so yes prelude or introduction...

5.

The whole day at work, Roy, with his wrinkled clothes and greasy hair, could only think of getting home, getting home and into bed.

into bed, not for dreams, but to masturbate.

6. 

While Roy might be a way to start, I argue with myself...Why fiction...for some profit...for to follow rules...dead black bears in the Jersey woods...hunting seasonings...no, I will not fiction here...slowly, with ten new euros, i will write as i feel it should be done...what key is that song in? key of me...

cat across the street i glimpse glance right after muse posted kittens...a slice of turkey and another then one more...

my panties match my dress said the thin tall vixen at the milk aisle...parmalat...yesterday was a water heater action packed fiction on itself up the stairs down the stairs...

melrose boulevard to amsterdam avenue...

how to open coconut in notnutnovember..

i do not actually know what roy does, i do know the president elect is making promises...

i thought of the muse  (as pretend editors offer the word latinx instead of spic but they are both gender nuetral...as if there might be more than two...) as do girls attempted temptation..

(the thought arrives from transgender news...but if you cannot see the first world aspect of it you will miss my point...nobody in the worldwide struggle to survive, alike the animal jungle kingdom, has got the time or inclination to question their identity, they are hungry and they are coming for us, usa)

pundi x and the uneven evil token coins taken as i stand still collecting for the girls i love and their future daughters...

as the earthquake hits chechnya and fiji, i start with dash...

oh the excitement by candlelit mining only to find it was not digital cash but the now untracked listing dashcoin...

or the quick gains while re watching ladybird...

evil web lies, of course you would perhaps call it greed if you doa didnt know me...

hmm shout out to a warning voice yet i only started hearing when they actually went into venezuela like a bribe bait offer of solution or should that be salvation...either or, it should not be done...

sure i suspected upon the uneven and strange desktop wallet which basically forces you to go with the mobile but those scenes preying upon the desperate, yeah exactly...

heave ho i am actually glad af they refused to give me a master node...

the only loss other than time was that two dollar paid to always in development quoinpro app for same coin...said coin, sad coin...

privacy sell out for placement...

evolution of the currencies takes time or bloodshed...

as i pondered the weirdness, i dreamt an empty six pack of whiskey which turned into a colorful closet and a dead man at the door...

like tits in disney movie, pundi x was really exciting and seemingly generous until it wasnt.

from day one i tried without success for verification then after a year or was it two the mechanism shut down for failure to kyc...oh there was a few months prior of loss of daily claim reward which they slowly fixed then promised to return eventually...but i aint the only one burned by the scheme as i found replica after repliclant in play store talk...

cannot log in due to kyc and cant kyc due to an update that logged everybody out....

now how to skip the countless online cloud miners that have vanished into an air so thin one gets papercuts out of the blue and simply ask why on earth would folks fix it so? 

all the way back direct to xapo faucets...

the dying breed the wallet itself turning into self proclaimed bank...

perhaps from transactions they pocketed to cover the cost of transaction...

ps, fees can change at their whim as i was told when it happened to me as i moved it all to coinbase only to be kept waiting at the miss out end of the earn program except for one coin...

so yeah left nothing but ukraine cents at xapo and little as possible at coinbase both owned by themselves now....

the most bizarre story in this journey which contrary to this thread has seen some profit, 

well wait there are two, eobot, after months of building it up my miner dropped that version leaving me with the lesser degree drip down and no faucet...

for historians there was an eobot v2 which faked it for reasons yet unexplained...

so much data swirling in head i actually forgot the second part of this paragraph twice, oh yeah nice hash...had it all working wide awake on bitcoin groove for a week maybe more when suddenly down came the possible fake news of missing funds et cetera site shut down app updated to something that would not work on my os when the dust settled...

these are the lyrics to its a long way to the top if you wanna rock and roll...

an eerily similar situation arose with safex...they switched mining methods as i was about to cash in and suddenly the end...

coinomi you notice does not delist itself...

in conclusion, avoid password managers specifically avira...i had used it years and then whem finally blockchain gave me some stellar part of which is now in limbo from transfer to astral wallet hello we must be going well i set the ps unworried then avira upgraded my account only to delete all the saved log ins when the upgrade trial period expired, but at least it proves why we dont need fiction at this point...stranger than yes no we caint do nothing im terms of a reset even if all your other info is in place, kick scream, seed phrase hell...

cat not seen in several days...yesterday a grey cat that reminded me of shimmer crawled by with a wanting singsong yet i could not write with a mind filled with spicorama bla bla bla...

later one of the dark cat kittens loitered and ran off crazy legged when i deposited a slice of turkey...the slice itself blanketed his stride and split in the middle of the road i watched while he had the half grub in corner shadows then rambled back searching for more to devour the left behind portion in gulps undet my  window as the grey cat eased in and they greeted each other without hesitation...

but last night the white cat called on me nearly by name and i rushed out with steak and she raced up to me positively without hesitation then as if realizing her impulsive move bit and ran back to a more distant protocol returning after my exit for the rest of the meal her tail curved in a grin...

three verge, some ripple and tezos, same amount as stratis or more in tron, heightening gains in monero, zcash, bitcoin cash, nano, zcore, zen, doge, runebase and some few others at the exchange along with a couple of airdrops on the way...

possibly or most likely a productive moment not to mention the bitcoin to be counted...

i can sense the biographer pen, he always did tend towards a coin collection and this seemed to fuel his interest in new currencies...

but back to the nitty gritty, deviant individualism will be met with social media shadow banning...

hell, i didnt even type up my conspiracy thesis...

baffling...

i throw out the remains of the mirror i had perhaps thought to convert...

the white cat is waiting, half way through the door as i approach...

she loves me yet still retains her majestic composure, distance...

three slices of turkey...

somehow i scratched my arm, thought of the devils nickname...

dawn dream on top of a sensual woman as if in a relationship if intimacy...

there is a sliding tinted window...i am inside her yet working on closing the contraption as people are visibly stepping through the other side as it shuts i feel her sexual pleasure and get up from the dream with a weird sense of accomplishment and perhaps the need to find her for she felt as no other dream had...

the lyrics...got that lust in front of her its right behind...resound in my thoughts...

i think it might be an actress yet the muse also comes to mind along with that evil door dream...

not of the song but of recent art...

it is early and i return to dreams...sonya by now back in pinsk...minsk looked desolate and cold...happy for her return...

i am sold on an idea to hold these currencies and possibly proven right at least today as a few prices soared...

before i know it it is neay four days but finally the stratis coin of famed seven cents arrived, i play blondie and go gos and go for more...

meanwhile staking...

i try out telling the story to see how it will sound,,,

sounds of sunday visit, haunting, distracting, i do not get it as certain as you do not get the part of this earlier chapter exhaling hatred...well, i do not want to explore beyond the point but there should be some subtance for justificatiion...obviously everyone is going to die, expire...eventually and so the meaning is intended in the immediate not the next in line as it were...and well when you hound someone for no reason then this sort of amoral bloodlust arises even without propaganda...

properly gaind some other coins other getting nearer...

postponed it seemed in dreams for another argument of mortgage and me well no wonder there are so few bridal shower pictures...

for the record, i nearly firmly believe some of these marriages near to me are are pure sham yes the flim flam of a fancy betrayal but intended to what? 

i do not know - i do no know that there is something off, way off unless it is only stupidity but of course i am not that smart...

art of ghetto dream sort of a squat style concrete settlement joe says he lives there doorman of distant relations...i feel trapped or about to be and suddenly find myself looking through items that belong to doris...

i get up to no girl but coins again and more girls than i need in my want even if it always the muse that seems to be next to my imagination...

dreams then very specific structures yet nothing attractive, sort of spartan spaces some of them narrow and i seem to be hiding with someone else maybe it is her i cannot say but a dark man saunters in front me naked then at the turn of stairs another man this one lighter draws blood from my right arm -

there is talk like a small yell of the creation of a monster and i awake...

anyway, the phone was on and atop the bed but arising i found it off and on the floor...

fear of sleep walking....hmm...

worse, possession...

you know neither of those girl groups would have made it today not with the beauty standards raised so high and despite the fact that they are beautiful in their own right...

in my own light...

now i have done a lot, gone the distance as it were or even werewolf of london in a series of dreams but i have not finished harlots ghost,,,,

it's just that it feels that it is a crucial time for some of these currencies and getting into position will maybe ease a lot more time for reading down the line...

line the down, way back somewhere herein i had mentioned some scattered and even divided thoughts on subjects political and i wanted to or want to also put place a sort of book end (oh my how the blankenstein suddenly disappears) ahem harrumph whatever, lookit a lot of people i admire do not hide the fact that they are all for the return of democrats even a fractured footed groper that is when not in bernie camp site socialism sanders not madoff...which is to say i might be wearing my doubt a bit too tightly...but still, without actually going back and reading within these pages, i feel curiously satisfied in what i have stated...now in the shadows i feel the chase of the laughingstock gag but i am not afraid of such antics i went to high school in the states - if someone can take such effort to try and underline a threat well then it only proves me well not me but my writing right.

right in, ride in on a two thousand dollar check everybody thinks they are already going to get except me and sveta...

still, in general or overall i do think despite the foolishness that the invisible government is trying to keep it all from chaos...

to maintain order...not that i am going to go along with it but i can sort of see a workable theory within that context...

yeah yeah i know it's too much it;s as troublesome as aliens to religion....

not my fault. i am here on business, my own business and as many girls as i can save via literature poetry art and the variations of those seven notes we call music...

had you asked me i would have told you what i thought even before reddit youtube -

now i am not free or far enough away from sunday visit to have it as i want it but by jings i am getting there.

junky echo joke, i smell oil like from a deep fry contraption that should be changed and blurt out that i have been transposed to kfc where i had recently called for an order...hours and a day pass until that sniff of underarm...it's you bill you are the odor...

going to soap up now since the SV insisted on crowding into the shower room for a meeting discussion thus making it a memory of them instead of a simple water closet. 

hopefully i will find some way to reverse that unpleasant scene.

i find myself in oops possession of more  data than should be legal...

sorry im not sorry, i set myself not to learn but to earn...

i cannot however brag at the gains within that time period but there is a much wanted portion of cloak i now own and periodically my determination was proven more than timely, indeed nearly clairvoyant.

some coins rose as if claiming their rightful place of worth...

it was historic and it is not over.

however, without writing i am not truly myself.

a word now is needed i feel in terms of that hateful sentiment which to some might seem immature or vengeful...

i swear it is  neither although revenge is not without merit...

ahem hiroshima nagasaki, well, language is that virus...

how to put place it, they were rude and unkind and i was wronged and without reason which led to the trauma still spilling out upon these pages -

seeing them the other day i was panic stricken incapable of telling what i had upon my person and turned back for a lighter all ready in my pocket...

it had been a year since i saw faviola who wore a white pearl bracelet on her left wrist...

spending the night together we hardly spoke and the spook of the intrusive patrol was swept away in the near nearness of her...

perhaps that says something more than i can in wishing them exterminated, these hours given to us  cannot afford such weight upon their shoulders...

all the shouting amounts to an equal silence in the grave...

well until we find a screaming ghost...

host of another day another dream_ 

toast with the old bag, she is beautiful and we are speaking like a water cooler couple sitting down office style until some other man settles down next to us and i race away into a red and white room but she is racing behind me, speaks so directly to mother that mother disappears then she mounts me muses away my hair from my face saying you're not bad and i try to hide my smile but she kisses me as i graze her hip with my right hand awaking...

there is snow in long island shultz has just died...kansas city threw away the superbowl literally...miley was in concert...

i had done three versions of sweet sixteen before anyone could say too much and i did them in the usual style that is as improvisations even my fingers hurt as i had not practiced played in months...

vasilisa, naya, maria...never had i been so in the moment at birthday celebrations...

idea run at arm, the second one excluded,

gee i had wanted to wroted her every august twenty first...

in any case, aside from the bit of cloak, i made gains in zcore zen and zcash, some of the zec still pending in payout...

let me back track, at the start of my journey coinbase refused to pay me twenty five cents in  bitcoin cash and it made me anxious enough to attempt paying for some coins,

i invested reluctantly in fan tokens and my hesitation turned to worry when four euros became three and nearly two...

i also invested in mycointainer but later found they required ten or a hundred times more in order to withdraw and pleaded to get pulled out which happen3d or is happening with most of my deposits but neither the rapids they so eagerly give at entrance nor any other currencies gained while staking as well as the nine dollar subscription fee -

luckily offset by ten plus dollars in cloud mining...

why obviously the tide was turning...

still in the investment department, it was looking gloomy and to add to a sense of doom a gemini purchase of kyber dragged on until i gave up...

presently, the saved coins are doing all right some of them even earning interest, knc albeit a lesser amount was purchased from tezos holdings...

ah yeah, the fan tokens looks set to climb...

my worry as when an etc transaction went obliterated eased while confidence flourished...

to be perfectly clear, mostly i am speaking in cents, pennies from heaven, claimed through so called faucet work...rip moon bit bonus fun coinpot buried february now...

yet the sense is as follows, my eighty or so verge is now above a dollar as is my little binance assortment...

and the reasoning is to leave some "thing" to those girls i consider as near to me as closeness allows...

by that time these portfolios might well balance their wishes as they fortify my testament...

writing down the word seeds, i think of how it will go down...

if you have never set down thirty twelve and twenty four sets of words for nmemonic discovery then you cannot understand my paternal emotion in glee to think this or that might give these women financial freedom or even further away for their own daughters...

once in a while, as i look at the number 36677 as the number of claims at one place, i feel lucky in a foolish way...who knew i had holdings in btcpop that had grown over time and walking in already found gain...

a gain that reinforced what i call my pen wallet...which i intend to leave to jennifer...

let us see, stakecube is growing freely but i have yet to decipher the how and when of that platform although yes i did transfer with success xp coins for scc...

funny huh we are scc however we have no scc in our faucet...

meanwhile scarlet either left or was fired, replaced by daniela...

i scramble to see if perhaps i can seduce her if only to further the jealous fury within faviola...

but allow me to conclude this disjointed section with a bit more on coin...

i lament slightly not having enough inclination to invest at the point of excitement...i knew somehow that kyber and komodo would turn a profit and was proven quickly correct as one jumped to a couple of dollars from 0.9 cents or so and the other is on an upward rampage...

meaning a million could easily become two, but i dont mean this as any sort of economic advise, simply thinking out loud as it were...

you will notice i have not used the phrase all time high, the reason if not obvious should be...

to shake it, we know what we are yet not what we may become...

the only insight i have learned is that when eth rises it sure as shit maintains that level...

even on sundays when it seems a whole lot of traders go for broke and bitcoin bottoms out as if a few thousand were now a natural transition...

so what do i have, i have some, not enough to brag but possibly enough to hope that down the line them that are mine will not want for a means to survive...

other wise, ravens, pivx which has one of the nicest wallets around, redd, btt which i do not undrtstand but has shot up like a texas oil well lately, i suppose the most notable addition might be nano as it is overlooked yet fast as lightning not that i have much at all but i expect it to surprise at least as much as doge has these awful wonderful days for new currencies...now then there are several airdrops on the way and some that have started earning magically but i put no stock in these knowing well from say rowan energy or platinum dao that they can vanish without compensation...

i wonder at the crossroads, in saving a documented copy for access am i leaving too much out in the open for hackers...

dear lawyer here are my wishes and here are the keys to the kingdom...who might i trust, the old bag i suppose or the elusive genius of ms h...

anybody else might take the money and run, lately i have become obsessed with the magic flute queen of the night aria - popova 1964 feels like the favorite - which led my thoughts back to bergman and of course gemma...

wolfgang put the notes right before some of the voicings they say as a guide for some but obviously it is more than that, so much more...

i worried the vulgar little man of giant genius never got to see it performed but he did suposedly even dragged people along with him..several times...

i swear i could feel some ghostly glee as i toyed with the words in search of meaning...

my point is i have held her as my heir in terms of literary estate yet i now see how disclosing my hearts wishes might even lead to imposters and such...

also beyond that choice there is suddenly another stack of material in the way of music...

for some time i thought it simple, to each muse their respective cut yet i have not heard of such action...usually it is a package deal...

puzzled yet sticking with the plan...

as i ponder it baffles me at how many people are so willing to let it seep back into already multi millionaire banks or governments...

nothing is of course  guaranteed but i have to give it as good a shot as my own artistry which is the reason for taking all these hours between sections of this work in progress and the conclusion of el fantasma de harlot...

seemingly not enough but certainly a starting point...

the whole time viewing and re viewing thoroughbreds hopefully i really dosed this motherfucker...

oh yeah in brevity back to willy shakes, except here to say it is not always the play as evidenced in this screenplay thing wherein all the magic belongs to the two lead starlets...

in fact im flabbergasted that corey character even got a green light much less a dga credit...

perhaps he bumrushed an agent and was a scrappy fighter, lol...

all right im sorry but really stop everything and everybody to look up spork, old sport...

as for the white cat yeah there were a couple of scenes and a bittersweet climax or perhaps anti climax...

no spoilers here, tune in same time same bat coin channel...

yeah only the caped crusader and  boy wonder could pull off grimalkin or the obscure like words without worry...

and before i do not,  let me do rah rah say this venture into overtime currency activity would not have been possible without alexandra as the weirdness in letting go of her hand led me in part to collect... two collect tu cull too cool the french girl coos oui oui 

we we oh oh some things we are still too innocent to even imagine, imagine that...

da da it boggles the mind ya ya -

well at least my boogie man brain, i mean i knew the spics go ay papi but not even as a writer did i think of translation...

there be a market here boys and girls of course that first syllable is a killer is it really spicorama or japanese hai hai...

koi san croissant naya scratched up her pickers and stealers i married her and the other two or as my partner put it i dont know why i married so many women.

x6

There were cats, kittens to be precise, that day late in evening as i let the large plastic can swallow the trash...

They raced towards me as cute as life itself and then turned hesitant in the realisation that i was only human...

how much cat vibe can one man hold...

I unlocked doors and a can of tuna...returned and settled it down for them there then suddenly finding the white cat behind me unwilling to steal from the mouth of babes in a mythic stance and so i picked up a piece and this would be the first time it ate from my hand...i swear i sighed.

they ate and stuck around under a parked vehicle once in a while meowing and moving aimlessly...

i attempted without enthusiasm to secure one into safety but please understand that my lack of willingness was due as reluctance at breaking up that quartet...and a feral cat once inside will always want perhaps need to go back out into the wild...

wild is the wind, sings bowie but also what if the weirdo intrusive cvs folks got it in their heads to implant drones in these felines...

after my critique...

hmm...even so i tried later on as i heard them with insistance of help us and despite my foreboding i spent several clownish minutes working to pick one up...

they would run up to me then at two or three feet away turn back to hide...

yes much like ex wives feeling nostalgia then naseau...i imagine...

light broke and crowds neared and i gave up like a marriage based on television when the remote control flunks the battery test...

the next day which was night for me i saw the dreaded sight of one of them dead right in front of the building and another one as perplexed as americans hearing the voice of bush come through the so called president elect as the ex  a modern day dreyfuss stood to stand trial in the travesty of judgement by accusation, by insinuation...

or perhaps they knew it would be such a dull affair after faux inaguration that a side show would be required...

a man split a slant of wood and poured the poor dead thing into the trash as another failed to pick up the other stray from under another parked vehicle...

the town's no place for strays...a sad statement as if there were a prefrence for rodents...

yet all this aint the point, it is that act by the white cat no doubt hungry satisfying itself with one bite as it surveyed the tiny strangers with affection enough to be called respect...

would you - would i let children not our own enjoy our meal as we would have to wait until who knows when for the next plate? 

i was quickly and especially proud to have met and served the white cat.

cling to me kitty like the leaf clings to that tree in the song.

x7.

speaking of song, after recording those three tracks, i dreamt of riding in a tour bus...jerry garcia's bearded- teddy-bear face in a sort of sigh smile at the front...it was a trippy feeling and i couldnt get over it like some starstruck fan even if i had met some of the dead before and feel strangely at ease with bob...

i guess the truth is that in some other dimension all the spirits are doing their thing and he was obviously on the way to another gig...

as real as anything true is the only other way to describe it...

not that i am easily surprised except there have been a couple of well...

the new wife with a cast half way down her arm, i thought fracture wow it only looked like a scratch and yes it was as today pulling it off like some mad scientist magician...

voila...

the tight grey pants of left over russell oh it sounds like hollywood heyday...

man i was ready to forgive ms taylor joy for the b picture but seriously after the gambit to sell out for that motley crew , yew how few must be the high paying projects...

nearly made me want to give up watching thoroughbreds...

bitch is a witch so i wont complain much more and i can still mushroom planet wide open with the cook...

a nigger cook...ahem well a ham, it seems they are going to keep going with the shining regulation of an word...

should we propose the jubilant sounding jigaboo? 

obviously not for rap lyrics wherein anything is acceptable but outside of that...

i hear a rustling of anxiety...

no i am not saying the vice presidenta is a jigaboo...horse faced yes like minerva but nowhere near as hot but not everyone in  town has got their stimulus blow job yet...

look it looks is only skin deep.

hmm...half a jigaboo perhaps but i myself dont like labels...

now for the request section of this segment,

i put the rabbi and the disgraced neo nazi in the same room...

you know the one that had video broadcasting series and was subsequently discovered fired and made to walk that cancelled gauntlet of shame for having an opinion beyond what is considered reasonable or correct...

i tell them i have nothing against either of them but they are both so verbal especially the bi, quick esther the heimmlich i think i swallowed the babys foreskin blood, cough dry and ringing like a freshly cut penis for crying out loud they want to extetminate us you cant stand up for him ....but im not, im standing for his freedom to - well to be free...

i try to argue the french spanish and english exterminated a few populations in the empire process but i  am missing coin claim time and blurt out that hitlers bff was a little jewish girl...

or as burroughs put placed it rub out the word hitler and you rub out the word jew...paraphrase perhaps the other way around...

co founder of the state of irony...

you mean they are cocksucking vampires, nevermind that i add you are so powerful that extermination would be nearly impossible,  point in fact palastine stands no matter how many houses are leveled...

dissent and differences are necessary even if we run from them because otherwise martyrs and movements are created beyond our reach far away from control yes germany everyone stomp on the world war one kraut for what for? world war two...

politics i am not but logic should be noted now where was i oh yes rabbi let this quasi militant bloke breathe the air of freedom, he is not going to the holy land or even brooklyn...

i seen one of his transmissions and it was informative even if it went over the top at silly circus farce...but what do we expect being raised and roused by pinky and the brain along with ren and stimpy???

is it not america ??? 

im pretty sure all opinions have a place somewhere even when we dont want to hear them now please get the fuck out my room so i can get back to avoiding the spics.

x8.

when moo, cow, when moon, coin. 

it is days all later.  i was thinking these exes should become chapter titles...

electric baton inserted into vagina, my drem of havana was not sexual or even sensual instead like play mates at the horizon of a surreal sunset as we traveled through metal surfaces and locker rooms and ran away from uniformed men at a crowd of fish and miniature octopuss the water so clear yes transparent...stranfge to consider it is the only dream i have had of her...

perhaps for finding hats now so erotic that well, let us not say more...

in attempting further cloak i found myself caught up again inthe claim and calculate frenzy which gains some coin yet takes up the day and part of the night...

genevieve young love story and other books editor dead...

pee through my panties then multiple big squirts...

in an evil  translation my semen instead of bracelet pharmacy...

yes obviously i remember too much, but there was also something quirky and possibly cute in the obituary sex tape transitions...

nithing to prove and  tim to move...

but certain elements of so called family fail me as if intent on intrusion as i wonder how can they not be aware of their own transgression...

i rumor and gossip to myself backed up by one country and a few confirmations in code...

something is wrong, but not just wrong so out of whack that it even tries to turn on me as if i were crime or criminal or a curio in genital zoo...

for yourselves, as always follow the money trail and it will tell you more than i ever could...

or should, 

i keep viewing thoroughbreds, deleted at attemped rename when shedding flud for zeta downloader...

had to be the isp, one thinks...

catch the curious inside cinematic interplay from the film mogul waking up to his decapitated horse...in famed reel...

now noticing the wardrobe, as i reached for something in the fridge a door scene from the movie came to mind...

meanwhile anya recorded a perfection and isabel wroted some really good opening lines...i wanted to tell her to change the second line but have not come up with a decent alternative...alabama arkansas i love my parents too but not the way i love you...

it's nearly right...for valentine's day i put out shy of the moon much to my delight...

which brings me nearer to a point i have somewhat been avoiding that being how with song and story and books for purchase could it be that there is a need for further fortune inheritance by coin?

i don't want to say that like a lot of poetry these arts do not make a profit, because it makes them sound as if pure failure especially in such a time when commercialism is the culture, but that is most;ly the truth unless one is given to wander into the conspiracy of hexes or such...

i know that this will create a dismissive attitude for some if they had no previous knowledge when confronting them after these words in the way some city folk cringe at country music or modernists grimace at a classical orchestration...

but i have no other choice, not wantng to leave the question in the air alike some mystery i was avoiding...

furthermore, although not counted the daughters are likely to be more than many and that being said one should attempt to leave as much as possible in tact or more...

now then, the apprentice acquitted, it made me happy to hear...it should be noted that the headlines turned away from impeachment and concentrated on inciting a riot...

myself i would be locked up and licked all over if riots could be proved as poured...

 mother showing real signs of forgetfulness or perhaps foreign manipulation...

i try to go about my way secure in the knowledge that enough of what i have done is good work and this new currency is only the gravy upon those potatoes...

of course, they keep talking about all time high as if not aware of the irony when even a penny more pushes the statement back into the hstory books...

looks at the evening, the sudden lack of dream or even nightmare spic let me see your penis...

machine mouthed pump action cock suckers...

 dying to be a protagonist i suppose...

but the vulgar common denominator can only go so far even wolfgang took the time to actually do something...

i write the words of that aria, while waiting for the electric guitar strings i asked for as the nylon sits in limbo barcelona jar...

i notice the style is sometimes similar as when i revocalize a line or word, could the old bag be right we are interconnected...

no i stand by individualism but damn if it didnt feel like an ancient master was indeed sending me a message...

minutes later running into schubert and prohaska on film and arts thinking of the line i have crossed oceans of time to find you...

i don't even worry that some people will get the wrong idea as we can see after all that hyped up hoopla for a puppet president that has put the newspaper s to sleep...

some of them snoring...

bid on a bid 

why does everyone turn way away from a possible uncomfortable truth...

the reptile conjured haxan tax and so i tweeted  in defense of privacy coins...

what do i notice,  the weird silence after suggesting sister's husband is only out on bail but you see he did ship his work car over...

and what if i'm right, not that, as that would be too easy athens greece, but the possible connection of construction sale trooper and the sell a soul concert songbook gimmick? 

i digress, needing to concentrate upon matters less kafkaesque...

in any case, good for fiction if the friction ever ceases long enough to fuel those engines again...

as for the book at hand, the white cat sauntered with unusual eagerness across the street as if its tail was being pulled by nvisible spacemen and i waited around with a piece of turkey until it slid near ignoring the turkey and slipping under the car as if joining me in mourning for the lost kitten and letting me know that from cat heaven came the whispers of its immortality in these pages as a noble cat in a corrupt town...leftover chicken preceeded that incident and prok chop continued..

suspicious at the fowl and hid to eat ...

yet , expectant at the meat and searching for more...

aint we all?

hmm,

alabama arkansas i like that movie too but not the way i love you...

alabama arkansas i need skies of blue but not the way that i need you...

x9.

well the thought to edot edit made me ray charles could see just fine what id say hey hey but is thete thete there another arkansas...

hmm havana wore a pearl necklace and i worried or wondered...

what if...

columbian confession dick in a water bottle before the girl drinks...

messenger messages mess...

marilyn under investigation by the sherriff on my trail a friend of the devil...

i played it cool with depp but seen what went down when allen said wine was not so bad made me realize one simply cannot even defend in the innocent till proven press...

who knows, i dunno...i suppose only the women should say tell but what if it is a timed revenge...

yeah some folks are simply due, i felt it that time he fell in concert...a multilayered crash as if someone had to die...

still, to burn out like that, man it aint even thinkable...

like no dream then dave with amphetamines and van the lux life...

the ex wife kissing in concert...

i was at the store shoulder heavy shouting in my head over cutting my hair...

i procrastinate...

the obituary party takes up most of the night as yes the term ath becomes the irony i warned...

word play like a blockchain with confirmations...theres something about cameron diaz and that south american nun that died...

what ride, which aliens, the white cat first time by the side we both turn forward i send in the salami taking a bite for myself in the process...

haunted by the line my boys are getting in that ass tonight creep their kind every where even inka felt it asking them to please unfollow...

but with her lolita enhanced looks heightened by scenery well we could spend a lifetome fighting scary monsters...

newly haunted by the neon demon...

ad away as i admit not considering elle much after the great which was fairly goodly...

save for the egg memory the other day...

yeah yeah  that is it but why am i writing this now, these thoughts...

well it is more or less what a writer does...

ada over a dollar meaning for myself sixty easy bucks from a few cents invested months ago here i ago feeling millionaire at forty short of a hundred...

sorry i drink coffee and confuse excitement with caffeine smoking joy...

thank you bitches for kicking my ass at masturbating to michelle galvan...

x10

in the,east, the far east...easton somehow beyond my bruce lee cut, came to mind...

back to it in a minute,

havana said she slept most of the day and my new daughter took her first bite...

i thought all the way down the line to when gemma was then and i reasoned that either a man can only feel like a father once or that this kid looks so much like me that it is unsettling in sweet mannrr of speaking then i did so siesta nap spanning into a dream through a door a pregnant woman shorter than i so as touching the side of breast insyed of belly but then yes like that seven month abandoned woman some years ago ears i go is the thing i dislike about haircut...

one temds to feel irish...at that juncture...

now then temds oh wait i thought yocandy you know the last four digits but perhaps yonaudy one could get yoyo with the yo...

yolanda yola yelling young...

if 27 is old them twenty is middle age...

she is twenty and like twin peaks that dog has three more legs...

raw dog aint never been so complicated...

i pick my nose flip wanting to steal the phrasr complicated shadows...

instead i rework the domain with an aluminum bat...

nothing is true everything is australian...

australia is how i met teska...

now then lily...

it seems to say lawful marriage or die sort of like ride or die but more intense by far or bat if you will base the balls...

all deep inside i creep wondering over her lips and the orgasm vasilisa entitled the perfect one...

the day followed slow and silent like a spy at a corner waiting...

not that we need such action now with surveillance equipment lamp post and satellite yet i let the line stand...

some are stripped of military honors and others are merely strippers...

duck low, imagine that...yellen not yeltsin...

the current bid stands at chinese currency gone all the way crypto...

the miner wont register outside certain area codes...

it is cute, yet to yhink one day all the money is going to be blockchained well, to utter in a usual stoned under skyscraper cities wow...

in any case i like lily i love lily and was enthralled by her care of kittens...

i cant imagine her liking or much less loving me yet i suspect she is into one or two of our songs...no i have not forgot lauren...but if it allows me to live well obviously...

yes. isabel can take me to church...

perhaps in perth where are you tilda and your one single drop of blood driving through vein bloodstream like a blue madness maybe it was a dream...

i play the words insanely back forth or rearranged...

worryingly senselessly yet once in a while indeed eureka...

but suddenly i was inspecting the thoroughbred scenes instead of saving them in the quiet sound of minds eye...

arturo bully obituary tutor fucks his student on her house perhaps meaning in her house..

but roof sex has been known to top the floors mop the doors cop the shores...

mister saturday night special skynyrd six feet in the hole...

writer waits down in the hole...

be water, my friend. im lost in a highway of my self walking not riding waiting not winning anything other than this present moment precise in its own doubt knowing it will be past even as fast as the period is placed.

x11

oh boy oh man oh god...

what is in room 237, update notice as i turn my bellyache over to thumb type at least...

well what exactly, there is an outline from the previous day but any attempt at prose was derailed by faulty plumbing as i turned and twisted pipes at noon and midnight while bitcoin dropped a bundle and it wasnt even sunday...

here it is three thirty seven...

the bright feeling was only the memory of a note i wroted one of my sweet sixteens...

i cant write now for this bloated feeling but i want to pen how my j crew shirt ripped as if in mourning for one...as i slid into bed...yesterday after hearing of that death...

next day follows with numbers as outlined previously

1 shlomo...yes shlomo died and at the very merry moment of some secret realization

bam

2 bird _ a pigeon young and thug tough in my balcony fluttering here and there, i knew the type aggressive and intent and wished it away...entranced by synchronicity  and my own stupidity...

how could i fail to connect lily with atj...or worse did it really take me dozens of views to remember lily was raped by wetbacks...circa nineties texas town ship that sailed in long conversation concert once upon a talk...

or even figure for sure if that is the name of odeya father, to think of him and six sons all making fourteen testicles is truly a thought...

3 out on court bail...america ruled by the mob oh boy oh man oh god...now we could talk all night about what is criminal or not but i will leave it at the possible impossible position that one man on the run might suffice for votes...

forrest gump just felt like running...take the money and run...janet obituary also nineties brings to mind that perhaps my improvised ideas concerning sister were not merely flights of fancy...books are written to be read at certain times it seems, will it be timely or will it be too late, i do not worry yet i do feel something is awful wrong...

with them with her not the ferlinghetti prosepoemnovella but that regatta scene...

i say it but only to a maze in the riddle of salvation or ruin...

now then 4 hes wearing a hat and i was wanting something other even to self irony shorter but i tried it today head only covered by ray bans as the entire staff of the dry cleaners slipped past me for reasons i cannot explain...but the point is some of the strands are still so entangled that i really am perplexed in which way to detangle...

i suspect if paul mitchell werent so expensive then this would not be an issue...

it is like health care when you die for lack of pill or procedure...

5 shorn, my how i adore say or see and even more now and that story even if a bit sugary except of course i trembled at having to remember machine gun roadblock insanity soldiers on motorcycle 

were you dancing in a red ski /rt

or even how much lack of patience i display with my own mother although often justified by her natural stance in things such as cats or men do not know anything about kitchens...you see i do not feel certain exaggerations can coexist with logic as it all would or might lead to chaos or worse a severe repetition than blinds one from reason and obviously you might know not this meaning but give it a try, pick a lie or if you dislike untruth a name along with some associated action and repeat it with serious intemsity to someone nearby a dozen times in a few minutes and ask them how they feel after words in the aftermath.

6 vik and naked geese were with me in the shower and she wanted to make love amd seeing as the geese vanished i sort of agreed..

10 gardel and imitations, there is tango but there is only gardel...some one said nobody has been able to imitate him and it led me to a missing the whole fucking point meltdown...

i tried to explain that imitation was always possible but not nowhere the power of them songs in that genre...

easier to do in rock and roll i presume well until the seventies...

lisa has that sucking in the seventies lp...

we wroted feeling that our song easter didnt suck 11 rita houston but instead of a response or fuv airplay we got an obituary...

i think of this on two levels...an ultimate favor to save aforementioned other instead of sayong hey we have a house in mexico exvlammation point daily raid et ceyera because some people go that exyra mile while others kill all that is good in the whole wide world that was or the shock of how  that  track rocked awoke in her the ultimate countdown...

hell, i even started recounting all my riots as if it could have beem ny fault ahem catholic guilt upbringing  ringing anything turns to shame in the purgatory of wall pictures despite no worship crave false or french.

but seriously did the mob rob me of air play...

lovely rita she's leaving, ho, land ho...

ho ho ho there aint no sanity clause.

i had to pause from aria intent as it seemd stranger than usual forces upset at my ease and connection to well im not sure i only know that my talent is not so strong to sustain through such disyraction...further one might add that at no fantasy do i dare even think myself in the same category as Johannes Chrysostomus W Theophilus M...

having postulated a possible message...thought it should not be left up to debate or question, talent, genius we may have some fragments or had the potential but real deal exquisite sublime sensation we feel is nearly exclusive to a long ago era and he was a prime example or as burroughs put placed it we are only foot soldiers in the squadron...

anyway i hope i can get back to learning that song from lucia popp as i love it so...

fairy foe couldn't didn’t speak until he was four, 

fairy foe did not  could not walk until he was eight,

 enemy fairy foe was barely able to chew due to his deformed jaw. 

fairy foes life was ephemeral as an early kinks song...

His autopsy report is a staggering read.

the author copied all his red white notes from it.

 It states that after his death fairy foe had no blood,

not even a tilda swinton drop...

 a heart the size of a peppercorn, 

yes yup yeah peppercorn...along with corroded lungs...

mar maria pets her puppy dog, it is bug eyed and seems to smile, i produce the film and mail it to her adding that i cannot see this post in one of timelines and now to wait upon her response preparrd to let this perfect love go...

in a sense it is what i am herein doing, letting it go unconcerned iver over form or fashion and although still wanting no orgy finding these sorts of flames arisen as if for multiple or multiplied satisfactions...

meanwhile a woman plowed her car smack into the belly of a bakery...

i watched a few minutrs enough as mother tackled a night at regatta...

we do not know what may ha ha happen hh pens, 

weighing away the worry of danger i dove into wordplay to see if there was anything to say...

there is,  yet wisdom like god does not speak...

desides besides without dreams there is nothing to tell...

i will say that it seems nay not seems it is as if minds now come prejudged despite religion or logic or constitution and so willing to judge that it might make the minority report a documentary...

i have always felt it as a writer, but now it feels amplified determined like the human race at pollution...

i think, i am taling taking notes, in yhe the privacy of my private home...

perhaps once in a while with what might be a mutual spirit well yes felines too... but how is such then thus set as it wrte were in stone? settled...

meanwhile potatoes ehgs onion pepper but thr orange juice was weird like the girl that said her nipples were always on...

in terms of that, i meant cm should attempt a more aggresive or even sensual style in order to attract numbers, it is after all an unfotunate truth not that i even remotely agree with that sort of thing but imagine putting it all on the line to be a model nevermund the competition inly to see your crowd dwindle for perhaps being correct...cruel world.

the tome takes me at complications, yes i shoulde be shoulder, clear - precise - real, and punctuated but how can you expect anything other than stream of present from a poet...

for example, my plan was to play upon an obituary right said fred...

yet how can i continue wuth with anything other than yes charlie has gone away to cat heaven...

i know how much she adores loves cherishes her pets and so i find it necessary to say instead...

instead of whrrr where i was going...

as,i learn you caint actually feed them salami, seemed fine tho and gave the white cat turkey after yet have not seen since...

in egypt the cats were given special burial grounds which tells you more than i could if we can agree that there is something mystical magical mysterious about that ancient land .

finally i say there can be no way around it, survive until we get this settled and then see what happens besides you saved her actual life twice before and it should count for something but it doesnt and thereing lies the problem when you know that the sky and sea are greater than you dust to disco dust and that the real issues are nuclear waste and life on mars or not and end of pandemic and all the things in everybody more important than you cupboard et cetera why i started to collect glass elephants when i was twelve and now look at my collection in fact i have moved twice because i ran outta space you know how it goes bla bla bla oh fuck were is my bat notification or have the ads dwindled down to sibling rivalry once upon a time they would not leave and it got the writer to thinking maybe they are on the lam and the next he knew he was neck deep in conspiracy theories...

after all is said and not done i found myself on the wrong side of paradise tears, fears not of dying as the subject is peril to all but to think that critics or others would think any of my writing as lifted or plagiarism - 

it was only a thought yet let me overreact.

burroughs said you can't fake quality any more than a goodly meal and indeed but moreover than the eats it is a question at least for self of respect that is if say a passage is stolen and passed off like counterfeit bills how would one ever be at peace with that knowledge...

not the money but the magic..

the pope flies to irag and realizes there is no difference with some roman suburbs...

now then, when i say religoo i mean if you have faith you won't need a ceremony...

back to the point, it would not only be foolish but entirely uncomfortable to lift a line as if it were mine...i do employ remembrances which include the work of some i admire but i xpect the reader to be enlightened by say "keep my skillet greasy if I can" as originating from the blues or as the case may be not to suspect it as an attempt at cheap copy even when copy pasted it is its own product as when one might ingredients for a  libation...of course, or especially in brim i tried to eradicate the quotation mark (you really dosed this motherfucker up) and said so clearly in order to entertain the reader by swinging in quotes and such without attribution yet certain in my intent collage of word in imagist style grimace...now to needlessly confess a fault i did once read out lyrics to a girl saying they were mine but they werent' long ago over long distance call but i do find as i reflect upon the foible that it was not for profit nor to publish as it was simply an impulse to get her attention plus as later i myself wroted songs i find that it was prophetic in that song lyrics in a good percentage are not all that pinpoint exact as the tradition often requires that reference of recognition so possibly a lesson be that as it may i say again i have not here or anywhere plagiarised and if squiggly punctuation was missing it was to not break up a style.

that is on purpose fully expecting the reader to realize that say blessed are them or they is obvious mount sermon but this novel these notes are bad enough without having to make it worse by elaborating on what should be perfectly logical.

you are playing a machine and the machine doesn't play.

sometimes a nearby fire sounds out its rumble as if a downpour from the heavens as you lay in a fine bed drifting into dreams until the smoke gets in your eyes as the antique song once said. 

you are playing against a machine and that machine is programmed to win, only a miracle can sometimes short circuit the hardwired algorithm.

you are playing against a machine and that machine is programmed to win, only a miracle can sometimes short circuit the hardwired algorithm.

dream of a girl i used to know, or so the scene said feeling at ease perhaps even content

now here is what this chapter would have held if vulgarity had not forced the poet onto reflections of society's corruption...

the white cat two pork chops

i dream of the london jinni as if we were friends like a fantasy turned love true

if coyrse i cannot write about that but the details escape even before i can consider the pen.

the day pours out nearly into nothing,

whem i dream again it is a full house in 3k, an old woman alike a hated neighbor here trying to get into my room i pull her out with a broom then she pretends to fall at the door from the supposed force of the stick i sigh exasperated with the memory of her yelling and her daughters yelling and her grandsons yelling and begging like some secret assassination plot that might reignite at any turn,

(they say he beats her and violates the unsuspecting but i think both are tales told to hearsay into lunacy claiming he is not right in the skull yet somehow capable of coming and going) 

anyway in the dream  is it her that has left or me

 (system of irony spic have someone walk out as you walk in insisting you are not you or wailing to be let in for lack of key over and over  only to attempt to replace your standing by dislodging tranquility that is to say abracadabra as it were)

as i find myself wandering some other dream place suddenly introduced into intimacy with frances who seems on reflection like miley then positively more like maise...

the intimacy is only in nearness except at one point i walked as if 9down dawn amsterdam to curve into morningside,

desolate streets then settled with her again,

but she has met a man that she likes and their cuddle turns into a type of date rape then her violence against him herself i sat seeing split into two one of them male and the female calls the male self name  as if to reunite she looks at my wonder and in woe says my vagina is torn.

i get up then with the naked image of her and the idol song sweet sixteen which we covered thrice resounding gently in my thoughts...

i think to re record the track to make it just like the thought in suddenly gone lust in my head but then no i mean what is the point of musical exactitude when unlimited variations are available, fidelity is yet a subject i prefer within love

post script jennifer had a kafkaesque dream she told me perhaps related to her turkish trip,

and the song i wroted for her with the space witch mentions a skinny franz kafka sneeze when of course i was down on my knees for her...

down in a dream walking home, this after some sort of stock trade neon activity, there is a tennis player, a woman like the one in a pink dress, blonde but now dressed in white,then another woman joins me as i open the door wondering if the kay is the same she says she wants to speak to someone and i say there is no one there but a man is  there beyond  door in a kissing frenzy...

i cant believe my nap, 

its lika press conference followed by a twister through three states because the president cannit fart...or something equally wicked.

Usury rusts the man and his chisel

 It destroys the craftsman, destroying craft;

 Azure is caught with cancer. Emerald comes to no Memling

 Usury kills the child in the womb

 And breaks short the young man's courting

 Usury brings age into youth; it lies between the bride

 and the bridegroom

 Usury is against Nature's increase.

 Whores for Eleusis;

 Under usury no stone is cut smooth

Between murderous vicious physical attacks now involving slashing of small Jewish children on the main streets of America’s largest city and verbal attacks weakened support for the Jewish homeland by Democratic Party politicians it’s really looking bad there for American Jews and weirdest of all is the “ progressive “ American Jew supporting these same anti Semitic sectors ..” bizarre” doesn’t do Justice....

and

It's important to mention a fact which is known to anyone who resides in these neighborhoods in New York, but perhaps isn't known abroad. These attacks are always, or almost always, perpetrated by local African Americans. When Israelis or people from the rest of the country are told that the most avidly Jew-hating people in urban America are Black Americans, they're surprised, because of the Jewish involvement in civil rights, and the media narrative about the rise of white supremacy, which is minor. This isn't racism, which is discriminating against someone on basis of their race, but rather a statement of fact, uncomfortable as it may be. There is an endemic problem of violent anti-semitism in many sectors of urban, particulartly north east, Black American communities. This is relevant to note.

it is relevant, not only to bitten jews...

drifting 8nto dream, easy as a rider upon a cl9ud when the building gate slammed sunday  night was it saturday...i stayed up a while considering how still noise rattles me, it happened again within dreams sending me into studio and search through nervous paranoia, later dreaming hallway 424 incense lighting and a wax doll...i was fixing after a long days night into porn, i actually viewed after kristy, melissa king and her ball kiss move, but then as if doomed to research as the prices of medicine skyrocket in the states seemingly to pay for the first ladys stockings, i find alyssa funke...the heart mind tattoo tongue pierced stillwater praxtice porn a month later shotgun yacht on aunt lalys birthday...details hazy like partly declassified stories...

i went back to sleep till the afternoon, when i went out for smokes another dead hidden roach was at the front door...

how could i make it up? 

as i waited to galvan;

 i noticed ambulance, a pick up truck, and a delivery bike all cavorting at the entrance, the driver eating a banana...

a joke it seemed...

i was not laughing but could not decide which of two or three neighbors i wished away more...

galvan was seriously dressed to impress but those notes are for another tome to book...

i will say i felt myself flow into her as if hypnotized and i would not be surprised if i heard she was pregnant again...

i tried to ease my self by watering the plants...

the headline said over three hundred spic cops were terminated but it did not make me as happy as suspicious especially with i the vg in town and no phone call ringing.

i dreamt setting up equipment, the glowing light display flickering languages german ukrainian and i thought finally a dream beyond the confines of limitation and although the day held no pure freedom, i thought it qould be a goodly ending for these notes. you will think the jinni is karla,  but i will not confirm despradel. there is however steak and pork chops sitting easy in the ice box awainting the white cat's return...a couple of days of rain, tonight again, until next time.



Into november

october. the writer sat with the hint of pain still in his left leg. it had, the pain, throbbing like a fresh cut, moved from a few places in his back down to his thigh and now held sway between ca;f and ankle...imaginary perhaps, but enough to prevent him from stirring up the notes and outline of his new novel. it would have been the perfect day for it given the anniversary. parts of it were based on chinese history and it was the seventieth year of reds...red dream down a tree, perhaps, he weighed we are all buried and dead and simply dealing with the weight of the aftermath alas it seems even in the ha;lls of hell there are factions and with chainsaws no less luckily someone on our side carried one as well...he was surrounded by men when the pain began and held a picture of one them kicking him in the back where it hurt and he put placed it in his right pocket as they attacked again...the move came when confronted by a human non smoking sign...of course you can smoke if only electronic cigarettes...judgement was everywhere and the 2002 ballot of trump and weinstein seemed in terrible trouble...of course he was not political but would have taken a writing job for hire...the rich, you will learn never pay oh this old thing it's called swag and these are contributions...at least he had gotten sweet clear frames...not that he needed them up close as his vision had improved for favoring audio books over traditional pages...the writer lived alone and once again found himself in possession of two houses...currently he was trying to decide how to lessen the worship of woman that turned out to only want a spiritual relationship...rats, rats the sixe of cats as david bowie painted, yes rats and orgies circled three underground cult undercover records followed yet the touch that he so desperatel;y wanted eluded him like a shadow in the foggy night...he argued to himself that too much had gone down this year and there needed to be time between projects still he responded to an offer to publish a novel and selected a seven year old manuscript dear to his heart...what is time...time is what...you missed a payment they said although he had not ever missed any payments and switched cell phone providers...all the while falling in love, how could he still be falling in love...in lust more like it with women that hardly knew his name..he stood for a cigarette,paced back, breathing, the pain also breathing..all day a knock out lay in bed waiting to write since it was october.

october only to have the irony of waiting...sixteen felpro tablets...eight hundred milligrams...although not his, it hu 

rt.

october. the lazy evening breeze brought n midnight as if to ease the madness of wondering over a sliding pain as the spies started reading his words even before the first draft was done...

october. drowning in spies and data mongers...nobody was as right as norman, the writer pens freely like a jungle animal and then is trapped in a cage of public zoo...

october. invisible bars. invisble condoms. eyes without a face. pain without a source...might be a hit record so hot it hurts like hell...

october. i can't wait to type up the porn chapter.

just like homosexuality is a great cover for an agent, literary intent is a great cover for viewing porn of course these days are very different than say when burroughs and bowie were watching pornography...

still, he had no excuse for the throbbing pain which turned on and off through his leg...

it all pointed to sciatica...sciatica somehow...

strangely, he liked the word. like bovine or a number of others which sounded melodious to his sometime poetic ear...

in searching how to sit with sciatica, the query returned ; a standing desk...

perhaps, he could no longer be a writer, ,aybe he had over written...

let's see, a few thousand poems, several dozen stories,  a few dozen songs, a handful of novels, and a couple of screenplays...

of course, volume or volumes didn't much matter to him - more often than not it was the act of pen and paper or typing a series of words which led to dreams or truth...

as this, where notes for a novel were already in yet there was something in front of him -

the rule is even if there are no rules is to write what is in front of you...

he pondered now at the times the hoi polloi pressed their way behind him as if to say surprise you didn't even notice us...

could that be it, all those sliding shadows as one is standing there...

this needs to be better expressed...

often or often enough at the supermarket, men or usually men would sneak through the narrow space of the so-called line so as to only be noticed at the instance of passing or after to which he responded by being more alert and turning a shoe or pointing an elbow or in the best of cases jetting out the sharp end of the umbrella - yes a bit mean but the lack delicacy without so much as a pardon me or any other word seemed to him to demand an equal type of agreesion... in any case the point is stress and trauma - which that sort of thing produces  easily in the wasted minutes of worry...did i turn my head once too quickly and dislodge my spine...

who can tell - was it the that last pull away at the hunger filled insomnia stop as the guard attempted to frisk me for a weapon ?

could be anything this sort of thing but he was not prepared to buy the sciatica estate although it has a nice garden for ennui...

the whole world should get rid of any beer that is in't german purity...

one spaten and he cursed the pain so hard with a foot stomping seriousness that must have raised demons from the atomic age...

he waitied and rested and sucked at red wine before facing the horror of another pain filled walk...

he was luckily sweetly distracted by women and realized some might be with him even through the frenzy of pain which he lamented for who would want to share a hurt?

ah yes except for religion where it's all about suffering...the memory of these gods inspired him to pray for the death of some his neighbors but then he was concerned that in the event of actual expiration he would have to respond by attending church...

mysteriously the following day a needle appeared stuck through his right shoe which he sensed somehow and pulled out with tweezers...

extremely strange given that he has not recently taken to needle and thread...

he loved that lesson from gradeschool...

sewing, in a manner of speaking he was till sewing except it was with words...

in a dream he is getting into a large car, a large gray car with his mother...

he awakes, hungover and sour mouthed, without feeling except for the concern that pain will return - for a few minutes he languishes without language breathing in the fine feeling of normality alas as soon as he rises it strikes like japanese kamikazes against a carrier's flight deck...

it's three hours before he faces his guitar and then these paragraphs...

one hundred and eighty minutes of perhaps if i stretch or maybe if lean thisaway or thataway all of it the worse for him...

he lights a cigarette and considers how there is a parallel between writing or more exactly over writing and sciatica...

prevention - just like the pain prevents certain activities all the writing means there is more to edit...

now then the astute reader might ask, how then did he sit down and write these notes,

well after coffee he chased down sixteen hundred milligrams of a pain killer...

wouldn't you?

days later, a few times the pain faded so completely he thought for sure that would be that -

alas, only to return, the longest stretch came when he confronted with logic; sleeping is painless and proceeded to sleep walk as it were ...

for a minute he thought he could write on sunday...

the sentence came to him easy;

we live in the days of forced nostalgia of sequels remakes and prequels...

forced nostalgia, it got him excited but as soon as he plugged in the usb port for the typewriter cell phone contraption there it was throbbing like a telegraph headline...

ten minutes to monday.

next ring no phone it's thursday closing n on friday...

days simply sliding away from the jolt of pain...

he wamts to write yet much like sadness he don't want to do it while distracted...

reporting to the page only to not let a couplde of dream scenes escape...

he's with a girl, blonde five inches over five feet with a little girl i don't really look at for being entertained by the thought that it might be sam...thinking of the recently published novel...the setting is a school a cafetira or lunch counter...we are speaking about a phone and very near each other as ihe says but i don't have your number to which she replies with a request for a selfie...at which point he awakes amazed at the aspect of or sense of reality in the scene then considering that it might have been isabella who indeed has a little sister he hasn't actually looked at...

next day, he dreams of elsa and she's fighting off his father and men in the same body that look alike...it's the halllway of apartment three k....he grabs her hand pulling her away from them and gets up worried because she is he considers a magical being a warrior beauty...

there is no sound but she shows up in las vegas with a caution that seemed to reflect some truth in the sequence...

spanish they say is the loving tongue however for him there is an element of repulsion which happens when trying to carry on in that language through imagination since it brings back all too easily memories and characters not to his liking...

placing the read aloud function on cities of the red night, he drifts off into a dream wherein he makes a stop for some beverage before going on to head off a flood in some town that felt like the southern section of the united states...

that kind of work is foreign to him...quickly he weighs the coldness of the crowd..sure, we'll post a picture to pray for this or that and maybe even echo the news when it's too late to do anything about et cetera of course, he is no better than they and perhaps worse...yet in his heart of hearts there is a wishing for some sort of exact equality no equilibrium...

ten beers and he can't even fuck that woman...

nigger wops, government songs climbing the charts...

there is no - aint been - and won't be equality especially in economic terms...

what do you mean ghandi hated the darkies?!?

he cannot stop learning stop yearning stop dreaming...

meanwhile the orgy continues as if a circus jumping through his thoughts...

thought jump mind skip vision pump and whip...

hammers in hong kong plane stammers instead he writes this song.

***

the now nearly ancient panasonic answering machine is in an amazon delivery box...an argument follows as i avoid certain people...

there is a girl with a neat body in a tight tee, he is writing just above the breasts before going to the supermarket...

he'd always paid more attention to the western lands and perhaps especially the place of dead roads, but now he considers cities of the red night nearly equally enticing and positively more insightful as it seemed to announce an oncoming era...uncommon yet filled with straight passages as if inviting the run of the mill readers into the trilogy...

all this to say i am going to browse through it again at least once more before moving on to harlot's ghost...

mailer said he was a genius and right he was, in the preface he mentions gysin painted the book before it was writtem elsewhere he said writing is years behind painting...

he thinks of this now as the pain comes and goes...the printed page projections and his own typewriter dream now seemingly lifted from this prose before reading it...

which perhaps turns this all into a diary of sorts the diary of pain...

well, hopefully soon enough this will be concluded and the manuscript can get a word in -

not yet huh?

well, nightmare, he means literal...at some sort of old style western trading station made of wood like one of those banks one might encounter in a an early hollywood cowboy movie well even a later hollywood cowboy films he turns away to walk out but finds his wallet is missing...he finds on the steps along with some other personal documents he was not carrying at the time and collects them in worry with the money missing and enters again to notice a type of army mess hall with soldiers eating at a very long table on  side all female but it is a tall man that stands when he asks if anyone speaks english and starts to explain what has transpired as if regressing to childhood well an interrogated childhood wherein someone is searching for exact details...awoke in panic feeling it was pretty near to some sort of reality...so much so that he checked his wallet before returning to another round of sleep...

strangely, he dreamt his ritz carlton dream again that is checking in but next to him was a family friend, someone he does not actually hold in high esteem and someone he has never actually been alone with...in any case he gets the keys to a room on the elevnth floor but when he opens the door there are two women inside, both men run and both women give chase catching them at the end of the hall where he hands them the keys and starts to awake wondering why on earth he'd be dreaming of someone so far removed from thought...

twelve hours ago, it seems like minutes.

switched bed. he dragged the mattresses back and forth as if drgugged on some elusive certainty...

the firmness helped as he created new images for one of his muses, perhaps his most important muse...

he drifted off into dreams upomn  the firmer bed after revolving door fantasy...

in the dream he was back in his old room, however something felt crowded, strangers lurked without regard to setting,,,he tried to remove them yet was outnumbered...just like the revolving door fantasy except in the dream it was mostly men except for one thin blonde that walked his way to lay down for nap but was yanked away and set on a table like fruit to be devoured...her pink flesh exposed as one of them trampled over the flesh with his hand...he went back to his room slightly upset and dressed in different clothes clothes that could hide a weapon...with the hammer in his pocket he stepped out again yet nicer men tried to make him see their point of view it was a party and why not enjoy it...the air conditioner broken someone asked if he knew a repairman he thought of one but did not respond the apartment folded out into a very large space, masionesque with people in every room...then suddenly outside encountering a squadron about to bust some unsuspecting wrongdoer one of them handed him a rifle, a modern metallic barreledlight weight automatic which he took and sauntered  up road to get to a sniper position through the hotel bar and up some narrow stairs which he was told would lead to the roof but before the roof there were sleeping rooms with sliding doors and several women wrapped only in blankets descended as he climbed then curiosity, pushing through some of the doors he saw the rooms only had large beds sometimes two beds placed next to each other one of the women said never sleep here a flight up indexes of vide tapeds and some video tapes seemingly discarded alongside in front of a cloudy window when he realized he was o longer carrying the shot gun...wavering he awoke hoping the pain would have passed and although it was better by far it was still there haunting him as a coffee and cigarette moment to type up the scenes had to be pushed along by a painkiller.

the newspaper claiming exchange rates will be stable but they hardly ever are at least not in the lonjg run...

his new glasses remind him of his second girl friend which often calls his first...

nearly clear frames which can be termed either grey or some light tone of hazy blue...

celine, but he considers they might be a knock off of the brand name which would explain the argument when he reversed the order to subtract tint...

basically making them free especially in contrast to a usual price tag...

well, they are nice enough to be the brand name, not that it matters in the other long run...

after the rains the early morning is cool with a breeze that sings yet does not raise the curtains...

at the second cigarette his pain subsides...stock earnings for his new shares are due today and he hopes it is good...

of course nothing wil be that good with pain...

he feels it not so much yet knows that he has not rested in fact he might have overdone it what with cleaning and then the switch...

and thus back to horizontal.

Quick dream of a wristwatch purchase...

Realization that it might have been the soft memory foam...

a day of joy nearly pain free swiftl;y followed by a return to writhing upon waking he noticed the throbbing affects the dream cycle only remembering the familiar face of a woman he could not place before being consumed by the thought of how much it hurt...

he could not say if it was the bed or the fact that he spoke of the bed thus turning the solution on its head...

in either the case, despite the evidence, the switch did help...

once in a while he has dreamt of weapons, kinves and guns, yet rarely are guns fired...in fact he can't recall a scene with spent bullets yet last night a man stood over another man and shot him in the knee, the shot man's reaction was casual and the shooter responded by firing three more bullets into the knee until the wounds made him stumble down onto the ground...

the abscence of blood and the miniature puncture holes indicate fiction of some sort as the caliber appeared to be a thirty eight or even a forty five...

pain yet and he's dreading the bath which has not been enjoyable since this started...

he suspects too, the dosage is losing effect within continued use...

still, unwiling to increase the supply to the bloodstream as it is for the logical reason not to mention it may well be an external condition imposed by another.

saturday goes by quickly. he got up at noon with the electricity out. at two it was back but did not help the pain.

he started reading harlot's ghost...it had been on his reading list for years,,,he had read most of mailer's work and felt some sort of spooky kinship with the elfish jew that spoke in a southern accent when he encountered him in a bookstore...there'd been a time when they had fought together entirely dismanteling another writer in the process and he ponders now he had always had one foot in the grave ever since he put pen to paper...burroughs too claims it is all one book...another look at naked lunch...he thought for a few minutes but then there were the ending credits...as for the novel, hundreds of pages left to go...thus far it is slick, slick in a way that needs experience to understand which is perhaps why he let it go so long to weed out the hoi polloi and the subway dime store readers...it is, in fact possibly only a book for writers to enjoy...he can see here and there the genesis of castle in the forest...the unformed idea being divulged to the attentive listener...how horrid it it for him to even glance at the thought of attempting to complete that trilogy...of course, not as awful as other thoughts and he knows he could yet it would not be his place not exactly although it might be a pleasure...

in the pleasures of a hotel he is handed one of those bracelets and a single key to a room whose location is unknown to him and he saunters about asking and lurking and looking for the entrance when he encounters a woman with a man - she in bikini and for some reason the man in immediate fight soon overthrown he tackles the girl in a sexual way spanking her left side red and then inserting the glue stick as it were where suddenly wet dream set awake...was it was it not...

another carrying an automatic handgun, thin and black as in those italian makes or perhaps russian even maybe german...he did not inspect and walked into the bathroom to wonder where the gun had vanished or how...

now driving sixty miles an hour in the back of a large american car on a two lane road...not feeling the breeze however and awake wanting more air, the type which trembles by a lowered window as the wheels spin...

pin mildred we didn't ever really speak or did we know yet in the dream there she is and we are talking it felt like we were both taller than we were or are...something about a reminder...perhaps a remainder...he fears too much talk in scenes just like he does in waking life with the type of folks that make him suspicious...now then he is not suspicious of mildred little blonde who grew yonder while he opium not naseau hash not in cryptocurrency terminology...

well, some of these things are real and while reading of the farm the last thing he wants or needs is a masked women making him spill information he otherwise would not...should not...

shoulder, a minute too long to find these notes after spending a goodly while investigating a second backup plan...it's all in place...inclination tron, he has some but wants a few more...a day long journey through carbon money only to wait another day - the card approved but then some sort of extra thing which they said needed to be cleared by their security team...tits, before it had been a mix up with the phone number...hopefully, this won't need to attract my attention after getting resolved...he felt good last night, halloween, even in the bath with a spaten...however it did not last, awaking all too early in the middle of the night there it was steadily throbbing as if he had not rested at all...in fact, the place is a mess awaiting that sensation of go-getter clean up and wash...

he don't mind the mess, there being no one else there, that is until a certain point.

street clearing rain poured when he walked outside and then it paused suddenly as if to ask questions...

dickinson yes one of hisfirst loves...the reason of his red poems that is to pen twelve hundred or so verses in a matter of weeks...there she is in a sit com sit for situation com for comedy...hailee looks a touch like her...i hope to get to that soon yet cynthia still holds the cards in that department as far as feeling...am her st...yes the church has got them beat with the saints...yr grins at me as they continue the talk of names...

day of the dead and he's attempting to moisturize his head.

one of m

st-one s-tw0

dreaming with blurred images, there is a woman with ample chest covered in a leafy color that is when the leaves are still on hrthe tree...he can't see her for looking...

he thinks of yona whom he told would be elena yet the scene feels english...he gets up excited over a possible place for his new manuscript yet distracted by the delay in that carbon money tron deal...

the pizza arrived quick and hot...some eats never loose their charm...

reading however he became disenchanted by the growing up sections, a male centric affair made worse by a misplaced blow job but soon after nkm regains his balance and brings a pretty flirtation followed by the early experiences at the cia in the mid fifties...a few hundred pages only in yet back on balance...still one too many mentions of hemingway no matter the interrogation exercise brings you right into the sequence...

struggled after dawn, he went to bed and got up as if waiting for something that surely would not arrive yet foolish hope springs eternal...finally, denying his hunger for having had half a pie earlier and his own skinny logic he drifted into a dream...

he seemed to be hiding with some other poeple in his old home, would it always be his home, he pondered, wondered even after the move which he was not even informed of...he supposes it was sort of nkm's house too...maybe the place is packed with spirits he had called forth with his casual magic...

in any case, alike the moment when naked with a girlfriend wherein he picked up a knife and ran around in circles at the turning of the front door until racing to his room...he rushed with alina into the main room and peered at an old woman in a red coat...he had some prior roots there too, when first pregnant lilia appeared in a bright red coat....in the dream it is not her and suddenly the main room's door is adjusting against his touch until he leaves it dangling sideways against the frame...he tells alina to get into the closet...she does and he senses the old woman in the red coat nearing...ms adler perhaps from the typewriter shop...suddenly he overhears a voice telling alina she feels like a virgin and something about his hard on yet the feeling of sex is upon him althoughhe is not near to any sensual position and awakes feeling the explosion of an ejaculation starting...it is still early morning and he starts thinking of her last name and the song she inspired and even her little brother playing hockey in moscow and how in her time zone it would still be dark three hours earlier...there is a fleeting worry of being used by others as a front for sexual misconduct...yet to exhausthimself in something he cannot possibly control would pointless...futile - - still, the knowledge of that possibility haunts him...

since there was no sleep or not much, he returns to pillow and sheets as if drugged until the late afternoon...

in another dream, he finds a perfume that is as appealing as a girl's bubble gum skin scent and he keeps putting it on then runs into chloe or perhaps one of chloe's characters...department store chloe raises an eyebrow so you are the one that smells like that...he must have grinned unable to respond for being overwhelmed and awakes trying to fix in place all the characters he can recall...he knows some people might have committed his writings in the category of lust over passages involving this actor, and wonders if it was not an attempt at full ejaculation...don't get it wrong he finds her attractive but in a much more platonic manner as happens when one develops a mature, nurturing affection - not that he would not turn down her embrace...

hours later, still not hungry and feeling some sort of daze porsche key porch key jenga olivia guitar what a name notre dame art work already settled before the painting, pain easing away...

pain has to go so he can cut his manuscript to undr six thousand words and retain the possibility of expansion from there...

and the possibilities emerge...alice cohen song in mind, before that white zombie, before that springsteen which he distrusts when it goes on and on and so squeezed in tomorrow never knows...

eggs naomi marlene in his mind's eye...

he then attempts this writing which is no worry at all for being foreign to any type of try at literature indeed it's only talking to himself in the constant escape into the page which has long been his habit...

his occupation. his aha initials hassan i sabbah - nothing is true everything is permitted -

hi, s. ah, pook book look took duke fluke puke nuke juke box jew dresden news right far but he sees how much blood seeped into that ground for it not to make a sound indeed alike that apartment home which was more than HIS yes it was many of him more than he count or even recount -

berlin wall kristal night - he had this dream two perhaps three days ago gone - at some crowded counter yet friendly that nearness as in a group where then he swang out nearly as if swimming of course he can't really swim but there is this woman and it is as if we were in love the type of love that need not speak itself and how at ease he was in her arms in her language which is something possibly many don't understand about him or even others, one might know a few languages yet there is only one that is or can be right within that is the language not of love but of the mind -

in that elsewhere moment so divine he awoke feeling the full weird weight of his sorrows and stopped before doing much else even reading as ku/cloakroom tried to evade detection...mailer was on firing line along with a mostly silent vonnegut and i wonder if that was the genesis of his harlot, buckley's wit goes well beyond language as i have know witnessed in two im[ossible demonstration here he pointed to a quote mailer happened to paraphrase as if all the books he ever read were right at his fingertips...the other was with a blind scribe and that 'asomo' for hover he gently proposed...but any way yes, mailer must have considered him heavily to even employ the term crypto nazi and even burroughs for bill's idea that one does not really know if one is alive or dead appears fleshed out in an earlier section...to which burroughs seems to have responded by lifting from the previous book ancient evenings that is to say the postulation of seven souls...in any case, to return to trifle dreams after seeing a swede angel warrior goddess must be like heroin withdrawal hell even the pain tripled itself was it the health scare of the man that used to be?

hemoglobin and suddenlyeven dreaming is improved...released from hospital and back to sciatica....hmm...he refrains from the jokes that arose in his imagination for the sake of decorum funny as they were...

the fried chicken sat next to several croissants and someone suggested a merger, he had never heard anything so barbaric, might as well advocate genocide well on second thought genocide would benefit the world...yes, preferable to syuffing french pastry with the meat of a hen...hehehe...

the daze settled like he had been drugged by some heavy inertia...trapped as it were in non-illuminated realm, the darkness plain idiocy the type that only eats and shits and maybe even shits again...not a second of inspiration for music or writing not even a fraction of a second...does someone other invade and then proceed to evade all manner of desire?

the nun stood near the scene where he had now several days missed any chance to speak to last four digits...belen, he explained the bracelet and ran back home to have her fix it...the nineteenth...he wrote down the numbers although she told him she had no phone...handed her some money and then the sexual experience palyed itself out as he sauntered down to the supermarket to prevent anybody else from putting chickens in their croissants...later that day he found valentina had got a second tattoo, praying hands holding a rosary on her forearm...he liked it although a bit drastic...he was happy that she had at long last posted and let the night slip away into two naps each awaking only an hour or two after having started...startled by a recent dream, he avoided writing it down...the cat with yellow eyes looked up at him, the grey cat did not look...felines are a far better cry than rodents..regardless, after listening to the death dwarf selection from nova express he was certain there had not ever been writing as good anywhere even if the word decorticated grated on his poetic senses...downstairs it is always the same that despair speaking to itself as the mindless mob attempts to climb upstairs...he is up there, with a real clear outline of the script still he can't stop certain distractions.

disintoxication,,,you will be disintoxicated...at every turn the high turns to a low or even a new low...

newl lewk word what was it he was going to write with such feeling now fading in the face of arrogance speaking honking cars loud speakers little encounters internet hijackers oh still this won't go away not this one with its bloodied belly like a scene caravaggio should have painted would have painted...pictures he must have said something they liked those old farts, there he was ginsberg as an elderly man one eye dilated like a sun at eclipse and the other as it was or as hr remembers yes he remembers the squint like gaze of his face gentle yet worn out by fame and contradictions...he got to see him once as he read some poetry still a child or perhaps we should say childlike caught up in the moment and not its importance yet no matter he wondered knowing the zen nature of that poet and at the same time unsettled by the matter of a possible possession from his point of view in the dream he had become burroughs or some part of him that could reach out into outer space heaven junk ship and jive a bit with the man that wrote howl...he awoke at two in the morning after being disturbed by the buzzer like a buzzard pecking at tranquility for he has been expecting a package like a man in the desert waits for rain sure it will cure his thirst...bursting out of a dream the characters wa;lk the streets he grins never having met them and possibly never going to well in fact one hardly meets anyone here except folks struggling to take advanteg of a given situation...strange to blame a bystander instead of the politicians yet that is exactly how it happens he smiles that they are not like that in bolivia or chile or hong kong...the news kills the impeachment hearing hills capitol what is that sound the crazed grunt of a dog, he pays no mind two forty five however picks up finest rock smooth white in order to stun three dogs attempting to tear apart a cat a kitten in a likelihood mood doom they scatter at the stone's thump hump he had not ever wanted to kill a dog previously except in jest but now he would have and he was gl;ad many folks still ate those squirmy senseless animals in the east...east of eden then of course reflecting that somecanines are family to many but what a meal certain aunts would make...ahem...fearing a feral trap he held back from nearing the cat which now dying stretched out on the asphalt had nothing on its side except perhaps his prayrful gaze...of course the last time he tried to help such a creature although not in such drastic conditions there was an air of weirdness as if a set up were in place awating his exit entry which he felt physically yet would be hard presssed to prove like a democrat claiming his or her affection for the ukraine...the cat after a moment twitched the paw not pressed to the surface of the street its stomach tomato red where white had been and its black freckled head in a slow motion shiver as if unable to believe the body could not respond to mentall comands doris he reflected awaking yet still in a slumber seeing and hearing everything yet her limbs unresponsive or his own moment with hamburger hernia when legs lost all power and he crawled from the sony triniton to the phone to call someone but he had nobody to call in any case the cat leaned back and settled in for another moment it looked to feel itself breathing to see if it was still alive and he moved from the salvation throw attempt position to a bedroom window and here after a minute it really started to startle him as it scratched the thin air as if again tryng to escape this fat or maybe even signaling to him as he pondered how the cat was considered sacred in ancient egypt and is  arguably the nearest we have to any sense of goddess or divinity....he looked away imagining the spirit rising away and joining the feline jungle heaven somewhere far from here but it wasn't until well past three that the time of death can be recorded..

in the film he had just seen the husband asked how did the child die and the wife replies instantly during the bombing...let's call the cat michael even if it took him nearly an hour of suffering to surrender to the afterlife...nine lives, except when there are three dogs...later he concerned himself overmuch with a vehicle running over the corpse snd rushed to see at the sound yet somehow it seemed michael was spared this indignity and at dawn's light someone seems to have disposed of the body unless it became a wheel's adornment or as one of his memories spoke to him it had ascended fur and all you see as a youngster he had killed a lizard and was admonished by his grandmother who then perched the lizard at the balcony by the mandarin tree and brought him there the following morning to demonstrate something about nature or reincarnation or the holy nature of even a lizard indeed the lizard was gone and michael was gone neither one could he fully explain...for in fact they are not really gone not inhis mind's eye - years later he came to own a couple of those crawlers which he fed crickets and strangely it was his grandmother's daughter which left the duo  out to freeze during winter...whatever, poor cat...i can't even...where was i yes a high ringing insanity brought on via spanish talk and having seen the joker which is nothing less than its own zeitgeist...imagine even protesters are drssed up like the comic book character...it's a scene in the way that cinema used to be when it was new and filled the imaginations of nations the world over...the sound of the gun shots during the talk show so realistic they echo as if some sort of real kill...evil thrill, he smiled at his own wickedness...hollywood fueds imagine that - magic that - can't get his hair right hat...of course to really get the thrill one needs to view you were never really here before handing over the keys to psychosis to the joker...point blank cop kills masked man in hong kong it could have been his own son one reckons...few hours of sleep, several thoughts over the last four digits, spiritual relationships and fidelity...infidels so quiet it was so quiet before the violence of those animals...like an animation he cannot unsee escape...plastic cloud colored suv pulled out of nearby driveway at the unusual time pre dawn and he thought oh dear what if they played this out only to bring me down in more ways than one...note the rare event of a pack of wild dogs in the middle of suburbia night...once in a blue moon one might get a glimpse of one but otherwise...suspicion holds ground back to the beatniks as burroughs said the paranoid is the one in possession of all the facts...

fast the day like a disturbance dances away it is nearly twelve hours since the assassination slash set up yes he cursed the dogs but he should return and cast one worse over possible manipulators as in retrospect they did seemed trained to attack and none but the guilty flee at the simple drop of a rock as it could have been their own push and pull gnaw scratching that set something loose on the earth - that is they knew they were tearing apart an angel and did so until the loud silence was broken...he wonders if he should have sat back and perhaps they would have been done quicker - an easier passing, however no way to go back and know...what he does know is that it looked like some sort of rape yet what in fact did fuel such a fire?

all the while knowing he his prepared to write yet his instinct refuses to agree and all this might take yet another while to let go.

real beauty in a dream well a nap as he got up in the early hours after midnight - angela k -  he thought perhaps through valentina - video memory that inspired some writing - writhing now after once upon a time in hollywood - touggh one to get a grip on - groove after dream returned three consecutive nightmares which he refuses to re-tell for the characters don't appeal to him heavy walking three lap dogs catching the breeze rolled by anacaona as he made his way to the other house under the bridge a kitten lay as if asleep yet gone and he'd never been quicker at the visit - returning to organize and pizza - slow mining day the man the news spoke of looked just like wimpy from popeye...somewhere along the line his own left eye irritated possibly dust or magnets he could not be certain...cigarette run, bianca crowded - the music cruising through the distractions until those legs - and suddenly nearing ten, he feels it is much later and it is in lonndon and beyond...beijing tomorrow morning...in the porno clip amature finger size glass stick sliding in for squirts she kept talking - one might say the right tool for the job; look here boys no need for lip hand or cock et cetera...a rexona section note he imagines...but only so far as the pain creeps in again ironic as a knife in the hip...they say location is everything but that was too close for comfort...confusion not so much, chaos less. by this he meant something about his new novel and that particular section...session problem one he was certain the mentioned film came after the fact and made his mind turn weird then was it comedy or drama well alright life except with an edited ending...just the facts ma'am...no, everything save ramming through the fourth wall...call me strange but the bruce lee scene well i believe he would have liked it that is to say obvious =ly all the kung fu speed talent in the world cannot stop a bullet from being shot. hot through the flesh walls of my dreams walk the strangers posing as family and i don't know them if i ever did. and so the paragraph turns to protest, maybe it's only procrastination. he settles the list to do [ cleaning - harlot's ghost - writing - music - and planning escape methods for the impending assault from relatives visiting]

oh babe it ain't no lie this life i lead is mighty high...

somehow all done and satisfaction even if orgiastic he settled into a second dream state after not really having much of a scene in the tired and tempting night...

it's suburbia, the type of road one finds in michigan well outside of detroit perhaps also the northwest....mounbtains, he is thinking of sliding in to the gymansium of what seems to be a school or college, the dream circles back and there is the road once more and the same thought except this time he goes in shadowed by a group of men which he can hear as they converse...within the bathroom he finds a blonde woman purse poured out in front of the bright mirrors, turns to him saying she has been raped and he asks is he should call the authorities she says there is no signal in here as he checks his phone which corroborates the presumption meanwhile the men enter and one of them nears him suggestively offering an encounter and lightly glazed the side of his face with fingertips - he is not surprised in the dream turning him down and giving up on the idea of a shower...she, the blonde - it seems - has turned into a little girl, waist high and one arm outstretched but it is through his pant's zipper, that is the bicep is caught between the open zipper andthe arm is seemingly saluting...not strange enough to distract from the growing horde, a crowd chanting white power, white power, white power....he does not feel out of place for some reason, well perhaps because in school he was called the white boy...no problem with political view points or positions he considers as the real corruption only comes in when anything is suppressed...what does it matter in the end if someone doesn't take a liking to spanish or french people? yes, as long as they don't rape women in paris or buenos aires....in anycase, the girl slash woman has woman has joind the crowd a his pants feel fine yet wondering if it was a so-called minority that got to that woman, so easy now in a club with gangster beats thumping that get down chorus, sure sure if you didn't want it why were you grinding on the dance floor....no escape. .. he is now pressed in by the mob unsure if they see him as leader or outsider and from the outside a dark haired woman with bright eyes glides in and escorts him out into safety as he peers at waht seeems to be someone rifling through his passport, the one he carries which is well worn the awakes as nine oclock nears. no call yet from the invasion squad, it was said they'd be in at eight...he put an extra lock on the doorto avoid attempts at surprise, naked sleeping loses its charm when having to greet family members - well a few more touches and the practice of well i really couldn't get much cleaning done not with this sciatica and such...as you know, the best intentions...a strawberry plant, for example dead before the second day oh dear he hopes it will spring back but it already looks chewed...

retrospect thought woman girl possibly a nazi salute or the third reich salute which in xome circles has been employed by so called supremacists of course if one goes by logic it is a misplaced association since hitler and co were more about purity than anything else with the exception of technology...well another type of chewing one might say - that is to say the evaluation with logic after all the propaganda and posturing is simply impossible in that if one were to take a stand for some of the virtues of the axis people would in general or en masse be befuddled despite the fact that many of them adore the pure breed fact of their dogs and cats...to give one example.

as ten nears he reconsiders the theroy theory that he was put on in order to see how much he would cleand or could clean cloud of suspicion well, weirder things have happened. like he mentioned, judgement is a kick a lot of folks can't get enough of.

what is it to him, surely here and there he judges at least who should get on a treadmill and shed a few dozen pounds on the nonsense sounds being passed off as hits in the age of free download libraries....he shudders to think two skinny girls the actual last rock stars....now then, a better question how to balance being a musician, artist, writer....the triple front of himself in various fonts...after ten not yet here or heard of but already intruding upon imagination...perhaps some high grade alcohol which he has been avoiding in honor of his swede divinity...something to put the lights out and let the darkness harken into heaven's work. he decides suddenly to struggle through it with harlot's ghost until further notice. post- script, michael j pollard was eighty and still looked like very much like the kid he played in bonnie and clyde...the line came to him without sadness after the obituary a tattoo why'd you want to do a fool thing like that....well then there, to be constant there's nothing like it he paraphrases a great german writer.

writer dreams of gerzack as if not a day has passed since "meeting" her...the love feeling lovely as they float about each other - seems to be manhattan inside some sort of shop where little kids impishly pry into his hair with some sort of glue...chase in vain then outside where it seems to be central park west = he's lost sight of her and saunters one way then turns in another direction following some other women - awoke early feeling fine save for the nag upon leg, ibuprofen coffee camel into fantasy sex before the dream...brooke's friend's line enters mind, i know you - we walked together in a dream...ian hunter song in my head's sweet groove...move to walk aunt's house delivery water sweep exit...his mother takes up a lot of time not exactly being herself and still putting an accent on the dust he didn't vanish when cleaning...levels of clean, he is sure she will rise from the grave to sweep up the cemetary...so many things so little time, a perfume named after a city theme michigan awesome package, not to mention cheap...shots before thanksgiving with hints of others, strangers, stranded himself for re-playing films for her...phone work tone no internet yet the deal said one year free...fine, line of work anyelina ten to eight, i ask the last four digits if he should leave the chewing gum with her co worker and she tells me to bring it  when he retunrs early...no rerun day, it's all going easier than i expected save for that bizarre tv plus two men against logic going for a nap as i tried to avoid them ahem...some people adore the mix or even the mixup while he stands firm on some sort individuality...i am not a witch the nightingale tracks...she keeps saying i saw this or started to see this in new york...pisses me off, possessed i suspect by perveted men...no way to stop it however he seems to have found a way to save the orange tree she kept harping on  cutting down,,,,these inconsequential arguments waste the minutes and make the hours stretch into each other...selena got the same valentina tattoo forearm on her thigh...one could sigh, or if one is so inclined clean most of the day to  clean again another day...james bond title spoof clean another day...i say old sport, this martini glass looks a bit dusty to me...

bartender spits in the glass and hands it back after a swift swab with his belt rag -

thirty six belt will need a new hole goal chinese coal - james grabs the bottle before he can shake the not stirred libation and swallows a gulp before departing into the crowd of downtown streets...there's a tired feeling like an agent that has seen it all or perhaps too much, still he has enough patiaence or wisdom to respond to the last four digits when there is no choice in area code, well whatever you say is fine, you see i've learned not argue with women as they are often stronger more resourcfeul and persistent and i don't have enoug adjectives in this language, he sighed suddenl;y excited by his own glibness in a tongue he never actually studied... stu dying - stu died, call from the newspaper a subscription at triple cost he turns down the price as well as the exclusive concert yet later reflects he may not have another chance at this merengue as happened with sinatra and those ballads...well, some cook some do not cook...concerts are all well and good but the recording is what is pal played and played again...one does not think to dislike the word exhausted until it is repeated several dozen times by the same person...prison of word dust, language virus...in the end the dust he never swept swelled up and seems to have put the final touches on saving her eyes yet not before he had to face down the disarming sentence of how are you still alive in a mess such as - send in the clowns = calling all cars - not uber which is a whatever of whoever wheels - lawyers, guns, and pura lana vergine his reda suit arrived and he proceeded to defend himself with the divine mercy pry prayer at three o'clock after which she herself was turning off the lights - duck talking heads luck and she was hey hey obviously one more coffee sugared and milked  to stay alert for the mayhem is far from over.  

far from ober over uber over and gre gre few dreams scream possessed by vertigo alzheimer fake jesus mother holy spirit lost religion patience one knob door look it's two oh well the scissors then again the spoons so let's cut down all the plants belkis and daughter tag team behind the back no water match haTCH bew new plants yet the enthusiasm for these things is gone thinking of it or on it too similar to an escapade from above imagine that neighbors so intent on control they lurk in the shadows to shake up the natural order of rings he sings sadly dont you love her madly well here we are across the street dream of the blonde now brunette...not certain what it means inka quoted remembered dreams as messages...bali, bail, hail what a fail to look upon the remaining stumps of orange and palm trees upon the balcony...truth is too much for some and so he was disinvited from thanksgiving dinner by way of we are going to invite assholes, selfish fat assholes but it's a big apartemtn so you won't have to deal with them ahem - respect and everything else is far from what it used to be - in any case his mother - it seems - argues for the sake of denying a failure within herself - it often entrances his day and nothing gets done except the very limited basics - blast of housewife echo - who invented such idiocy - slavery for women worldwide...and when the women break down well let the kids do the juggling...this one and that one continuallly trying to tie him up in simplified "english+expanded spanish" what pain how insane, the blonde woman bought a battery - made him wonder while trying to avoid over-venting in the writing of these notes - new shirt bleached sleeve and some of the front, for the sake of curtains...he can see more of the street from the porch now and it does not sit well with him...no matter, he planted tomatoes, cucumbers, and another lemon tree...still neither expectation not desire for planting slash gardening is there...sitting through the replay of films for the sake entartaining his mother, time goes by and does not return...he finds pictures of the last four digits, realizes how superior the ones he took of her are yet the fact of her distance is making the romantic aspect vanish...he's low on sugar and short on time for the deadlines whichare nigh...witch aria, circle sir madam hitched to a pause in the action of his own life...he is dismayed by the lack of any visible visible progress around him and awakes to a monetary discussion where instead a grant and or donations could be...blindness is more than one thing, he is short sighted but his ambitions and goals are clear as a cloudless sky...too bad, the insanity is surrounding the enviormnent alike the judgement which always seems misplaced...miss place race piss his face lace swiss - and like that there goes novemeber with more regret than expected.

it's a good thing, he ain't heavy on either side of the proverbial fence.

Tense preserve jhe serves himself some sort of dream after waiting throuhj his own desires...school type lunch picnic table no cloth blonde writes her name in the fashion of anyelina script he said block letters latong laying there it is datalynn or something speaking of anagram awe which sometimes is not or even nothing between the beauty legs all the while thinking the last four digits who disappears and returns...meanwhile mother a bit more lije like herself yet still willing to fight over any trivial matter as if it mattered...dream fihhting off sisters ex husband then walking to the building where gates have gone down turning back in time to store corner meeting mither mother mutter utter this away we go waking watch some suspiria ending in arguments...what tits...he sits and smokes...the best day ever because he communicated with a woman he admires...why should one lie -it rests me- echoes of heroin, yet neighter hugh high nor excited a flash of chinese muse that did not call belated news albania duress stress bless me for he said it plain true the lird lord does not clean...six feet under bones worm...steady he stays, smiles theough thru weird pizza tears enjoying his pie and now thinking not once does she consider the possiblefeeling of desolation...whatever, he jumped for joy after the discourse determined to wait a day in order to savour the sensation...it was right on the gee heels of shadows and fog where jodie licked woodys nipple...triple time told in black and white...

Tired niw now despite two baps  app naps -

16 may 11 59pm

last minute of the day, sugar table at long last cleaned, strange dreams into a quiet day...as i noticed a possible leak i worried over intrusion as i cleaned the house despite being positively low on cleaning fluid...

a banana three cupcakes three eggs a potato and some bacon comprised the meal later adorned by juice...

i made six pieces for maria, perhaps improving on the drawing...then three more with her friend elizaveta which actually led to a total of twelve as i discovered another image i wanted or,wished to include...

the drawing did sort of match, in a faraway sense not that it had to actually resemble merely imply...

both her and lisa seemed pretty happy in their beauty today...

i read the viy yet i didnot like the audiobook voice as it sounded emotionless, robotic...

i had downloaded the selected or complete,works but as it came to mind i went with the recording...

now i know the story, yet cannot claim surprise as i listened to the near monotone speaking...

later i crafted some further images of self as well as for lauren as the notion of her misunderstanding struggled at my sense of fairness...

i had intended to conclude viewing faust 2011 yet the reel only partly played to ask for, payment...

it is rather intense, the line can you walk haunted me even as i escaped into fantasy for being the same words a woman doctor mentioned in asking had said after i had been on her emergency "rack" for a while only to be turned down for treatment...2010...

well only ten years late to the premier...

beware some unkind types will use phrases including that amount of years or even more as lure to trap et cetera...

virus is a language, mine land..language the virus land mine exploding minutes gone months missing whatever...

i go to bed nine to sleep yet twelve sleepless...

somehow i am unconcerned, painted my left hand nails, my thoughts actually feel poetic even if i did not feel like putting work into the domain yet ruffled by the wrecking ball memory of saturday.

17 may

i got up dreaming someone was trying to interview the duchess, yet sort of a rude man i sensed...eight oclock...maria in my thoughts yet in few minutes it seemed the dreadful fat old neighbor swarmed into my imagination...

some folks you wish you never even heard of...

there was a minute yet right before the dread, that found me in some sort of supermarket stance, not even the shop i like, my inclination to pull away tempered by the fact that i am friendly with several woman workers and who the hell knows if one of them needed whatever...

problem with nacional is once in a while they want to get into your intimate business as if they were partners in profit...not to mention their recent strategy to hold smokes as if someone were stealing them...so i am weary of that plus previous,experiences meaning it is used as an entry point when the apartment is empty...or used to be...

imagine it the only profitable shop in the mall plagued by its own disrespect as well as possible alibi excuse for invaders...

yes i realize it sounds paranoid, but it is not, it is nothing but facts save for the profit as a bank or two might also be raking it in at the atm or such...

but i do not want to waste more time not even in proving the point.

the guard across the street kept walking to the corner, i noticed twice...

i watered the plants, i cleaned up the kitchen, i switched some curtains...

in the rising heat some sort of anxiety fixed me into weirdness although i was terribly happy that alexandra was yet in school...that naya was downright poetic...that i created two further gifs for ello...weather woman and the diplomat wife slapping a sales girl...that i captured an exact idea when out of the blue maria referenced her yesterday post...once in the while the multi layered glitch maker does not execute for varying dimensions or other factors...

in reading selected news items, i agreed woth nobody in particular that maria does well at least her hair resemble paulina...

paulina perhaps my favorite hands casasnova...

writing this cooking rice with the memory of fear at her being involved in the new york city insanity...they say he killed two men and gave us a cooking pot which i threw out far from the reach of associations with her...

strange to protect someone, even to the point of losing their remembrance...

i hope it was worthwhile...i must have been trained in previous lives to live as if all life had been a distant blurry dream in order to avoid the mix up...

one cannot learn these actions in one life span...

it only hurts to have returned here to be treated once in a while as if indeed the past good was erased, deleted...

still, my only true concern was that lisa had not posted...

she now has and i hear the meat sizzle...

nine ten evening, 

a quick view of tarzans revenge 1938 - trippy...

monkey telepaphy...

money tell, the old pundi 1500 plus was updated to 1.6 something...a thousand to one...well, at least it is there and now wallet settled...a bit of other coins there currently valued at about thirty dollars.

at chz i got my second token, goztepe sk...

but nearly all coins are suffering as bitcoin dropped back to months ago prices...

worst part is seeing a miner go from eight dollars to six so as to make the mining appear to be going in the opposite direction...

created new for odeya, removing the pleasure machines post on a suspicion that said it was a sore point for her...or could be...

the awesome line came to me later: it is art and art is not supposed to be pleasurable...

i gather my most daring move was the dog humping one...it was in response to learning of those unsettling porn clips as if to protest decidedly in drastic fashion which would or should out-shock those intentions...hmm short circuit them, if you will...

that not odeya, but impossibly the duchess...

yes, i thought exactly i will not be knighted yet i have been honest in defending her and my strange integrity...

today she posted a new video from the hold still series...forever holding hands...

pretty neat yet i actually think they pay heed to critics that mentioned the cuteness was overdone in an earlier one and now it is as bland however emotional as the reviewers...

i really loved the earlier one, with the visuals as if children or faeries had been involved...

a productive day it seems plus got faust yet with subtitle synch a few seconds out...

not at all fw murnau yet a different type of brilliant outside the box of the book...

macarthur must have been related to goethe for having such mind power into his eighties...

speaking of years it took me years to settle into that play...i seem to recall attempting to read it alongside the satanic bible...i guess some things are preset for a specific position of time...

meanwhile, it looks as if i am running out of water...which had not occurred in a while...

i can only hope, there will be water again soon to fill that tank which is waiting for its backup tank so as to not encounter this situation again.

what a long, convoluted, and tragic tale that would be to say into someones ear in one sitting...it would in fact be unbelievable albeit nonetheless true.

presently to spare this journal them details.

presently to sleep. ps, someone used the doors song the end in a video hawking their retail goods...i was astounded at the true recollection of jim's feeling on the subject of commercials, telling her about in as polite a manner as i could given my surprise...stronger than dirt...i really enjoyed expanding the knowledge base of someone that might simply not have known...the only line that could follow is zeppelin led : i am a traveler of both time and space to be where i have been...

18 may,

i got up feeling it was late, excited except the sensation felt as if it were from i the vg...

all the weird wonderings wandered then even as i poured my pee from erection hoping the aim would be well served unlike the pounding thoughts...

it continued, i could even see her...nearly feel her...yet why and  for what reason...

i chalked it up to someone's manipulation...

a few hours before, my beloved maria had posted yet again but i can hardly artistry upon waking still i did three one of which might be something to look at...

feeling the failure and limitations of self in conjuction with the girl that came to town yet far from my near inspiration not to mention the worry over water, i started my day...

startled at the irish girl in seduction and some other overdose like a needle going into my veins as if they were a coup against my love palace...

darwins arch drowned, dw reported...

i gave up trying to find meaning, trying to wait for the correct time...

at least the water returned...for now...

checking to make certain all faucets were tight, i brushed my teeth with a feeling of relief quickly overwhelmed by the fact that it is not only documents and recordings in the hp but passwords...still, nothing at specific label but imagine how horrific if one were celebrity famous and had to have one's laptop at the mercy of repair...

i think i need to play some drastic songs.

might record to see how the new strings translate to tape.

210 not datsun

cleaning supplies and cigarettes a plan to make pasta...

btw i know some of these first world problems are trivial in relation to war ravaged situations yet as a borderline egomaniac what us one to do?

the loudest truck in the history of trucks stationed itself in front of the building with its shrieking,rib shaking noise...water company?

yes they were blue hosing the street holes...

i was frightened and turned off my laptop...

site updated with three muse portrait and roadhouse blues...wichtelhohlen...still hard to spell...

bread breakfast...alina out of the blue...

social media seriously harms your mental health...quote of the era...

further out is a cub from incest...

pandemic animal sperm mix up...

bear, so-bear...germans are blaming the russians...

i should of think of sveta yet i am much too into my present now...

first, the film, then the spaghetti...

946pm

pasta interrupted by call from aunt...i even gave her some...forgot the cheese though in the hurly burly...

in any case, looking over the viy, i can now say that the rendering in that audiobook was not only off but criminal...

there is a feeling at simply gazing at the words, sentence structure...it is not poetic yet it is a poem.

otherwise, faust, 2011, yes another poem but darker despite having no demon witch or gnome...a sight to behold, frightening in ways that make one doubt it is the same director as russian ark yet they say it is part of a set of films with moloch theme and i have not seen the others...

i loved the illumination of faces when she enters his room...at times only eyes would be visible...as if the sunlight was breathing...

the actress was well cast in that role...

speaking of actress, drew barrymore and the word gaslit and the name woody allen as if to sell books by her and his deluded accuser...

the reference to 1996 gave me a chance to letterman briefly and bazaar in which she even claimed to take a role in a low budget b film as a trade off to get everybody says i love you...

a cinema classic, i found a twice told interview wherein she praised the production...even dropped the names in positive recognition of the music director and the costume designer...

still i feel as if i have lost a friend in ms barrymore or perhaps she was only teasing me earlier in barefoot strolling hint..i used to think she was so beautiful but these blurbs have blunted my once upon a time crush...

i posted it at the realm twitter, which i have mostly given up and took a few turns in protest...as it is a danger or actually it leads to a mob mentality which seems to blind the hoi polloi into a lynching frenzy...

with some types, it is easy...he is sure one even if he werent a jew but as the state kills off more palestinian families well...easy conclusions arrive...

duke william i suspected was another, but my suspicion was verified at the we are not racist reaction like he was some punk they could just turn out for a trending amusement...

he simply has not settled into a role well suited enough for his type...his type which has long been changing from eligible wanted and desired bachelor to part married man part military man (all the while beneath some sort of diana spell...) neither of which it seems caught the attention of the public as proved by the unfriendly tweets...at least i think it is so you in america and being that that is where the world opinion films are produced...well you see the point...

football, seems to be his field yet that remains to be secured...possibly as time goes by, it will feel more natural, more like a tradition but by then the spotlight might not even be on him as much as his offspring...

of course not everybody can be a star.

well, they sure think they can as social media proves...fifteen minutes, thankfully andy warhol was wrong.

19 may 10 23pm

got up early yet stayed on in bed for an hour or so contemplating muses and worrying over audible thoughts or visual mental projections into wrong places...

before long it was noon...bread and the pasta seemed to have cured aunt...

mother at long last read the cloak...loving it as i suspected she would...

in the love me two times stance i crystal shipped from roadhouse...

i niamh bit at ello...

i thought "finnegans woke at minority run past racial profiling drone circuits to come...

still weighing...

another look at lauren, steak and potatoes still full...

the wild angels seemed to partly predict laura's countenance or perhaps this was reflected to me somehow...

after some hours i finally responded to a suspicious comment with three quotes and perhaps blunt yet truthful concern...

in the process learning who wroted beauty is in the eye of the beholder...

which i have already misplaced in memory which returns some batty fragment of a womans name...

i swear wren elaine was viewing that biker film with me...

lap in five, slap in zombie i saw before the final words charles manson but really buddy day who postulated in precise hints that a gangster  was holding one of the women thus hell broke loose at cm shooting him and bringing in the straight satans mc...

note sharon anagram: tate hangs star as him, or so...

weird, no? 

meaning all the other murders were to cover as covert actions but the repeating point of the film lied for in fact he did not see the negro as endgame even quit a production that wanted to go jesus dark...

also note family not interracial...

still a travesty of a trial played out and predicted in the press long before verdict...

veni vidi vici or everybody is working for some spy agency or other...

government 14 words check might be soon...

song line came to mind "sveta and me caint get no government zombie check..."

hopefully she got hers too...

every time i quote myself it feels unusual...

alina again came up this time as if mirroring my food fight...by that i mean the yelling nearby before getting to meal...

as if to make you think of something beyond your pleasure...

like a shootout in holland...

finally i skim raced through one of the resident alien films having also browsed several of the trailers not wanting to waste further minutes viewing it only enough to gain an entry point into a poster i intend to make for the offered incentive of a prize...

meanwhile i removed yesterday's tweets in order to see how the theory of asian world domination sounded, i heard it nearly,as if true...the yuan is digital but will not reach the top hundred given that bitcoin and a few others have the market cornered, had?

in their attack of crypto speculation as well as in the reports there is no mention of their heavy investment within their new digital national currency...

the lady doth pro-test for position...

it seems a mess, but it did get me an early gain of a little zec at one faucet...

anyway, it finally felt good and right to be in this day and age as the duchess visited the v and a museum with a striking elegance that even left me stunned...i say so as her tall dignified sway and gentle swagger implied a power very few women have been able to hold, perhaps only a handful yet most if not all of these had not been subject to immediate translations in media photographs and articles...there was a glimpse at the funeral yet here she has surpassed all expectations, obviously. 

midnight 23 may 2021

anise seeded rice 

meat peppered

a bitter butterfly and skull tattoo

nineteen twenty five

man woman or teen there aint

not one easy video documentary

pola negri

well throw your poland hips

upon rudolph valentino casket

even once as in enough for ever

an army follows then i met calla walsh

not knowing rifkins festival had been

long before released with two sharp

jabs and killer weirdness as if my

partner were reluctant to give much

more than the mere enough 

while tying up loose ends and reminding

movie houses that he is always cinema

i viewed it with pasta having awoken to 

unholy chess voice echo of a move as if

someone had twisted my neck meaning no dream again after entertaining the notion of mother arriving and sister sitting me down with a pig mouthed man 

nightmares...it seems some folks fear not incest within coexistence as long as they can get their kicks...

later nearly haunted by another dream which appeared to predict lisa and her cheesecake...

a couple of distinctly different slices of cake, one with frosty lettering which sister squeezed like sponge as if to not let anyone have it then an uncle sauntering in the background perhaps for his wife's name coinciding with part of my muse trio maria...

me i always worry but at least today i watched while jane gained herself a long key sibling...

so happy i didnt start planning for airplane tickets as the announced check was only a courtesy notification...

yet the duchess speeds to scotland, land of university and recent elections...

land of 1606 folio...yes, nothing else was written that whole year...

say or see at the lead role on stage soon...

i celebrate with two portraits at instagram and vsco

how could i handle any more excitement...

a second song track for lauren or from lauren done

hexen eurorack synthesizer paid 

day passing as if trying for a speeding ticket

i make love in the unlocked cars of lust

lady diana even crossed my street mind

the news was telling of inter tangle view

yet my inclination is that she should have not

those knots of infidelity untied...

some people it is unfortunately true are too nice...

paved with good intentions, nice guys finish -

in trying for some type of prose poem i find

i want to shave, face, not words...

it is awful trying to write and edit

even if i did appear to be fluent enough to adjust from movie poster to fictional corporate propaganda after studying the guidelines

not this but that oh all right here goes...

the title is resident evil welcome to racoon city

and if selected then i can possibly rekindle my longing to get airline tickets...

tik toks a neat enough getaway for now...

greasy thoughts again of immigration as italy sent back invaders...

it is as i postulated, public school kids barging into a private school all for the sake of taking part in that luxury, taking a part of it...

juxtaposed with one's house is where i believe most people will get the basic intrusive nature of the situation...

someone shows up at your door and suddenly moves in demanding a place at the table, but not to visit no it it is to stay and the someone might actually be several as in the mentioned case over six thousand of them...

europe is nearly still a nice house, a nice school yet how long can it last?

of course i am not writing this for that 

i am or i was wanting to impossible as a jewish palestine treaty to hope as if praying for the safety of the aforementioned trip...

all that gossip and all that discourse of recent headlines and or articles compounded by previous constant contrasting at beloved princess well you see the conundrum...

it is as heavy as the current coin situation...

yet in making the contrast i recall that there were several awards of possible true and high value via socios amen women or teen yay i said...so perhaps she will also rise above the pulling into history repeats its wealth...

however the facts are not with mother and even aunt now reflects that type of drowsy mind thought thinking as she telephoned like one not aware of having pressed the numbers and i responded only to hear her rasp in casual desperation to herself unaware of connection that she could not find one of her son's contact information...

i doubt even any poverty could be worse than losing one's memory...and with it self identity, love itself narrowed to a pet or the confounded few that surround that decay...

i am unhappy to report that i have next to no patience for these baffling instances...

and i fear its contagion more so than other types of infection...

having experienced its very hollow nature in those moments when at ease some lapse will leave you wondering how we are two places at once...

ah yet once in a while it is not in the bad or worser sense as in a tag line from one of the irish emerald's film...

my body was here but my soul was with you, i paraphrase...

indeed this has felt most true, with aleksandra as some sort of ceremony neared then transpired it was as if we though diminished by circumstance no less alluring myself the fool for her and yes even the woman that made her...what would naya say! 

never having actually parachuted, or wanting to, yet the words tumble down into the  ejaculated drip of this note landing only to learn that there is another stretch of road ahead.

434 23 may 

dream of intense, vivid scenes interconnected nearly as logical yet action drama film...

someone is discovered to have some covert what do they call it, counter agent...double agent, well yes and when divulged the leader is murdered seemingly shot through the back then arms extended in that crucified way except not upright but floating horizontal near my character in the dream which seems to then be chased in having this information running down a mid west sort of american town wherein a voice can be heard threatening along the avenue littered with those large mouthed green cannisters and revolving ground drones which appear to flash as they near in proximity...the technology i think as i see an amputated horses head and the counter agent take aim with a small bazooka type weapon, i continue running yet it is not me that character, it is like a message i cannot decipher...i get up thinking that the new track was timed in rhyme with the minutes of that hour as it  was here later 34...

christina and maria came to mind...nearly as if i had been with them, then i thought about the laptop, not the one delayed in fixing, but the expensive  alienware i am attracted to, then given the subject matter i thought of gina...

which sometimes leads to hoyt but not here as i searched to look for update or new post from some girls i noticed i the vg...that i didnt want to notice for reasons already explained, after pour ing some cooled coffee and a smoke exhaling and writing this quick sketch.

809pm 23 may

i dreamt in the dawning hours as if possessed by lisa's vanilla tobacco white candle, a pretty thing with that set of thick matches so fat tgey bring only five in the pack...

the dream was about lilia antonia and how she was getting into clothes not to change but to cover something up, for a moment there was intimacy yet some other voice awoke me as it urged her on in her attire...

as waking brought thought i could see that it was only lisa in some attempt for further attention...

how did i get so lucky in saint p...

it is like a magic town for me now...

sunday it was sunday and i rushed to shop while church was still ongoing in the hopes of avoiding patrol...

always worse on sunday as if trying to recapture a saturday night loss...

mother called speaking of mucus...

i carried on, returning with the goods and subsequently proceeding to not only clean most of the kitchen but to cook and eat and even prewash the dirty laundry...

i was lucky, i listened to the clash instead of the quicksand echo of a bitch that pointed to another cashier as she was done and it was my turn telling me the express line was open to which bewildered i stayed silent...

it felt goodly to have everything in order until a neighbor shouted...

itself taking more time than i wish to recount...

anyway, the four days film was nearly good, i mean you could tell the work of the actors but then as if to ruin the great kid scene and tge flophouse scene oh yeah the ex husband one could or should be mentioned they boneheaded into injection having heard directly of emergency if combined with agency powders...

no way to salvage that, admit defeat and fade out...

my feeling of not wanting to see that due to all the talk of mila resembling odeya well maybe i should trust my instincts more but in megan fox confusion i slipped into nostalgia and plowed through it along with serious grease from the rib eye steak...

ah look a picture of lauren...i have no power against the charms of certain girls...

straight to the collection...

also as if collecting for history dylan and the dead and the one and only catch them before they croke dublin jagger placing my own cover as if to say i know what league you played in of dead man dead man...hmm tarantula here lies bob dylan...i typed out the lyric words this time...

the times have ironically ended the neverending tour...

but knowing bob, there might be more down the line...

rammstein recently announced their return this now years after celebrating their own promotional funeral...

yes, that is to say anything is possible.. 

i am drowsy full, a meat high if you will...

water, cold water never tastes as good as after some salty treat...

or perhaps it was going through a bunch dixie songs propelled by lynyrd skynyrd and trying to escape the nearby weirdness...

i even wanted to jolson sing is it true what they say about swanee...but like al i love to sing...don-t care who makes the nation's laws...

it seems a seven day week gone by and not a minute for guitar save to see how the tuning is holding...

whoa.

428am 24 may

dream of farm, faraway, the farm of once upon a time, as i walk notice crowd, one girl beckons me with such ardor as to make me rush yet in crossing the divide and the spaces i encounter karla well someone that seems to be her...she is with some other girls all dressed in faux late nineteenth century garments gathered at a table reading out a play as 8n rehearsal her dress a burgundy silk and she embraces me yet not having hugged anyone in a while i expect it to be seconds yet the seconds turn to breathing minutes wherein it seems we fall asleep, imagine it dreaming of falling asleep in a dream...when i awake in the dream i am trying to get through the house and walk past a square sparce shower into a metal labrythn as in city fire escapes until trapped but some man pulls away one of the grilled coverings telling me that from there i can take such and such a road to wherever im going except he is not speaking of farm or manhattan but santo domingo which i find strange but so happy to be nearer to the crowd and the girl that i dont pay it a second thought suddenly it is the city and she as if waitress or hostess or some service oriented staff tells me she is working as i near so i waltz around to kill time until the dream setting turns into a circular mallesque hockey rink and above it where i am it is lined with shopping items one might encounter in a type of outlet variety that is bananas next to boxes of tomato paste anyway she is being herded by a wall of men men of varying complexions as i write i see caitlin as possibly being the girl she screams i have been searchibg for you and i reach down and grab her hand urging the men to let go now in cheerleaders uniform i finally near her to me kicking away plastic packs of diapers and securing her under my embrace...i awake then having only a moment of her nearness as i type now to wonder if marie anne is pregnant...

i pour coffee light a smoke decide suddenly to throw out some liquid icy hot and vicks for fear my back and leg pain might return after sister mention her back was killing her...

i never use those things anyway...as i stir sugar into cup i hear the white cat and fix myself to descend with milk it caresses my leg and raises itself against the surface which i selected to balance getting the first part of the parmalat onto the plate...had not seen it stretch in such a manner...looking at it looking at me with a repeated meowing i notice its face us very much like nayas cat...sunblumer, the skies still moonlit...

i wonder if the duchess has arrived in scotland, i wonder what lisa  had for breakfast. 

913pm

i had some passing thought over dates, in research i found masters of war and murder most foul were released on a 27th day...march may...jwh, infidels, and gaibty too...

daniel is the 27th book if the bible...it is rather something to know an artist went beyond measure in a sense to come full circle nearly sixty years on...

i felt some inclination to add one version of the new tracks under kate's nurse video...

i felt good over it but it seems to have gone unnoticed...

made pasta again followed by the to olivia film that centered on a writer and his actress wife losing a child...i cannot say i liked it, i cannot imagine anyone enjoying that much underlining of emotion...also their successes after the incident were difficult to celebrate to say the least...and as shocking as the true story was well there was paul newman coldly responding with it happens as a man devoid of feeling or empathy outside of the script...still it gives one plenty of space to react with above excellent acting and although that would be good it felt weird...

hmm i cannot process deaths beyond bowie, that might be it...perhaps it is extending into film...

free in the evening, i already working for maria...

collected some photographs in case new inspiration arrives by which i mean her posting...

posting from scotland kate did arrive and synchronistically it seemed announced her attempt at music asking for it to be deleted...

pretty cute...the cables reminding me of all the connected wires in the so called racks which i am learning to create upon...

it could lead to paranoia this sort of coincidence yet how cool would it be to have that as some sort of response...

here is where i would lyric winter : You know the gypsy carried me all down on Rampart Street, I seen everybody that I wanted to meet...

go on back to see the gypsy, most underrated of songs...

since here let me trio, nicks, Lightning strikes maybe once, maybe twice and it lights up the night and you see your gypsy...

unusual how thoughts wander from one word now to continue on some other trip before gypsy kings and others settle seep into this page...

such an easier time at the sirena ex pola today...even in the blazing sun i hardly felt bothered on the way back...

you would imagine i was having champange and caviar or something...the way that other place tries to infiltrate...

only thing that made me think twice was a girl in extreme short tight blue jeans and boots appearing neither whore nor female but skyscraper!

where was i ah yeah paranoia, it would be logical if my intent was untrue, if words were taken as opposites or opposition which might happen in the confusion or chaos yet in reasonable circumstances remains illogical.

still one hopes for meaning, but as my partner insists the universe is only expanding and it might all be meaningless...

yet my dear mr fantasy mind so quick chloe came into hallucination as they mentioned writer married to actress...

and yet i did steal one game in a such a crush that crowded a rook and four queens all against the machine until the rare words spilled out, white wins.

ps to clueless conclude outside of chess i  was like totally buggin.

25 may 

although tryin to dream i kept thinking...i suppose, after waking a nap as it was one of those days...in the nap a conversation with mother as if wiretap repeated back into an earphone not actually in my ear yet throbbing...perhaps,a lisa piercing speaking to me at wrong place or time...i got up with intent on take out luckily on sale tuesdays...

i think i fpund my favorite header, its the scene where philip jeffries is walking into a hotel south of the border and his shadows visible in two subsequent glazed windows as a mariachi guitar trio only a couple visible emerge in the foreground...

i was bugged otherwise most of the day as if someone was intent on standing in my place as it were...anyway at twitter after nearly enjoying the irony of an actor trying extra hard for points in the impossible politically correct world i returned to calla so as to not make it seem a one night stand even if platonic intentions were all there was aside from hopefully helping in some fashion then this other other manipulation irked me...sharna walker otherwise lorraine being pulled the nine circles of hateful hell all because she was filmed upset going nigger this and nigger that then expectorating in frustration from a distance...so having the instinct i tried to explain how it could happen easily to anyone simply from hearing rap lyrics, a common word therein in fact in recent porn a similar brunette sucked eagerly as the soundtrack kept repeating it could do this or that all day followed by n word as it is known now in niggerless print...i also proposed the press could refrain from teaching its readers such words and gave an example from experience i have hopefully told in other stories...the kick in the pants though was my impromptu submission to hallmark suggesting a sorry you have been cancelled card for the cancel culture...i did not lnow she had list her job and would have tried to help there as well...

the bouncers slash doorman shockingly claimed it was worse than a knife attack but i will not contradict his feelings even if the video did not demonstrate surprise other than hers...

on social media she made an apology to a mountain of naysayers and posted a cartoon about how skin color is whatever well as long as it does not glow in the dark or the like i suppose...

anyway i concluded the thing with ringing in lennon ono woman is the nigger of the world...

one could waste a shit load of time in between jews and palestinians and race relations, if one were so inclined...

yes, i know its pointless to attempt to help a woman even if it works there is no - well there is always another sob story down the line...

but for some idiotic root reason my reaction is to defend the girl...

i ordered kfc and did little else other than collect coins and some tezos into my coinbase which now claims that i have not verified my id, which i did, to claim their learn and earn...

what is more shocking than racism, financial oppression by corporation. 

wow, and in the afterglow of stealing the bch which i earned via bitcoin aliens who sent it promptly yet never arrived. 

well, speaking of awful  commotion mother was made upset by one of her nephews and most likely his wife telling her that aunt was in the clinic and on the precipice of passing away...i told her to not make it worse by worry and later got the details right so as to set her at ease...language is a virus yet still may serve to settle matters ps in browsing the news a man named william shakespeare had passed away, again, they said knowing full well the irony implied of course it was then mentioned that he had had the first injection of one of the vaccines...i did not read the articles already knowing willy shakes had long ago passed away.

gee, that movie about him and his daughter and his lost son sure was good...and wpuld make a neat contrast at to olivia...but i get it mixed up with the darwin, no the uhm dickens film...yeah also quality...well darwin too, moments of pure cinematic magic in it...

148 27 may

got up late, had strange or unusal dream speaking with mike kilmer...i was using laundry detergent instead of coffee when fixing up the java...asking him about emilio...

cannot say with certainty what it meant, if anything...

later in the bathroom a premonition that was eerily true in that i intended to make sure water was not leaking but forgot in the mayhem of news yet when i returned sure enough huge drip which i sealed as soon as i could...

feeling yet full from all the steak and potatoes and pasta i decided not eat...

another trip to dreaded supermarket, its as if the trauma knows no end...

later i did have some waffles and in the evening fifty eggs, nobody can eat fifty eggs...sorry if you have no film knowledge...i ate three boiled eggs...

spent the evening thinking about the duchess and scenarios that might need be overcome...

i did hiatus for a few minutes to five insta  stories propelled by nell who said we are run by stupid frogs...

it is a great set of juxtapositions as i spilled out peace frog and aristophanes and a kerouac chorus and even elvis with frog went a courtin...

then riding back in uncertainty as to who what how why and where well not so much where as i pondered her trip to new york in 2014...

meanwhile aleksandra posted a lot of cleavage...this made me wonder for a minutes...

you could say it was mental sort of night as i tried my best not to get excited or distracted even as i viewed vulgar scenes in my searching in my researching...

im just like you its two in the morning and i dont know nobody, yes more cinema...

except it is that time well on the east coast as across the sea it is later, early morning or further out it is even afternoon...

obviously thinking of her trip as she is currently going through scotland...

it cannot be easy, but maybe my concern helps...

another worry has now eased in that my quest for bitcoin has finally got a few more points as the withdraw threshold reached now to wait until sunday as before it would cost more and i do no wish want to save as much for my daughter, daughters...wife, wives, muses...

i fully expect that currency to reach well over expectations in the near future...

funny, the cia as of last night, made no mention of janine brookner...

i did not know the tale and still only know the headline...it seems she was a top notch operative in the field but felt the sexism or such was way wrong, i think she got fired or quit and then went into legal litigation winning either vindication or a settlement or both and writing a book...piercing the veil or something along those lines...

one tough bitch it appears but as us often the patriarchy case not one documentary video to be found on all of youtube...

one link video on dailymotion to download pdf if one agrees to get some product...

i suppose one has to read between the lines through the available articles...

ah echo of lyric yes i put out stand back in domain update...

hearing now without playing it, a bizarre sensation, nearly frenzy...

"if i was right or wrong" silvio yet is that good or bad...i suppose it is on the shoulders of the listener...

myself switching in mind to stevie in the original nicks...

such a wonderous voice...

i am still surprised i even got near to good in that one...

yes yet another guitar avoided day...

its,some sort of voodoo, one might say...

bla bla blah, what am i getting at?

nothing, only a note inside many notes wherein only a few will ring out past ourselves, past the future.

28th two am

the girl that reminds me of the duchess , sam, a cheerleader...once upon a time in cheer spree post...came through tik tok, said she had been in camp training...looked well yet something seemed awry...with her i mean,

hope she is well and gets more attention...

meanwhile in a,stunning surprise the girl from the call visited kate, it has to be the event of the year...perhaps even more...

too much for words even if held down by social distancing...

i got up late after feeling a buzz as i talked with brenda...had to get cheese and and another waffle in order to calm my nerves for sleep...

i did not recall dreams but upon waking i sprt of saw a scene wherein my sisters husband the new one was trying to get into my house while i switched on the locking mechanism of the window or perhaps balcony door...

such a strange and unpleasant sensation...

it eased later but not entirely as i cooked and ate missing thoroughbreds more than i can say as if reflecting in lisa being absent and that sensation highlighted by a very slow download of the devils eye...

which i will hopefully see tomorrow...

have not seen a bergman in a while, weirdly it was here at a long gone corner of independence avenue movie house that on a whim i got all the magic of fanny and alexander...

i fed the cat from left overs after making ten animations from the neon demon as it felt appropriate in that elle at ello word play...

added in hashtags on one to see how different would be the reaction...

then i worked on a revamp for the two skinny girls tik tok but i have yet to figure out how to get excited over my own promotional content...

in contrast when maria posted a video i poured myself excitedly and freely as if life itself depended on it...

anyway i left the clip as a draft unsure if i now want to update my stance which was not to use the music there but since it is lyrics that i intend...i dunno...elegy of confusion...

is silence still  golden? or has it become silly...

cannot say, can say that at midnight i felt myself as if replaced by some void, empty of any feeling or even sensation...

the russian girl dreaming of me must have pulled my soul alongside her pillow...

nice press everywhere but one does get dizzy at the sight of henry kissinger's brother' s obituary after one has made a quote and picture...

my leaning is republican if forced to be political and i have admiration for nixon but point is that it was hk that led me to knowing about spengler...and it is good to know even if ignorance was anciently equated with bliss...

one more thing, liens songs were in a festival setting which came on the nearness of rifkins...

man woman or teen i forget to ask her about the film she was making.

1122 30 may

midnight nears i hang around feeling like the character in usual suspects put placing together all the tidbits that could not be obvious yet sensed...

750 hp lambo lisa marie divorced michael lockwood a little line of pink clues the hospital with only one doctor himself dying every picture tells a story bad dreams and all

something is off, weird in a laptop that has now taken over three weeks...

i will leave the story of the recent interaction out yet will say it seems awful suspicious...

kaiser sosa kepellmeister contradictions...

yet let us here not to hurry into worry...

i awoke at noon or minutes before still feeling fine from thinking lauren had not only seen my message but also responded in some subtle way leading to happy orgasm as even the other lauren made herself visible elsewhere...

late at night loving the macbeth tidbits, no better use of the word catalogue anywhere...

i was overcome by a force, i would say it was the ghost of eddie van halen...

in short found the buzz issue and resolved it yet recalling how cool it felt on certain tracks, ten dollars an hour it aint for no flathead oh my dear bertolt brecht...

i guess he might be still be surprised that i did not admire his playing although i adore van halen before hagar...

roth is the definition of irreplaceable...

still i found myself although no intention to finger tap the fret board going for yellow tape wrap...

perhaps to make a spirit content...

the dylan 80 day wherein i could not help as if transfixed myself watching his concert with the dead for that sound, all you can say aint enough about jerry as a guitarist, a lead guitarist...once in a while as if naturally one plays along and hits some magic but with him it was in the blood, flowing, breathing...

song after song in a signature like a stamp...

sometimes a stampede, you know...

so in other words there is my admiration in terms of style, playing style. 

its consistency so powerful.

ray vaughn didnt read and i dont think he practiced scales much but they say jerry did scales all the time...

im writing these thoughts possibly as a way to get into the new lauren songs...

i practice one scale rarely but before being hounded and feeling the nearby fright i would play all the time or at least daily...

john 5 is right, playing to a variety of music gets one accomplished...

i dont regret learning specific song but i see the fruitlessness of that activity as it only serves to impress others by imitation instead of improvisation unless of course one is in a cover band or touring within a pattern...

what will this record be, become...

hmm in the morning maria sent me in a wild chase for something new and different, twelve pictures later i thought i had ten maybe a couple were uncommon and it all culminated in fourteen stills...

i loved that frenzied run...

two waffles and a peach...

i love the smell if peaches...

the day was over before i could finish cleaning newly inspired by her somehow instead of lisa...

yet i thought of them both as i here and there made order of the mess, like a master of mop and scrub...

four fried chickens and a coke, well no five pieces with pepsi fries...

i sighed again after calling myself a housewife as raised in cultures where men simply did not kitchen it amuses me to joke as if it were still unthinkable well it is for many...

the jacuzzi filled and the plants watered...to boot...

maybe june will be goodly...i thought of naya as i ate...

the leftovers, plentiful at bone, at the white cat negotiating the light passing rain...

because of annelina i brushed by yocandy, her newborn baby she called chino nearly making me think she thought of me as termed often chico...

 Can he live in NY on $3? 

Like a prince. Of course he won't be able to eat, but he can live like a prince...

at least no one is talking paternity suits...

to think of it janes brother and him were born near simultaneous...

it is one might consider a sure thorn in the side of parents that babies actually dont do anything for months except grow...

adorable they might be, but in terms of conversation, well...

in terms of talk, downstairs actually dared call out on me with the word amigo...you could not shrug in enough disgust as it seemed to be over,a drain that pours from balcony down to balcony but i did not architect engineer or dumb enough to yell instead of diverting the water with funnel or hose holy shit then in the back an audible meeting man calling woman supermarket name as if game to continue at intrusion over perceived infraction, can you imagine! 

often i do not enjoy solitude yet these people make it feel as if divine not to have them around.

the dumbest slob could see that it was twice provoking an argument even as they have the nerve to park in this apartments garage...

what is one to do except hope their expiration date is sooner than later...

now then to concude the night the month the memory of all that is not worth the while...

i am not only justified in my feeling, i am confident in my position. no need to say more,yet it is unsettling that a raised voice might still cause such come right in as it were until the sun rises, in the house of invisible inertia that seemingly surrounds my palacial kingdoms of love literature and music, filling it with attractive lights.

two am june 

the day as not and neither was the night...

how is it...going to fight at the front without bullets...i got up as if from a drunken dreamless slumber, was it sleep i wondered...

always uneasy at the thought of having to go to a bank...possibly why i like the likes of cryptocurrencies...

a glance at my schillings, now at 0.84 euro per each...

yet i was running out of smokes...so awful supermarket first...

feeling not into a long walk i contemplated the mall bank yet the line was visibly too much to deal with...

so adding to my already decided to go to preference supermarket i sauntered up further into the road hoping maybe jessica would be there and she was pretty in silk white top but i get the grump that claims they have had issues with credit card processing a statement contradicted at later phone call...oh to have to return to bank line within the month you see my current visa has an end date of july...

still switched a few dollars to see the rate there, made a deposit to see the balance, then withdrew and stopped for minute to spy the outline of her tits...

perk a boy right up, but man woman or teen that long walk all sticky by the entrance dazed shopping to make pasta which held some sense memory soup flavor who knows...

where was i, four more stickers for the frying pan, learning both angelinas were now gone one i think quit and the other at churchill store...

i must have even with money appeared in need as the cashier suggested that i still had credit on my points account as i grinned pulling from the wallet then leaving to camphor pack momentarily transfixed by woman eye contact and such neatly polished nails...

calling aunt miami a house full of fullness im certain she feels at home and freed from the bizarro world of her other son...

two five gallon bottles of water, made the del cecco stirring the bacon...

as the pepsi took its time to near freezing point...

a lot of the while maria in my thought and hallucination...a few more sent today notably a juxtaposition with botticelli and cherished friend article maria tallchief...

ballerina you should have seen her...

i saw at some point the spiderman suit line from the duchess, a true surprise...

it inspired a one off piece glitch...life can be brilliant once in a while...

he said, im still in shock.

soon i would be too but in a different way, last night ran out of bandwidth so windscribed downloaded new configuration which always needs to be renamed to work with wireguard but it oddly did not work then suddenly disappeared...got another one and that worked but noticed a bunch of gigabytes missing and so bewildered i deleted brave browsing history in case of hack, a few recent apps, but in doing so it seems the action included passwords...

not ideal and not my intention, but i figure that mostly it will not require too much attention or fixing even if it is a loss in terms of time and there might be a couple that i wont know which email was associated luckily i only use two but then again the worst might be the type that might take off distanced from memory forgot as to make the effort pointless as nearly happened with ethereum classic...

in any case, my most visited sites one i remembered and the other i re set...

yet back to logic, how does a file disappear as if macbeth witches into air...

why was a download opening in sublime text editor then missing characters from private key? and why did windscribe display ten of thirty as being used making me write emails and tickets only to see a few minutes a later that it was 32 of 30 as adjusted weirdly given that they credited cash so why the extra two?

in any case, belly full and drowsy i knocked off the evening at seven or so but was wideawake at nine and still...

no dream no illumination, someone said they could  not austen and i suggested audiobook but they maintained some sort of prejudice against headphones...

i cant imagine except for the look of certain spellings especially in terms of foreign names...it was my only discomfort at the castle in the forest...

otherwise i cannot see not liking audiobooks except in badly performed scenes as in the viy which made it seem trivial instead of tantalizing...

an action to be outlawed, one would hope.

much like the tapes of queen of night under the name of callas...

well, i even put placed master and margarita at the realm, sounds good, bulgakov...

i have only read that in print although recordings must have been available...

might get to it after getting my fill of 1606 folio having found a film i feel will serve as wonderful audio to listen to...

one thirty june

although i got up late i walked the drizzle rain to aunts house, the place a mess. i did rid some bags but it would take hours to fix all the plastic...

she did say i  could help myself to what i wanted but i debated the electric toothbrush and finally left it...

there is a weird feeling there now as if one could not properly think, later in walk baffled by bewildering right leg pain...it was the left leg that other time i then started taking a taxi...

screaming in head at this confusion i encountered the cat as i proceeded to limp up the stairs and pimp myself into cool water then dress from the dissipated heat, open one of the tuna cans and return to feline yet it was gone...it wasnt until evening when would meet again...

to think the morning was going so swimmingly, making love to muses and even accenting in preejaculatory fluid each fling as if it had to be that way...

putting away the haul, well the few items i pulled from her haul, i struggled...

first in heating up cold pizza slices since the toaster oven requires a specific wiggle before turning on...

then the internet would not tune in on iphone and bought data from isp but that was funky as hell and then called them but they need to have an active signal said a guy working from home you could hear the wife and kids and then toggled on and off and reset network settings and hot spot from laptop all to find safer vpn had boggled down to a looping halt and then everything was fine when removed...replaced by keep solid yet still the irk thought in mind that perhaps somepne had fiddled with the equipment making me switch screensavers...

fucking weird, in between finding the wifi password and making sure it was not the 12th as now a wedding date which seems to hold arguments within as jealousy or distraction frequentlt prevail, i animated monica dao...

a pretty cool gif, it is also in response to all the insanity over asians being seen as connected to pandemic...

as i had intended previously, well as i thought...

 preboobsee...

a girl said she swore guys didnt like tits...

yet whole books nay enyclopedias are printed near weekly about the breast even if they are under varying genres and disguised in other names...

anyway another haul box is coming yet i know not when...

for a minute i worried while my leg played havoc, that the box was translated as coffin...

worse than death of course is being made to think father might make a trip put placing me in the awful position of hiding from all that is him in order to save what remains of me...

something about a military settlement, they like to pay them here especially generals, prevents a coup one imagines...

whatever, it is unfortunate that much of the day seemed to involve as if by force the exact things i have worked so hard to avoid...

still, one wonders what is the point in those intent on wasting time?

in the meanwhile, my menu page safer ad now gone and in its place american airlines vintage.

ps, it does not feel like june but a massive attempt at some sort of repeat replay in order not to face the future by some unnamed forces.

329 4 june

a slow evening that started by trying to adjust china girl which track now i feel uneasy over...perhaps i chose the wrong take...

still, a nice set in between two animations...

earlier as i wandered over to shop wondering how it could be a holiday, dead pigeon on the sidewalk near helios, a man in red plaid shirt kept trying to next to me even later at line there he was with a watermelon...i walked away and picked up some peaches...the cashier got my cigarettes before i asked...

anny said it was corpus christi day...

a cop tried to walk next to me as i away making me turn then to around the other way go...

it is not even this quiet on good friday...

aunt now in miami says and sounds feeling better...

i listen to some of iggy pops the idiot and very much liked his version of china girl...

i also found sixteen and think perhaps to cover it before the sweet sixteen muses turn seventeen...

since i was listening, i actually got to tom jones who really did that dylan song i used to all the time, his videos so professional they seem to sparkle...best of songs, in terms of surprise was no hole in my head...

he sits there handcuffed turning into several people all the while insisting that titular refrain...

an army of one...

like a cat speak of the devil yes milk happy...

but then a very strange burst of vulgarity from sister...and her husband.

nothing horrific yet still distracting as if it should mean something to me...

luckily i avoided the thought most of the night until a sort of work thing i set up for myself was at satisfaction...

although it was lisa's brown nails that held my attention early it was lauren that seemed to be dreaming within my imagination as i could swear i seen her grin into my eyes...

into my eyes the new duchess video but unlike the others the nurse herein seemed, much like her joy filled picture taken after being told her mother was ill, the very definition of self absorbed in that her concentration was me contrary to her profession as care giver...

perhaps it is cultural. a culture i do not know or understand...

imagine the chance to speak with royalty and then let it go as if it was ordinary...

weird as was the news, relating to other subjects...you could feel the shift, like someone pushed a panic button and the blundering stories got blurted out as in the blind leading the blind...

one puppet ex president claiming instead of his gay right legacy that the current puppet poser is going to finish what he well he didnt actually do anything but what he pretended to start...need to see if any girls get kidnapped tomorrow...i swear they must be the only ones laughing at their own hollow joke...all the dozen men that went to look out at the open border sideshow must gave been there to see who to blame when new taxes send them to early graves as the national debt mounts so as to impoverish generations yet to be down the line...

if it werent such a serious matter one could giggle at the pretense, but how to enjoy such a disaster?

makes one feel sorry for the men that have to hang around protecting the likes of them...

but not my concern except this sort of orwellian totalitarian disguised as fill in the blank as it evolves sort of affects us all...

knives, as they have no guns, are surely being sharpened for a reported meeting with the queen...

what is he going to say, for every few words i speech  somebody gets shot to shit in america...

in pondering this without giving it time, it felt to me how fine a leader angela in germany has actually been even if for my taste she went overboard with the immigrant refugee leaning...

burroughs was more than right, you cannot fake quality any more than you could a meal.

i of course recall my previous manuscript and the poison turncoat royals which i chalked up as puppets too granted without the power to drop bombs on afghanistan soon to be hell hole numero uno...but since i felt it pulling at me either through hack or memory, how can one tell? i do not agree that he is doing some sort of backwards play to help her royal highness which you yourself can calculate at  the passing of her consort...unless we are to consider dying helpful...an awful thing to have such distance in a family...but what can we do save stand on the ground of logic thankfully miles away from that circus...

some rag suggested the duchess was trying to heal the rift in the firm, but even if it is to be expected in her nature the mere fact of someone going to canada to get away from it all only to wind up in los angeles and television well i would speak to cressida before proceeding...

my only concern actually is that she has not got time off in a while and those children are living as if they cant afford summer break...

anyway, cleaned the kitchen and will not have to cook until sunday or even monday if i opt to order in as there is still pizza in the ice box.

i actally think of her and the bacon topping she mentioned every time i go for the pie but me i like it plain.

336 5 june

i realized i had not actually given over the site from mine to her art until i unfollowed as i do with lemonade with mint...

the notion however arrived after the fact as if it had been waiting for me...

i have not noted that instagram has recently restricted all my so called likes...

christina wrote fuck a criminal in picture caption...

master and margarita...could not help but watch a lot of it...

alexandras mother felt as if arrived at my kitchen...memories of the duchess scar at the ball scene, as i imagine it must be as heavy in the not so literal sense...

i was most of the day spellbound by lisa and her new six hair ties...

possibly i have not mentioned here how i love hair...

noticed the symmetry in three girls going to salon today in dofferent cities...

me i went to the shop i like now with 8 of thirty tickets for that frying pan i want...

a girl on a pink dress and white wireless headphones walked by i offered her my umbrella but she omly smiled then after getting stuck behind arguments for points i found myself telling franny how attracted i was to her nails i felt she made a point of touching my hand and it was then i noticed what full c cups she has under those highly shaved eyebrows...

pizza and two calls and about a girl where china girl was -

ruffle of a shuffle in the box roaches as if out of thin air pretty unusual for a pie...

i often leave it out without incident yet tonight made my way downstairs to dispose of the contents...

must be some salt loving cockroaches, from the beach side perhaps or desperate...

or even worse in my raid theory reflecting some illicit activity...

its not that i am swayed in that paranoid direction, it is based on several too many previous experiences...

it was as followed the feeling of mix up with maria as she posted but i sensed nervous instead of affection even as i sent in three very nice prints but i cannot worry over what i cannot control and im sure girls know what knaves and fakes lurk even among the lesser of rock stars such as i...

last and not least, the elder lemon tree is at long last regaining some vitality...

egg shells and dedicated water bottle seem to be helping...

holy tree i hope it remains strong.

132 june 6

i get a call at 1105 to meet a man for a package due, he says twenty five minutes, i am still naked drowsy having been pulled away from what felt like some vampire witch muse making love to me in dreams, i dress i settled some matters quickly and get a cab hoping to not be late...im there at 1130 i water plants and wait i find the doll the aunt mention deep in the closet and wait i get rid of some if the cluttered plastic bags and wait 1230 turns to 130 as i walk back not wanting to spend more on further taxi...as i cool down in the jacuzzi and try to start my natural day the phone rings, he says what men say when lying and tries to blame me...after admitting his delay...still i offer to go but he refuses to wait, i say deliver it here but he says he cannot even as he suggest leaving the box with someone i might know near there but i know no one that i would impose on in that way...finally he says the package will be left for the next trip when they drop things off...how bizarre but the fact that he called nearly as soon as i got back indicates some sort of stunt...

i settle into the day making maria wait as i knew she had posted but i waffle and scroll through some necessary sites for claims and such...

i wind up sending two animations in modern glitch style and six prints some of which were exceptional as in one where the shoe took center stage as it were...she was dressy today and looked divine...

i made pasta and then in a rant and rave at cheap documentary on the third reich...

no facts and sound bytes...i swear if people dont get world war two they will never get anything...everybody wants to turn the nazi party into a trick that was performed by magicians but in doing so they never mention the amazing details much less contrast how everyone including the jews followed that blueprint...you will say no way but ask palestine.

it is there in total war, not hitler not himmler not goebbels not any individual but a collective unity the very soul of a nation took a stand and never surrendered.

it is not only amazing, but awe inspiring.

of course americans are the first to cry racism or genocide yet they fail to contrast the native americans still being obliterated and the spill over into other lands vietnam conflict which also was a coup against theso called inner cities as invaded by heroin which later augmented by continued casualty in south america in the form of cocaine...one could laugh yet it is not funny and to dismiss the nazi regime as tricksters or trivialize them is a great danger...

it aint no joke, and if one is careful enough to respect this logic then one can still feel the emotional thunder cracking open the skies above our heads.

the weight of it all sent me to sleep early awaking at about ten at night...

i fed the cat tuna as it pressed against me and another cat looked at us as if mirroring an even further cat across the avenue...

termite door corrosion i found surprised and sprayed with cleaner inside and out...i am out of the wood preservative and hate to think of how many bottles i have already purchased in trying to prevent that decay.

anyway or otherwise it turned out a nearly nice day even the kitchen is still mostly clean except for one plate one fork and two pots.

sunday arrives and i hope it is an improvement on this now gone saturday.

19 april. re did three songs of the six recorded 15 and 16th...

i am pleased with a couple of them, surprised to some extent.

it is ten forty in the morning, way past bed time.

dreams have been elusive these days.

i read carmilla and it reminded me of what i thought a flaw in the accursed and how to avoid it by simply put placing the books one is to mention at the end instead of the start...

as in my case it led to seeking out those tomes and i didnt get back to the novel.

carmilla came about after viewing the film of 2019 with delayed release...

the german actress truly dazzles the eye...

still it made me miss my repeated viewing of thoroughbreds...

ms taylor joy was on my mind yet in such an excited and then somehow crowded manner...

perhaps one should expect a bit mire attention when releasing music...

in any case, trying to get some shut eye, having returned from supermarket wherein yonaudy so gracefully and carefully packaged one item that it seemed a gesture of love...

a magical figure possibly a touch under five feet and round as a ball with a happy pale countenance that seems more irish than anything...a bit like bernadette from the eighth grade but only in the slightest degree...

before then i delivered a large bag of chicken to my aunt still in her night gown who waited with sonia and vanessa strangely their ages appeared mixed up and i noted as such verbally...

the taxi waited and let me go at,a fair price...

i was tempted to tip but really the distances traversed were negligible, hmm, were neither long in minutes nor in miles...

i was struck recently in contemplating my fowl gift that i had actually never cooked chicken.

some cook some do not cook...well, i do but not hen.

well, then...i should have purchased potato and bacon...

it did not cross my mind.

i hope to awake for notes upon the program i am currently viewing in the late afternoon but i will not set an alarm as part of me is content to not have "television" yet that book already is in the making...

untitled in the scream for t rex notebook.

ps, headline beyond the two volcanos - soufriere and sinabung - that caught my eye "Loujain Al-Hathloul wins Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize"

20. april. i had some inclination to re read dead souls...although i have yet to conclude harlot's ghost and much less the accursed...not to mention those nabokov tomes...

well, the first few chapters i thought as it would only take some minutes yet i found myself captivated all over again and nearly three hours later as a sweaty chichikov finally gets the souls from the weird old woman i sighed in satisfaction and pulled the plug on the audiobook but it was worth it for in that listen, i caught the introduction, those biographical notes and especially the author's own commission to his readers...

also wondered then if bulgakov had gogol in mind when writing his immortal line...

i awoke, after a sensational, sensual, and surprising fantasy several times each thinking it was later than it actually was until about three in the afternoon...

i made baconless pasta and plan to see the courier within the evening...

21. april, viewed but much liked the second half more...

in terms of history it did not seem to accent how real an imposition it was that threat of nuclear war, i have seen how even school children were exercised in class to "prepare" them in case of a bomb...

cannot imagine what that does to one's psyche...

of course we still see remnants of the cold war in the manner america and russia interact politically...

it was a true story but for movie buffs the resemblance to dennis quaid distracts from a magnificent performance...

strangely  i was thinking of alexandra as i started this new journal, and the counterpart is named or rather self proclaimed alex...

hopefully it reflects some triumph on our part...

egomania being a common fault of the artist yet how else might one actually continue to craft without considering oneself, humble as one might be, in terms of the superhuman, supernatural...

i interacted physically with the white cat as it approached me with a caress, it seemed happy that i touched although it was quick and also it seemed equally concerned with the meal at hand...

another cat, a kitten has been meowing for two nights. all along the avenue, i watched it as it paused while crossing with a larger feline which kept on trucking even as the kitten wailed...

after the film qnd some hours i took down a saucer of milk but i do not think it helped...too young to understand that it should be picked up and saved and too wild -being feral- to attempt to grab...in fact, nothing to do albeit i kept looking in fact in the vain hopes of something goodly...

it is grey, like princey was in syracuse, or even the blue russian i picked for the cover of wild is the wind, or worse shimmer yet let us pray that no such tragic fate conspires against this defenseless cat...

in returning another cat magically appeard and stood pretty near where i had stood curiously for a moment then slid across and sped by under my balcony...

is it a kitten that cats don't like?

is it something about the bizarre stain on that chair in the entertainment room...

noticed after the return from aunt and shopping...

worried over intrusion, tried to dismiss it but it kept echoing in my mind's eye nearly like a message even if i failed to understand...

i curve back into one of my own  lines, there is no why because.

should really employ that one to bring out all the possible meanings...

well i should wait until the day has actually been before being here...

the day turned out to be, with the exception of what seemed an eternity waiting to buy a landline from claro after paying my bill because somehow three phones have failed in under a year and i refuse to pay more electricity for the wireless aparatus, a day of intermitten sleep without any specific dreams...

i had a notion to make steak and potatoes and that turned out divine even if it was a touch peppery...

the marksman came through and i was struck by the implication that certain cartel members can cross the so called border without identification...prolly true. princess anne read the passport...

liam seems to have got his clint eastwood longevity visa with this one...

tempest storm was said to have passed away and curiously an indonesian submarine and crew went missing...

i awoke in the wee hours, still dreamless and gave the white cat some of afrementioned   meal.

another white cat, this one with brown tan ears, took turns looking at me and the white cat and the meat and the wedge of potato...

i note the current prices of some cryptocurrencies and consider what to do with the oncoming thursday...

22 april

thursday, went over to aunts house bringing her a set of drinking glasses and kitchen towels along with a face cream...

she gave me further vitamins and two shirts one jones one van huesen...heusen...hmm he use n...

i stopped at the pawn shop to see if they had any guitars...a squire, but pricey...

hopes of something eclectic there are mininal but still...

worth the look as it gives at least the knowledge...

i was inclined to order from the chinese restaurant and did so...

it had been well over a year...strange to consider as in the city it would be next to normal...

a nap that seemed like a drug induced drowsiness...

blurred effect in the 406 soap bit before the program...

which turned out to be pretty insightful as it seemed to employ galvan's editorialism and in doing so it felt more true than i had sensed before...

n...14, michelle lied over her age and started broadcasting then...

a story idea came to me as if for a minute the spirit of burroughs spilled out a skit in my skull...

head, odeya hurt, bandaged...i worked at crafting an animation with Asmodeus  [ashmedai, Asmodevs, Ashema Deva, Amias...]

i think it turned out well, of course i blame the second claro customer line wait of an hour to get a phone after the first line to pay the bill...

i hoped she would be well and that hope held my hand into leonardo for matilda reasons and i was not disappointed in fact impressed...

as the men stumble about, she shines...

so bright, so right...

now truly justified in my earlier inkrealm praise post...

i thought also of course of the importance of the muse and really started to enjoy the fact that i had started crediting certain muses as cowriters...as the art would in fact not exist or be otherwise without them...

a striking realization made sharper by that show...

even more striking was the hint of isabellas nipple piercing in glow up tank top...

after sweden, as i surfed from one room to the other, i found havana was live, smoking electricity vapor and drinking red wine...

i watched for a while, but still too wrapped up in the jealous tv shadow which seems to resent my five to six work...

eyewear has melted, chair stained, climate switched, distractions as if the envy could not contain itself...

hmm...

i consider going back to bed while waiting to update my domain...

two things though, i learned of ms rush's mishap directly following some research on minister of propaganda joseph goebbel...

as i had posted his total war speech in print translation because trying to find the entire text online is a trial for some reason and he was in fact speaking not only to germany but to the world - during the research i noted how highly intent on fashion the reich had been, he says better to dress down now than to have future generations suffer in rags...

sadly, the caricature and soundbyte overwhelm the power of some of that document.

it's like only knowing the ask not portion of kennedy inauguration instead of the rest of that prophetic poetry...

in fact, i think no one has ever mentioned the clothing aspect of total war although implied in the lack thereof within some  burial grounds and work camps...

i know i obsess like with the american civil war or 22 november 1963 or perhaps the endless variations inherent in a major g chord as far as thinking 1945 was the end and all else reverberates from it even  in israel and everywhere else...

allow me to conclude thursday wondering how i can miss someone's Joy without having actually met outside of imagination...a weird Taylor has dressed me in constant remembrance of a certain alluring witch.

23 friday...

day one of task - elements, the evening standard and the tatler - 

in contemplating muses and inspiration, the one i always find myself wanting to return to in order to create more is the duchess of cambridge, her royal highness, catherine middleton,

now last year there was a situation with a story in the tatler and it seems as a result or in retaliation they set themselves up to plant insinuations...sort of like land mines...

at least that is my first impression...

more recently the impossible hoopla involving a televised talk by other "royals" has in some case divided parts of the press and these sections among them include the evening standard which seems presently to engage in not covering the duchess as well as posting puff pieces on the other "royals"

these others, it goes without saying, cannot be justified neither in logic nor in decency.

i hinted at the pac man mentality in one art work when a whirlwind of rumor surfaced, but i had no idea how much of a crack cocaine mentality existed in their greedy addiction to press for fame...

 none of this matters as in fact nobody stands by the standards even as the monarch herself suffers! 

now then the task at hand is to define what the evening standard intends and how to derail the tatler as far as inuendo...

my reasoning is or should be obvious, a woman that has taken the time to not only improve her family but future generations of all society cannot be cornered like some reality tv show shadow or two bit actor...well, in this day and age of diminishing respect for all things, it can be done, so allow me to put it another way,  a caring woman of grace and compassion should not have to concern herself with the worry over nearly insignificant publications such as these two that stand only by the slim approval of a thinning crowd...

should we continue to be cowards and simply let them carry on?

no. at least i cannot. 

and yes some of her articles are goodly and even favorable but these are unbalanced by those alluded to here.

historians will look at all the articles and some might be rightly confused when the saintly is dragged through the mud or when they find vile hints...

in fact, what i am thinking is an extreme yet all will agree she deserves nothing less.

the question,  of course remains, how?

i will start with examination and evaluation and see where that leads.

now as far as journal, i slept twelve hours and still my dreams escape under the radar of memory...

it is noon, it is hot, it seems all the news has come to a halt.

i can only imagine newspaper folk are planning an  easy weekend...

even russia has pulled back the troops from ukraine border and the strange navalny plant has ended his hunger strike...

yes a bit of a flame in jerusalem and hours to go before the submarine is confirmed gone but  maybe im wrong and everybody just wants to honor shakespeare...

finally, obviously not every story can be praise nor should it be so long as the criticism is objective, intellectual, in a perspective which produces as she intends an improvement for children, for the world...

to that end, i need to find a way to fight those two especially the hidden insinuations as truly i cannot think of any manner in which to dismantle the misguided propaganda involving the other "royals" who will likely be swallowed and spit out via their own disgusting orgy of greed the likes of which has never been seen in all the annals of well maybe caligula went on a similar type of stupidity.

so in early weighing, the concentration will be not so much on the evening standard, only guilty of trying to substantiate insanity, but on the tatler which is actively engaged in a side road  campaign of distracting insinuation.

i always liked the standard anyway well until they began treating dissidents as if deserving of editorials...

in reviewing the tatler stories today, mere moments after learning that the body of the amish girl had been found strangled and stabbed, i found that it was as if they intended a preemptive strike with not one but three stories concerning her royal highness and one of them adorned by a piece on audrey hepburn...

it is a huge switch of stance which if kept swimming could save me some time, i am although saddened by the remembrance of linda, amazed at this turn of events...

a much better turn than da vinci being a homosexual which may well have been a rumor fetched by jealous hacks during his life or even after his death...

not that it matters, but it distracts from the actual subject and after the strange political cheerleading for gayness it cannot serve society in any way but a divisive one, how well wonderful it would have been to asexualize him thus portraying him beyond these confines...my feeling stems also from the time period wherein such an artist must have been overwhelmed by the church...in looking it up, i learn that he studied catholicism extensively and even confessed upon his death bed in order to be right with his maker as it were...

let us not forget he made the last supper...

sure some will juxtapose the argument that it gives a sense of worth or validation to little gays growing up, that would be nice, unfortunately it is not true since their stupid attackers will not even have heard of the mona lisa.

in that look, more importantly, i found some scholar took the latin phrase from Ginevra de' Benci and adding the name of the tree came up with a few dozen anagrams all of which, she claims, reveal the story behind the painting...

a truly exciting revelation even if it is only partly true.

the anagram, you will note is following me...this month, first in carmella and now here unexpectedly...

alas, often the anagram is alike the submarine story, we know it is there yet we will not get to it in time.

my thoughts direct me to sterling and the recurring dream story concentrating on the date, seven december...

pearl harbor...

the character knew the consequences but could not convince anyone...

i am convinced of the magic within the great art, yet the self same magic takes minutes hours days years or more or perhaps even eternity...

surely this will feel like forever as we have crossed back and forth between the 1500s and gossip grooves of yellow press and juniper trees...as my own mind focuses on how lovingly ms galvan mentioned that one of the cosmonauts on the new space x was named just like her daughter without mentioning her child yet we could see how much she wants a brightly fantastic future for that girl...

 i mean to learn from all of this, for myself yet in writing it down i consider without capitulation to style that it might also help others down the line...

24 early side

having concluded my viewing of leonardo, i am happy to have watched...in the end, i still disagree with most of the male characters or perhaps characterizations, i did not exactly believe the old master, the nemesis, or the two chained men slash villains...although i did enjoy the sforza portrayal as well as the hustler...great implied line but missed, i will give da vinci back his paint but  first i will be your pimp, now get to work.

the detective was far from interesting and the child possibly needed a haircut as for leonardo himself well really to be fair there were two that is the shaved and the bearded but in either incarnation it is nearly an impossible role and i for one at the end thought he must be crying over missing the mark except his task was too taxing...genius cannot be explained through the usual methods...it might have or even should have been in italian to at least get the sounds and sayings of that poetic era...

well, or so matilda carried it and one could feel her carrying it even in the scenes without her...

with the exception of those with michelangelo and since i am bashing the boys, i held no opinion or reaction to that character but it was a pretty big hat he wore...

she gets to the audience in the very first episode and commands attention thereafter even at the "broken" pronounciation goodbye it gives a beat as weirdly unique as the others seem to be nearly breathing.

it is as if she retains some sort of innocence, of unspoiled grace the type i noticed when i happened by chance to see her speaking of the wonder bra without any sarcasm when the interviewer asked perhaps rudely about her tits on italian television...

as for the main character i suppose it does not help that when i think of that italian artist, i do so as an older man with a longer beard or even as the rembrandt self portrait for some reason not that i believe they looked similar only how it is filtered in my imagination...

the wonder of the production is the "unveiling" of the mona lisa at the outro...reminding us exactly how great his artwork, how justified his immortality...and thus excusing to some extent the rest of the actors...

it is a three chord song, but the type played in such a way so as to astound the observer leaving yet such wonder that it is beyond the notes or rather beyond style, math, or shade even in its simplicity it baffles well beguiles yes mesmerizes...alike the production which hopefully will sustain its audience...not only with those that i have here praised but as a whole since mostly it seems an honest climb into a vision in a time and place far away, over the hills...

24 later,

i stayed up into dawn, i dreamed and thought of remembering as i did...but the outline bounced away at the further snooze and in the early afternoon i can recall dreaming of a peculiar sit down on some sofa where i struggled in conversation with a dead man and perhaps his son which i dislike...

mother, reportedly getting the vaccine...

aunt said an uncle fell in church and some other man i disliked died...i told her i was glad he was gone, but really i have no emotion on the matter...i did think him a sort of ugly bully and when she mentioned that he often made a practice of relaying his genital problems i understood exectly how ugly he had been for who would overstep decency and burden an elderly lady with talk of penis...

five o clock, i am trying to decide on a walk for coffee...

five o clock the next day...

not only did i coffee but after seeing cops stationed on helios i also taxied with fish for aunt...

fed the white cat twice, now it is nearly too chummy...

after a rest, i had the inclination to clean...still more to go but the dishes and most of the floor are done...

i heard mike kilmers new addition to his dream cycle "songs" but i could not understand what his aim is...in one, strangely, he mentions five dollars on a rug and my mind raced back to when i created that collage for alexandra well specifically for the safety of her little sister...

weird feeling as if being pushed into suspicion or even some type of ethereal confrontation...

in any case, i got in another chapter of rereading gogol's dead souls...

the skit with the offer of horses then dogs then an organ...and after a sleepless night a sorry game of rigged chess...

my zec wallet did not start after an update...

still how good is it to read and earn in only minutes even if only cents...

speaking of such, strax has turned out this far to be impossible to understand...

not only do the coins not appear but they do not respond to any request...

my stance is however tempered by the fact of other currencies even if at present all coins are struggling as per usual when bitcoin hits a high a lot of folks feel the need to cash in or is it cash out...

crash out in dream within the same rags i wear around the house, zara torn at left chest shirt, ripped hem also zara jeans and the inexplicable ragged shoes, boat shoes once upon a time as if eaten by someone's envy...

i figure someone saw me either feeding the cat or deliverying something and their view played back through me, a frightening thought but it is only a theory...

the tatler went all out for lady di...many, it should be noted contrast her with the duchess and so for a second i pondered hidden meanings but resolved that nothing felt out of place...

one bitch elsewhere did suggest that a bicycle picture was intended in retaliation...but obviously as far fetched as the gambler trying every trick in that russian novel...

in any case i am starting to worry over this dream situation...

it only has happened before during drug use wherein the blur overwhelms even into waking like a sort of easy hang over yet i have not no not even drink at all...

i considered the new vitamins and only took a shot of E yesterday...

the oscars are tonight but how can i enjoy them given the blatant leaning the members have displayed in terms of nevermind talent and or merit but let us go with an inclusive rainbow coalition of nominations except for mank since it is an undeniable achievement in true story as well as hollywood history et cetera...as for myself i have my fingers knocking on wood crossed for amanda...

finally, for a while i found myself in the bizarre position of wondering how i had not cut my left index finger as i sliced frozen bacon and halfway decided quickly to chop as the package slipped and the knife confronted that upturned digit...i could even see where the cutting point seemed to be indicated and even thanked angels or demons or demonic angels for what appeared to be a milisecond of detained detonation...slice bomb as it exploded no not even blood. in fact i still the next day feel the pressure implied by the blade as if haunting my hand.

i fear telling anyone, except in writing, this magic trick, this miracle...it is the same fear i felt at blue blood with a different knife then silently wrapping a brown paper bag to hide it until red, besides who would believe me.

two thirty in the morning of the same day

reminded of the belt and the bath which nearly did me in...similar feeling reflected although not the sensation...

in a dream, i am with some man, i do not see his face is just like elvis in the sixties until the end...i have dollars in my shirt pocket the one with a zipper...thread something is the brand...he puts several packs of weed like nickel or dime bags and this pleases me...he says he wishes the lockdown to continue and i say it probably will perhaps thinking it is,a better control method than terrorism...although it is not since one attack can wipe out dozens in mere seconds...he moves some piece of wood from a platform and places it under another similar with a note as if hidden for someone to discover later...we sit after this, left leg entwined which is when i see the countenance yet the nearness even if it is elvis makes me uncomfortable and i awake thinking of some cab ride i recently had and the unfortunately verbal repairman...

amanda was not given the oscar despite all the times she has gone out on a limb for her audience...

sadly.

three in the morning of the following day...

lauren captioned, love's a plum and it stayed with me all the way until i actually went out and got a plum...which i enjoyed and then planted in between buttermilk waffles and two bananas and two hard boiled eggs...

doing an amos plumb line bible collage with her sky cloud robe after viewing a bride for henry...

long conversation with aunt and a short talk with mother...

i told her, the later, that the frances oscar howl was most likely a secret message for her...

she asked what it meant, i replied well only you would know...

note nickname for her, chobolobo...

she said she would figure it out, and i grinned recalling the movie time that actress molotov cocktailed the police station...

then fargo, as if that were her origin in my imagination...

the night flew away with turkey giblet -a word hardly used in any common conversation- can for cat and hair conditioned shower making me feel extra squeeky after working away the dirt in the broken burned jacuzzi with high powered chemicals ...

i went through another chapter of dead souls, but it was more to escape some neighbors than anything else...in any case being more than half way through i reckon why not finish the tome again...

i took an uneasy nap and awoke as if to make art promotional material for odeya rush and then completed an idea for her royal highness which preempted arsenal till i die with middleton till i die and that led to a second idea which i also executed with the funky music track of wild cherry - i could have howled myself, as it was a double blast in that the lyric would remind the viewer of the previous "story" and the two images of her displayed not only the progress but the constant balance she has maintained...well until earlier this year when the weird press tried to paint by stereotype the sorry excuse for whatever that megxit had in mind...

oh yes, the right side is catherine on her way to her first funeral and the left side is kate on her way to her famous marriage...

i might call it " the mask and the veil " as it occurs to me now how good a title that would possibly be...

hmm could it be a song, 

the veiled bride and the masked duchess...

crowds hailed wide with flash bulbs from the press...

wed. 28 midnight.

it seemed the day overwhelmed me, it reached out and tenderly sped by trampling over dreams in which surrounded by women i was given keys in sets each one settled on perhaps the chain i carry...

still the speedy minutes created its blur and suddenly two in the afternoon became four then fluttered and after primer impacto early evening six which found me waiting to flame up meat and master rice...

somehow delicious, drenched in pepper with a touch of extra onion as i started up on blithe spirits thinking of judi dench and her trees and the weird way an ember found its way all the way from my right hand cigarette to inner right sole still burning...

the meal so good especially with imaginary push and pull between thoughts of her royal highness and the queen's gambit star...

i sighed, i wanted to help aleksandra even if things did not turn out well since aunt mentioned alexi's death and eating baby shark meat for some reason and so i added more to the to do list...updating my domain to black candles set against greatful dead neon glow i reposted the first glitch i made of her adorned with mandrake the magician gesturing hypnotically and even the unsold pilot nbc episode under the notice that someone gad found a six leaf clover as if the spell could not work otherwise i released 764 for indeed she is one of those muses that felt as if the owner identified...

meanwhile i had identified weirdness in the standard when they online ran a story of the duke yet put placed a picture of her in glee which later - as i considered the matter - was "corrected"...

there was a wave of stories today given a visit to a farm with lambs sometimes reported sheep, and other things such as golf and a gps self driving tractor...

it is heart warming to see life get a bit back to normal yet sad that she goes such long stretches without vacation time...

pretty soon i imagine she will have no time at all to see the world with mounting duties and what might well be the extra pressure provided by the thousands of rattling articles which while not a danger in themselves pose a peculiar paradox which follows the logic that outside of certain circles when an unknowing crowd in some remote city hears that item or other tidbit who is to control their "reflection" as it mixes up the wrong parties or even casts an evil eye on her out of simply not knowing...

not to mention the very likely pitfall of envy and spite from those that do know yet would allow the blade of jealousy to displace reason into a bleeding wail of opposition...

i cannot conceive of any person feeling that inclination yet it may well happen or again if in fact the other royal did not suffer from said affliction...

in any case a picture of a smiling queen brought me to also update cheer spree...

as if to come full around to dame judi by a documentary on trees...yeah aha with the phrase "mindblowing" to boot...to hear the inner workings of a tree for the first time and listen as it takes a drink of water...well, perhaps there is no other phrase...

twelve thirty, i cannot recall the circumstance yey i have the clearest and keenest memory of being shocked, this as an annex to paradox, once upon a time a movie played on national television with one of the characters dying in the script that held a true resemblance to a more famous actor...thoughts tell me eli wallach, yet as i said those circumstances were several years before now and not at hand in my memory...point is the actor that resembled the one in the play passed away as if it was the 1930s when cinema could still conquer the imagination of the world and the collective unconsciousness arose as one deadly force effectively ending the resemblance.

yes, a subjective idea not based on science, an intuition grounded in two moments, hey that looks like him and a day or two later hey he is dead exclammation point.

how many people thought the same thought of the soul as if ginsberg and kerouac in sunflower sutra, how many does it take for that phemomena to go down as if drowning the celebrity by sheer radio waves...

perhaps, it is a lesson that i have yet to fully turn in the homework for at school...

but you might think to yourself no wonder commercials a repeated over and over...

the writer is not only several selves but always a student of both the highly sensational and the humdrum...

is then the answer, to this puzzle no one has asked me to solve and which i jigsaw at freely in order to satisfy my care of a favorite muse, repetition?

the response feels immature yet it is what professionals employ to turn heads as it were...

29 april.

i get up after only a few moments at rest. i was with sonya although i had been thinking of lisa in fantasies...we are telling each other what we each think of as imperfections in our faces even if we are both borderline beautiful especially her for i have found such unusual angles via cell phone cameras that even doubts gathered over my own appearance...

i touch her imaginary dream flaw and awake still feeling that the sorcerers was the wrong choice in domain update for wanting to give boris a hand since in retrospect he most likely needs it not and so quickly put placed a brush with violence since the duchess has mentioned an admiration of bacon...

that along previous posts involving her and even to my surprise one of the new prints as a sort of ten year anniversary tribute...

in the day i had flown down to aunts house presenting her with olive oil and aloe vera plant then shopped getting a very nice drinking cup very similar to my beloved colorado grill cups which were given to me seemingly for simply being nice to the waitress but were soon split by the freezing cold when left too long in the ice box...

i also purchased a yale combination lock which actually comes set to zero and i slowly figured out the reset method and switched the back door lock with it so as to give the front door a third lock.

grade and high school locker memories might have occured to me were it not for a vague sleepless hunger...

note while shopping at times it felt as if i were not wearing my glasses at all at little faraway letters...myopia had been a burden since before yet all the eye talk of recent years from several fronts has confronted me worse than old men intent on reverse reflection with erection statements...in the film a character tells it like trying to play billiards with a rope...

care and extra care must be taken at even the hint of such talk...as it is clear to me now that sickness might be transmitted through conversation...it is a miracle doctors can make it through entire careers without the afflictions they constantly hear.

i limited the food gathering to breakfast materials such as eggs and bacon not wanting to cook for a day or so except lightly and butter to finish off the waffles.

i  am considering getting more of those tall crimson cups...

after heating up the rice and pork chops and chilling the pepsi i slept from noon until six...

the phone splitter did not fit next to the tv cable as it seems necessary for it to be on a specific input yet it did work and i can once more enjoy my at&t telephone but with the current set up it is either television or phone which is not yet a reason for calamity or concern as it even reflects my own disconnection of ringer when the pleasure of a film is placed for view besides i am only seeing one show for about one hour per weekdays and i do suspect that i will soon conclude the habit for reasons of time for if in fact the mission or study of certain press items comes upon me then i will need to concentrate meaning not for the now but for the long run.

i do not know where my old phone splitter has gone as i cannot imagine how two tiles in the back room shower disintegrated...it is as mysterious as the outline of the map of england on the plumb i bought and noticed only before taking a bite...in any case the new splitter has three lines and i will soon attempt a third connection...

in my dreams i also have an unclear memory of finding the table napkins that went missing all stacked and white yet i am pretty certain they will not be found.

post script the tall red cups are stickered with the words always in your home...

after cleaning parts,of the apartment, i now take those words with eerie apprehension...

two scratches on my versace frames which i cleaned nearly an hour thinking it was dirt...

no living instance of mishap and so one concludes intrusion or invasion and this leads to a few hours of rearranging and unwanted thoughts of them nearby compounded by previous experience as if trauma set in to a twisting turn...

when i returned from aunt's house and shopping i did sense a curtain aroused from its groove but didnt think of it much until noticing the glasses...

perhaps the unmistakable yelp which i also disregarded when changing the back door lock was in fact an indication...

yet what reason or reasons?

it feels as if only to waste time.

a sort of stasiesque technique to cause a case of nervous distraction.

imagine, having nothing better to do with one's life than to upset a writer that would not even remember you existed otherwise...

so much to do, and yet these scratched frames do feel too strange in a way of sadness...

meanwhile the impossible pacman press  machine is at full swing, do they even realize that very few people actually read newspapers and those of us who do browse them usually keep to a strict system...

in my case, obituaries but also articles that catch my attention and or seem pertinent to someone i care about...

i cannot recall a more forced celebrity than these muppets!

one wishes to think they have been employed by government agencies to attempt some sort plot but the script is all over the place, chaos. nay worse than chaos - a preposterous propoganda, a meaningless repetition to make their brand a known name all together devoid of allure to myself or anyone with any sort of thoughts in their minds yet i note it to help remember and underline to myself that every once in a while this running gag gets mentioned along with the duchess wherein she is powerless to respond even if silence speaks as well as action in such circumstances...

the paranoid in me imagines they sent in a sentry to upset me in order to get in the several stupidities they are now partaking in without the likes of me logic bombing editors at their shameful agreement with nonsense...

i dare,say, the oceans are filled with trash, the air is a danger to breathe, holy trees are being cut down, cities ruining the countryside, children in all manner of filth, women and immigrants nearly without basic human rights, corruption at every other leader's desk, tons upon tons of nuclear waste, taxation and never ending spending, and indeed more could be added for each situation exceeds society's capacity for example syria, yemen, or the merry go round called afghanistan soon to be a free for all playground of drug traffic and war lords since the home of the free and the land of the brave recalled the armed forces or is it that these other royals supercede in importance even basic health care for humanity and i have got my priorities wrong?

 oh right i see they gave all of their money to starving venezuelan families and now plead via the always kind press for donations in order to make ends meet...ah no, that is only my foolish vision of what might be but never will albeit someone did do a similar stunt but nobody heard much about it until his obituary...

possibly, he could not afford a press agent...

so much for gianni versace!

my apologies to all muses for allowing a silly sense of righteousness overwhelm this journal momentarily especially on her tenth wedding anniversary.

29 later...

lisa and her new clothes made me want to move to saint petersberg...

instead i slept all day, sweetly dreaming of staying in a hotel, upon entering a room i find selena jumping out of bed leaving some strange chubby boy sitting up and speaking to me but i cannot hear his words or do not want to...it is the peanuts teacher sound effect for all i know...bla bla bla...

so much is labeled aleksandra since i have not edited her email, phone numbers, who knows what else...

in any case, she seems to be alright even glowing in a video nearly as if floating...

i admit being mesmerized even more than recently with "dick fries" or "kitty cone" what was it also that article title, the underappreciated power of human poo...

or my new favorite: "Hero schoolgirls formed human chain to save pensioner 'fly-kicked into freezing river'..."

Ellie Hughes and Khloe Woods...

in any case, i swivel away from mounting desires to care for the just in case duchess, yet except again for being lumped in with other royals, things seem nearly under control well as much as can be for someone even search engines return alongside miss pac man muppet...

i watch the show and celebrate one of the reporters in the studio wearing a suit and tie instead of at home with a tee...

at the same time equally concerned that my thoughts on the matter were heard, overheard...

a shrug and then potatoes and then bacon and then eggs and then coffee...

nell marmalade williams whistled and i thought of lauren bacall and the clash documenting the sequence on instagram...

to have and have not, bringing me back to lauren gromley and herley in the blink of an eye with further plumbs alongside ella who i also "knew" but could not understand...

perhaps ahe thinks me petulant...

all this with the worry that it is five hours later across the seas...

ten in the evening here, a month after the zulu king died, the zulu queen also died...

yet that word brings me indirectly to star trek,

"You'll find that more happens on the bridge of a starship than just carrying out orders and observing regulations. There is a sense of loyalty to the men and women you serve with, a sense of family. Those two men on trial... I served with them for a long time. I owe them my life a dozen times over. And right now they're in trouble, and I'm going to help them. Let the regulations be damned."

the jerusalem post, during the international hoopla over the other royal interview kept their integrity without a glance in that direction...

bring me the disco king, even after all this time i cannot actually mourn beyond bowie.

even if it felt as if full circle with the bird that day chronicled in secret tumblr key site notes, it is still well i do not know even as the news tells that dozens died at lag b'omer all i do is play life on mars and think upon how much he meant to myself and so many others for so many song reasons and more...

sigh.

30 april midnight

horny as all hell yet wanted to wait and as i did wrote the previous entry feeling oh what is that led zeppelin line squeezed lemon till the juice ran down my leg...something had squeezed hard and in hesitant carefulness i lay me down to bed with a throbbing desire i somehow managed to breathe through into slumber...

sleep, but not in london or volgograd but rather nearby in the spicorama wherein the taxi ride and the talk and then a long search through papers and notebooks in order to print my name and number until he hands me one as af by this point in a hurry saying here but the pen will not darken the page and i flip through a very filled cambridge notebook thinking i just saw some empty pages a minute ago meanwhile my wallet is not in my back pocket but positioned flat upon another surface as i pick it up and awake to know that i always carry my wallet in the front right pocket...

i have a notion to have a fantasy but the man that handed me the lock i last bought crowds my mind with confusion as he did when pricing a video monitor as if looking down at me and then forced to admit one would need to buy a hard drive as well as a monitor for the set up to which i said one could simply set up a motion sensitive cell phone app for a fraction of the cost...

tell some people the truth and it will turn them against you as if to spite logic itself...

of course, to conclude with the intrusion invasion thought, i actually set up a couple of smart phones in the manner described only to have both go bad like it was against the law to photograph a person in the act of raiding...

for what are the odds? 

well at least kirk will be reunited with anne.

but here is friday, the last friday of this month.

after peeing or maybe during the pee i thought of lauren with love and tried to listen as she said something with her eyes shut...

rain flooded through the clouds late last night  we shall see if may flowers...

30 april morning

to have such a thing go down on the day hitler played his final act makes too much food for thought...

in any case i finally got through blithe spirits, did not like the one twist of the books being stolen since i wanted to believe the first wife was some sort of evil genius but cannot complain over an easy going slapstick farce...

far from comedy was voyagers, after years of trying to avoid the lily rose hype there i was looking at her...however it was not distracting yet again one point at that playback scene where mob mentality turns what should have been resolution into further murder...i mean, no, it sort of pulls through but leaves that doubt as they are supposed to be intelligent yet especially at that juncture turn as one dumb robot for bloodthirst where yes it could happen but in my view unlikely...still, the emphasis on actually contemplating the future should be applauded...cannot recall any film actually considering the position of grandchildren...oh but one other criticism might be that the sound is not explained...

now then to one more princess of hollywood royalty, i thought despite possible script flaws that she performed well, not in any overwhelming or theatrical sense so as to stand out but near perfectly subdued so as to not bring to mind the related illustrious king of cinema even if lately trampled some by strange relationships and finances and law suits and even dog smuggling if memory serves yet of course history barely register anything other than a brilliant career...

i thought she looked french yet it may be her mother was from france i cannot say as i make no habit of knowing such details...

i also thought she looked some as if one of my cousins...

which happened with emily jane browning in a film that dealt with aliens...

but really neither of them actually resemble the woman i conjured in thought as it surely was in either instance my own filter seeping into view.

into view a short walk to shop with as quick as i could return to avoid the so called crowd yet still felt as if i lost myself before getting back for a few minutes...

instead of playing the clash, i played chess with the now overly aggressive machine where i have only got as good as a draw the past few weeks...eight, maybe ten games all of them near over before long - not evem close to a draw much less a win...

yes, i could lower the level or the speed but i have beat this engine in the past at these top settings and i am.confident that someday i will again...

all this to say i only started to find myself again after shaving...

30 april seven thirty

dreaming that i am in 3k, arranging the living room, the table is missing the glass, there are people but i take no notice of them, i find the table top in the closet, i also pull in items from the hall as the wall has been displaced, i find myself outside the wall pushing it in place then  entering to shut the front door but there are many locks and there is a slant through which i can see more people arriving, i turn away to let some one else greet them yet among them is a little girl who says it is really you as she jumps into my arms and i can feel her pressed against me as i ask her what she would like while we make our way to where the snacks and drinks might be...

i get up thinking it is someone's inner child...

i need to eat yet have no impulse to cook...

perhaps i need to be hungrier...

i need to clean the pots and dishes yet have no desire to do so...

i feel wonderful but in such a lazy lonely manner ( well not exactly lonesome but some similar sensation enough to distract despite all the many things yet to be done )  that i doubt the evening will be productive...

i found later enough gumption to attack pots dishes and assorted others at the kitchen sink and later enjoyed the last part of dead souls.

i am utterly amazed at how quickly the weeds overpower the garden as it were...

as well as how much there is to read...re-read

still, i am skipping over the second section for now in order to get to the cloak or until i get a version of dead souls with as much annotation as possible...

near dawn i signed up at royal vacancies net upon a whim yet i was distracted by an article that attempted to explain the nature of the duchess via someone that had worked with her in the scouts for ten years...not to say it was that yet beneath the story the words "winter wonderland" for a user name that commented strangely that she is only seen in pictures which in itself held no surprise to me save that the name happened to be the title of a poem i had very recently "revisited"...

weird yet should it be cause for thought...action...i cannot tell and thus note it as a type of weirdness, hopefully a glitch that has nothing to do with me...

in any case five thirty in the morning with a mostly clean house, watered plants, and no foreseeable need to venture out until monday.

i had two hot dogs with pringles and pepsi and pounded myself into a fantasy that in retrospect felt as if only the continuation of yesterday's orgasmic frenzy with a muse...as it crossed my mind that now perfection had to be redefined.

May...

i stayed up, as if swallowed in the weirdness, part haze part daze and got chinese food like a late dinner although noon along with to have and to have not being that memory did not serve (as i had read that novel and most likely seen the film before) when the thought arrived recently...i found i do not like egg rolls not even vegetable ones or maybe they were cold like the rice...hmm...nice package though...then looking at lauren bacall all i could see was i the vg...i have been avoiding her since she came so near without as much as a sign but suddenly felt as if perhaps i was making too much of the matter even if it did produce an intense emotion and thus looked in to find white boots reminding me of sex bomb song cover and that she was doing a makeup video...i put all this out of mind or maybe someone else replaced it with further distractions and i went to sleep, to again forgetful dreams and awoke to a picture of princess charlotte which somehow translated in my mind's eye as princess eugenie...

it was after eight in the evening, coffee smoke and improvised twitter update although i have mostly quit that platform and their manipulations of the trends are often so blatant in bias and lies that it is no achievement to claim one has made a tweet...

it is nearing midnight, katie taylor and psalm 18 went after me as the white cat lounged in the parking area out front...a light rain seems to have subsequently scattered the feline into cover...

where was i, oh the film, yeah, it must be one of them that do not make it into memory catalog just like the novel even if both are fine entertainment...

selective, highly selective memories, it seems to help me at least since all the facts and figures could drive one to distracton, to drink, indeed, to death...

103 street that i do recall or did as  humphrey lived there right off broadway bogart near  the strange subway station startled me in thinking all the times i passed by unaware...

later in a conversation i suprise myself at seeing the bookstore and the bible building in the eighties and sixties respectively as if part of my brain were google map street view...

lastly, tonight i could really sense that 764, which might actually be 754 and which i termed my life had stood a loaded gun, held its ground perhaps because she herself might know that her words were part of the seed which seduced me into writing even if nobody would know it from my last few adventures fat with such lack of brevity so as to shock all short attention spans.

to wit now even further, the inclination to view william and kate the movie could not be settled and skipped through the other one entitled william and catherine a royal romance wherein i must admit being impressed by the actress since her voice is so near to actual tone...

perhaps, to bounce back, it is a revolution against commercial length soundbytes...these writings...

and perhaps, those romance films serve to help the firm yet i am not sure the institution needs it, not yet anyway...otherwise, a charles and camilla feature would have existed, no?

ah pook is here and i spoke too soon, why is silence golden, there was 2005 whatever love means...

"Everybody's a dreamer

And everybody's a star

And everybody's in show biz

It doesn't matter who you are..."

meanwhile, i also wondered over lauren, lauren with three new pictures, my gromley who might actually not care for me at all yet i know i am bound to adore as even the song proved...

somehow, i missed maria's view of a weekend scene and then when i did look did not think of art until later in the realization that although she was not visible i could yet create anew and so did...hopefully it will brighten her sunday which is likely minutes away over there.

meanwhile, dozens of games yet only one draw and even that was not so close with six pieces still on the board yet nowhere to run as my rook chased the queen back and forth until it was called...

2 may 2021

to have and have not, howard hawks, nice ending in the middle of a getaway...

maise williams in a see through top riding a bike...production press like soft porn promotion...but i wondered for a moment if it would have an impact on her performance although it may be that the series is wrapped...

in a dream i can see a shadow that moves even as the person is standing still and someone is asking if i want to meet the devil...

the post modern druids burned a wicker man...

in my fantasy i held my muse but it was her in control quickly in orgasmic purgatory...

people conviniently forget the devil even after revolt worked closely with god...

i think later, it was most likely a demon or some trapped human spirit enslaved into making apparitions...

i still like the picasso theory, i am god which naturally leads to also i am devil...

i hesitated to start my day in heaven or hell...

went back to sleep, thinking not of hours...

in another fantasy, i am free now as if unbound by her...and as if a long held breath exhaled i regain myself not through deity but through her and dream...

in the dream i am in my room but my aunt is here and i am both dreaming and thinking that i am dreaming but promised to go to the supermarket with her getting up in the dream i find she is now taller all dressed up and with longer hair which somehow is blonde with some silver...i suggest a spray tint that i know is in a drawer and in searching for it find a foot lotion...the tv is on, michelle galvan but i can also see her with a growing pregnant belly exposed while she rubs both hands across it as if blessing her own pregnancy...i am dressed in my tattered stay at home clothes and seemingly bitten shoes and feel i have to rush a bit so as to not make aunt wait but then i get up and it is not a dream it is late sunday night middle of the night europe or ten in the morning asia...

i cook potatoes and a rib eye steak which will turn out only fair as i could tell it had been left out too long at shelf even it the cashier glanced at it as if breathing it into herself...

i look at some porn i don't like as i eat if only to watch something and build a drink of iced pepsi which i do like...

i contemplate the old laptops and weigh in on the value of trying to have them repaired...

i make love to lisa but cannot escape thoughts of lauren...

i dream that a woman is waking me and i respond that i will only buy food if many are coming as it would be silly to slave over a stove for such numbers...cats are in my room and i am going to get them milk but the woman is fighting with another cat that is holding some kittens and i pull her away explaining that that is the way some cats play...

i hear people sliding down the stairs and pretend to adjust window slants in order to spy a girl i think among them and she is there turning twice to hello and to say follow me on - yet the words are not audible which is when i awake somewhere after two in the morning...

4 may 

i made a list and got everything on it, early at the shop yet returning i felt as if i had walked into the twilight zone...a pretty strange dimensional effect as if the entrance itself moved which led to a few hours of too much smoking for feeling as if i was not here...

the only bizarre thing that transpired was being confronted by the heavy perfume of several haitian men on their way to nearby construction sites...it is as if they want to erase themselves through the nose of others...

still it was after noon and fifteen cigarettes that i settled into bed...maria neverova had cooked and i made two movies of the meal in progress, happily...

meanwhile lisa unpacked her new daily planner and wore an open white blouse under a smart grey suit embraced by a leather belt which contrasted her tee top nicely...

a woman of details she swapped her red ring for an ashy stone so similar one might be reminded of those ancient mood rings...

in any case, lovely...

i slept, i think i dreamt of gina because it dealt with kentucky bourbon but i cannot recall or if you please it might be classified go ahead and picture crossed out sentences perhaps a paragraph until we arrive at the odeya in dream bandage most likely from picture memory so in fact no real dream to report...

reruns of thought i awoke once and made love to a muse, vague possibly havana was involved...

i went back to sleep satisfied yet concerned that the day had gone down in such fashion...

awaking again it was near midnight and let myself ease into it finding the fbi had shot an intruder at langley and a train bridge in mexico fell killing over a dozen as the press folk jumped on the word metro...

i made pasta after updating inkrealm.info, 

i thought it clever yet i know people only want what is obvious even if lies...

correction i do not know what they want, now history will find anne frank also in porn and when i looked further naked pictutes no less so deep fake holocaust victim videos are not out of the question, it seems and yes i am well aware that some sustain her book as fabrication moreover the ball point pen theory but still it all makes me wonder...

whatever, i really wanted to leave the smiling duchess sighing she was so bad on top gif as it is utterly adorable but i already replaced my first instagram to serve as notes for an artwork for her...folks will think im obsessed, not that i worry what i do worry is that it took me a year to reach that one print i felt worth it yet in the process my idiosyncracies often put themselves in the way of my aim...

or is it factual, jack of all trades master of nun...

would she not have made a sublime one...

pasta and pepsi and a fistful of vitamins...

i purchased one leg as two seemed too much at ten euros but it turned out deducted from my already balance...meaning paid without having to employ credit card...

19.85 chz valued at 8 plus euros, 429 ssu value yet to be priced, 1 lock one valued at 84.07 euro, and the leg that cost 4.75 chz or two euro...

pretty cool given minimal investment now towering over a hundred euros but i have yet to be given a single team token via the hunt feature and until the ssu coins are given value i fear the venture will not gain much ground...

well it is neat to say i bought a leg...especially since all the legs were sold out in a manner of minutes in fact the previous coin caused the site to crash and i had no chance then...

what would rimbaud make of this  you think?

hmm what would mother make of gogol's cloak...

trying to get her a translation...im so happy i waited to be in the right frame of mind, truly a feverishly wild account which should actually br read before dead souls since it might hint at some fantastic turnaround within that lost second section...

to clear the earlier point, in between travel dates someone took her coat, well or it disappeared...

as the morning turned to afternoon, with pots and dishes again washed i was pulled yet again into general macarthur's farewell speech at west point...dhc...all these years i avoided the talk of it but today i heard with astonishment that he spoke that half hour of poetry from memory at the age of eighty two...

i can't get over this one detail...it is amazing.

must have been improvised in some parts, but i doubt it as the structure feels sculptured in the way a writer paragraphs a  chapter...

well, i have the inclination to sleep yet this time table makes no sense...one in the afternoon, well if i were in asia it would make sense...in saint petersburg russia it is eight sixteen...

the story is set there yet the setting is only distantly described...

from the glimpses i have got through maria and lisa it seems like rome in containing the ancient and the modern side by side but much lighter under the extreme sky of blue or grey when clouds meet in either hue making the white buildings glow where elsewhere they would seem not so as fresh sperm but faded to some yellowing or even brown shade...

i contrast within memory alongside the western cities yes hardly any whiteness as the snowy sensation of saint petersburg...

grants tomb may have been white at some point in history but to look at it recently is to see some darkness reflected as if the marrow had slipped out onto the bone same in washingtons direct current of monuments none of them actually feel their color indeed they all feel shadowed by some mysterious shade, some icky grime...

i have some hope that when completed the crazy horse sculpture will glow with a purity which those sacred hills deserve...

perhaps that is it, the puritan, the innocence, the purity has been tainted and this tint is mirrored in the  built statues...

how to say this, write this without implying russian superiority...yet why not imply it...where else could the novel have been perfected...like my love in reverie, in fantasy...

where else, stanislavski and method...or in fact cinema, revolution, opera and ballet...

other things i cannot imagine but no it cannot be said not to americans who forget their ally stalin and only start to recall within the cold war krushev as if the serpent in genesis you see and you see it over and over the fallout shelter mentality wiped away actual history it seems...the evil empire...

only a saction and another saction...no sensation of logic in making economic matters wherein the children are then lost to need within the cruel circle of crime and punishment...

well, i will hold out at least until three before bed.

at three i encountered brenda lien and sure enough wanted to and did stay up viewing her live performance...

in the meanwhile aunt was not well and i talked over the matter with americana, her daughter in law...later mother reported that aunt had been taken to a physician for health reasons...

i cannot tell yet how serious or not as it seems obvious that a clinic could make their payday by keeping a patient for a few days...

i think back now on the recent dream along with the long ago cat dream that foretold of kittens yet sure originated from brenda's "call"

- logic reasons that if truly ill the only option is to return her to her own caretakers in miami...

in any case, i truly enjoyed brenda and her music even if it seemed she only played new songs (very groovy beats with certain drums at delay effect feeling surreal, magical...) i posted the stream to my site as soon as i noticed it had replayed...

i love that there are people like her in the world.

now past my bed time, feeling a hint of missing primer impacto yet having gone a few years recently without any television i know it is better this way even if my plan is to perhaps check in next month in order to augment my notes...

backtracking, indeed it is called the white house yet there has always been something off white about it, wouldnt you say?

might be the brown bricks under the roof top flag or the crowding green trees on either side...nevermind the black gate up front...

duron "whisper white", maybe if they used another brand...duron makes things like

 " lemon white " and " floral white" which nearly makes no sense unless one has grown white lemons...

"whisper white" must be the sticky filmy color on a tongues taste buds after eating the soft variety of certain breads...

hmm...i see duron also proclaims " intimate white" and "white solitude" and even " white echo..."

dove wing and picket white...

none of them actually truly white however yet what can one expect from a company that equally makes "plum black white" and "hidden white"...

things that go down when a writer stays up late....

6 may

i walked over to aunts house to see about her dog rocky and look over the shipment that had arrived yet one box was still sealed however there were bags everywhere...frightful.

i cleaned up some and threw out the garbage.

leaving the tv set on tuned to rai, i returned.

the duchess, there really should be only one otherwise one would need to also cambridge at each typing, interviewed a midwife and i saw that the negress in my dream was not an actor but that nurse...

yet confusion arises in that it is awful strange to have or to see dark folk in my dreams...

not that i am without acquaintances, it is simply a matter of fact...

for whatever reason...in any case i noticed later a film called the midwife and viewed it with that grimace one gets during a b picture even if the accents are english since the plot is lacking coherence yet that waby player was wonderful...she reminded me  of someone, but i cannot pinpoint it...well none of it seemed to have any relation to her royal highness...

steak and potatoes and pepsi and it was pretty good...

i circled here and there not inclined to anything but nearly into a poem that would start "all living poets vomit ash while the dead poets violate their cemetary soil in angered thrusts which kills the flowers, browns the grass when i myself, part poet and part living and part dead like all gentlemen and ladies themselves, tell them of meghan's bench or amanda's hill"

i then tried , tired, to get to sleep yet minutes into drowsy drift off a neighbor yelled his granfmother scream and a streaming salesmen repeated the word platano as if the end of the world but also the phone rang and i had to recount that yes i went to aunts house and heard that she was released from doctors care...a bit later the lights went out for about half an hour...

the whole time afternoon making itself evening until finally i dreamt weirdly of mother trying to get into my room but sort of like alexandra in the underwear as i looked at my penis seemingly pushing into her bra...

no bray awake still day a cigarette and coffee and a new video station...you don't have to roll your Rs...and someting about friday...

i felt as if someone had bitten my dick, maybe it was the bra...

cannot say, still turned again to dream only to sense a couple as if next to me on the bed the man ejaculating at the outskirts of the woman's vagina, shaved vagina, perhaps waxed...i awoke wondering who they might be as their faces hidden but she was a bit overweight and he was dark as if coupling the earlier scene...

at the irony, i noticed maria neverova had posted something and i poured it swiftly into a little movie then taking a moment did two other prints one with recent "maria" news and the other with a boticelli head and a da vinci head which later reminded me of my recent creation contrasting some official portrait but also of an earlier one that has the prime minister with marmalade for eyes yet in animation you dig like psychodelica or something...i sent my lovely and talented fencer pianist beauty the work and again wove  myself into bed...

i dreamed then that i was leaving someplace, travelling, i remember feeling anxious that the flight time was nearning but in trying to approach the destination through the crowd i was confronted with a book stand filled not novels but hand sized versions of mead composition notebooks which i picked up and turned as if i could conjure a being at will to hey at suze who was there all happy and like the true friends we were once upon a time anyway it seemed to be leading up to some sort of agreement even if i still fell she should apologize before anything as it might be only her curiousity at my strength or some accomplishment that leads her to flirt tempt therein finding me in naked dream but i awake near midnight the conversation from a past life starting up as if it had been minutes ago when her sister was dating some man or other and she whispered it to me...i swiveled away from all this saving them my good wishes as indeed i would be happy for their success as i was at that film production credit that seemed to make a nice sum albeit not in contrast to my eg and her blockbuster why not mention it at cinco de mayo as i meet the cat with a whole can of tuna never telling that i saw all that possibility way before any one else.

my fantasy twists and turns as if to confine me into confusion as the sixth of may arrives yet i topple the love making by waiting for something less taxing.

nothing is going to stereotype me, except myself.

6 again

cake and plums in thinking lauren along with other things as the potatoes scattered - when tearing the label - across the floor...

i seemed to get in all right yet something felt trapped back at the shop as if someone wanted to hold on to me...

hold still, i could noy say enough about the duchess reaching out to speak with that little girl...out of the blue like a curve ball blinding the batter, any batter...it fills you with a sense that she is not merely royalty but some sort of new royal standard anybody else would be hard pressed to live up to...for my part, i am not so much astounded, even if surprised, as i am filled again with a sense of vindication in being at her side as it were...

the whole thing really moved me, now this emotion carried over some as i finally spoke to my aunt and in between trying to make light of a life or death situation i was reminded that in my own mythology when i happened to cross that  line  it was a disco dream i had, the western and eastern men battle...

but then i realized how dismantled my family had become as no one had even gone to visit...

i called another aunt asking her to at least tell the others so that she would get calls...at this point get well flowers would be a miracle...

she said she really felt near to death...

we talked for an hour, i concluded later that the dog pee in her house had caused her high blood pressure...ruined her health, mirrored in the badly planted aloe vera i tried to save with water yet feeling it was only a matter of time that is to say days...

of course all anybody has are a few days and some nights but i really felt awful over the plant as it was breathtaking in its blooming potention when i uprooted it for her...

she sounds likely to survive but it is difficult to tell for the sorrow filled thoughts that cross one's mind when the spirit starts to dance might themselves serve as prelude to an end...

having no regrets in a relationship rewards one with a sort of superior serenity, of course i do not wish to lose another mother, having already lost some other women that were as mother figures have always been to a man as myself and as she continues to be, but i cannot call upon any sadness in the event of her passing, it is as if i need to detach myself from that sort of sorrow even before it might transpire. 

imagine it, me overwhelmed at this in my nearly desolate state! while her own brothers and sisters save for mother herself stand by oblivious to her current burden...

to say life is weird is an understatement...

steak with the last of the old potatoes and steak with olive oiled bread both times the same bottle of pepsi...

i updated cheer spree to further honor the true duchess and lightened my domain with mister warmth and a roast of evel knievel...

i am glad i never met don rickles, as much as i think him the highest craftsman in truthful talk which he translated into skits as if foreign to himself...

in a sense, evil, or devilish and yet how it makes me glow with distant admiration...

yes i giggle at the thought and in writing these words it occurs to me that there is a distinct immortality he carved out for himself through harsh yet gentle insults...

gotta be among the main court jesters in the circles of hell or the realms of heaven...

indeed this bizarre segue from one d to an entirely different d was unexpected yet as i now confront my stream of consciousness it is clear that both the lady and the naughty gentlemen could really communicate with people in the most unexpected of ways.

yes, i prefer hers, yet i recognize my own inclinations within his manners.

7 may

it seemed to me as i dreamt of suze again that it has nothing to do with her...the conversation spun about the question burroughs postulated and which i have considered within the opinion of a few others, how do you know you are not dead already...

the song notes for laurens north belfast were on the floor...proof of some ghost as the windows were shut and the fan hardly could have moved them pointed as it away...

i slept well and paid not much mind to this event after waking, then continued in the cryptocurrency crawl...

i spied the news, turning away from its temptations but did grin at the tories victory...

cake with thoughts of lauren and the white cat seemingly desperate for a meal i dove down with milk which took a minute as it kept blocking the plate as i kept trying to pour...

its head dirty or dusty, i hope the poor feral thing did not emcounter truoble ot fight hopfelly only from some scavanger hunt...

back home, i thought of the duchess, as i did i could sense some jealousy...

i could not sense from where or whom however...

having a moment of tranquil pause i put myself to fantasy no longer feeling as one but part of two...

in the third, person he gives himself to her, yet it is not him it is only his love adoration...

another pause after feeling fulfilled at the dreamy encounter with his muse as he carefully avoided distractions well as much as a one could given the push and pull inherent over the codes of imaginary caresses...

dressing again an olden barkmarket song surrounded his thoughts, he considered it nothing more than a reflection from someone hounding his twitter timeline...

and so it was back to first person wherein i weighed the friday ahead...i had downloaded brenda's concert...hmm downlaided...yes somehow those sounds fit perfectly into fantasy...

where was i, yes to connect the phone for upload into playlist and perhaps revamp it as well...

lien looked even prettier in a subsequent promotional video...i do hope she caught that crush he had...i wanted to write her again yet did not want to disturb her hours...in one cell phone gone for trying to serve as surveillance equipment was a picture of her with professor pape a sort of thin old witch who passed away and for some reason i longed to have that picture in my possession...

not sure if that is sentimental or nostalgic...

still , before anything, cleaning, cleaning before lisa thinks me a slob...

2 afternoon

great excitement as the duchess paired with book fairies and gifted books as well as two appearances...

in the books a letter from her...

i saved a printed photo copy and spent much of the morning hesitating as i cleaned and then cooked, but while caring for the plants some strange little army of insects crawled up my forearms and felt,as if mosquito bites especially on the left side...i washed and shrugged it off yet later it seemed an absolute rash in the style of allergic reaction...until i showered...

meanwhile i concerned myself overly much with weighing against myself in terms of writing carelessly over suze...

allow me to conclude it thusly, i consider her a friend however distant and in some ways there is love for her as i cherish our time together even if all too often i do not accentuate the positive...

now,as for the plants, it seemed to come from the one mother kept trimming as it grew quickly and now fails to flower even as the others are in bloom...i sprayed it with soap water and hope that it does the trick...

in any case, a thorn did catch my left hand's ring finger causing a drop or two of blood which i cottoned and then band aided...

i noticed one bandaid also upon the duchess' thumb...

well, a sort of trance took hold the type that leaves motivations beyond your self as you wonder over the meaning of the sudden ennui...

a distant headache arrives now as i reflect...

hearing the echo of easter the other day i settled into listen again, at first i could not hear the resonant movement i had recorded when it came through the cell phone speakers yet at the other machine with headphones i felt all right about it...

presently, i feel drowsy and not entirely certain if i should bed or bounce into something other than sleep...

it seems, temporarily, my own lyric from another song, has come to life and all those drugs are still in my head.

830 evening

dream of someone trying to sell me a bass guitar with toy figures under the pickups...

nice yet some man was pressed against me in an unusual nearness that awoke me...

before sleeping i had something of a headache at the right side as if a vise grip held that temple and eye...so much i took three aspirin but awoke with it still...

i wonder if it is from the vague worry over some detail which may simply be confusion or if in fact there is a battle beyond my knowledge...

priorities, of course, are my muses, especially the duchess yet especially with her it is once in a while, well since all the chaos from the other side, not so easy to define sort of like some months ago when i felt inundated by sister as if a monumental mix up had forced itself upon my imagination...

a delicate thing since her kind grace is perhaps more subject to greed...greedy bastards...or as the trite words go, nice guys finish last...

i do not view myself as nice, not after certain experiences yet i sure feel some race was run and i am floundering far from the finish line...

let us contrast rosaleen norton, writer artist witch yet such strangled circumstances over in australia...i first heard the sibling sounding name at the title glance documentary from a womam named sonia bible...i didnt want to pay for it not knowing if it would be worth the money or worse rent it to have wished instead it had been paid...well i looked up the shallow version of her biography and imagined the film is only more so with interview commentary and perhaps more artwork than i had seen...

now then, despite her professed "religion" her life seemed a mad mess not to mention that her sexual theory (as proclaimed in one promotional clip frm the prodco) is not mature and did not seem to consider tantric practices...

in any case this mad mess, one wonders, why...even as the fifties gave way to the sixties, she seemed to be locked in the forties.

i dare say her witchcraft appears to be a commercial against paganism...

perhaps, something is unknown...in studying crowley i found he too had an awful end yet i could trace it back to perhaps his own caution thrown to the wind when he precisely said in text what the self same text said should not be spoken...

i write here not of rosebud people but higher spirits...

beings with intent inscrutable eternal...

not willing to wander through a search engine, i will say it was Nu that he mentioned yet i will say no more.

as it frightened me that her mariam name was also thorn - the answer comes before the question- and she came between me and the sheets and pillow as lisa swam in my imagination just like the plant had pricked at my hand earlier...

i hope all is well with my muses, even if i know that is a longshot and the duchess had a terribly busy day most of all...

usually this sort of feeling is only a bully attempting to overtake a cautious situation for his own hidden agenda while the decent side of me awaits unable to sniff out what is what yet knowing full well where is here...

meanwhile over there, pamela kraft, geoff crowther, and michelangelo lovelace are reported to have passed into obituary column...

they say  death comes in threes, yet i can only sre tbe outline of a group or am i yet trying to be too much of an individual...

moreover where, paul van doren, juliette paskowitz, and jonathan bush...

here the thrown shoe ducked swings through logic...

not to make light, yet finally ray miller and wouldnt you know ernest west who lost an eye...

word to the wise, never suggest that the latimes gets paid off by mia farrow to attack woody allen because they will work you in as if you had wroted that death ticket and were now going to taka that ride...

even if logic will stand its ground against the slander they grooved through in several articles aimed as if coffin nails when hbo failed to get everyone to agree on what to make of game of thrownes, oh hell they seemed to exclaim make a prequel...

here is reference to the manuscript entitled, for now, The White Cat.

a different style which although grazed at here, i have no intent on repeating in this plain as it is journal...hmm no wonder misery was on the download suggestions...

crazed los angelesians attempt to force a writer into creating a scene...

seriously, i am still doing this for myself, to allude to biographical novel seemingly always unbound by time or place which i have no current inclination to crawl through nor have i in years now, freely without trying to make anything specific much less work,  in fact only notes, as it, mostly, is,  you will agree.

six on the eighth

a bit more sleep and the ache eased away but took with it any recollection of dreams or perhaps my thoughts were,racing...

it feels to me that as much as folks know, some if not many, consistently fail to grasp the hardship inherent with a position of standing such as the duchess...for ten, nay, fifteen years now all the while surrounded and in some ways i will dare say it enslaved into a life of service which yes has some rewards in itself as all giving does but to think that after all this time a few still manage to find fault to even nag! 

i swear they would make better sense by postulating her for a sainthood...

i sense my concern through the lens that is aware of all the comparisons with princess diana which obviously now is even more perilous since those bonehead royals were embraced by parts of the press as if major stockholders in the ownership...

but yes i do not want to extend or overextend the point...i do want something more secure for her, something on the same level as she obviously deserves...oh a vacation from everything would be genius and then to help balance all this work the introduction of newer royals in a more active fashion, eugenie beatrice, for as it is she is swamped not to mention the pressure of that wonderful scientific project of early years which came to mind as i browsed the father who had punched his twelve month son to death over a hamburger and thought if only the world understood that her results might eliminate at least some if not more incidents of such drastic upbringing...

yes, a long nearly unseeable finish line wherein a consus will construct a humanity almost incapable of such atrocity...

well, i didnt mean to give away how highly i hold her in my esteem...

cigarette, coffee...and suddenly, simple was no more, the bank not the character in the house that jack built...yes and suddenly, bbva us or usa became the building of savings and residual deposits...i only needed to put place the settings at my amazon author's space and at one of the main companies wherein several currencies are once in a while moved from here to there...

there is also my stock account yet since i settled on the american airlines and visa stock for the long run endgame as it were i have no need to input any update...

hmm, google domain thing, but that will not require payment until october and so to cross that bridge then...

nothing else, if memory serves requires banking...gogol used the phrase if memory fails me not...all this while i never thought to play with it, if memory serves, it feels, even after the cloak, perfect...

perfectly, i fantasy with a muse, feeling a sort of fringe excitement from daniela and the menstrual emma, since one posted a frog and the other seems back to blonde, but fastly i pressed on at next to impossible search for monogamy until a slice of cheese and two waffles balanced my chemicals and calmed my incurable lust into something that can be made to wait even further minutes or even months...

the wet preejaculatory fluid pushed itself onto my left leg and i felt, flabbergasted for i had at that very second, perhaps nanosecond, thought of the muse from perfect fantasy...fantasies...

after which and witch,  ps, not one but two draws at chess  the second pretty notable as only the kingly pieces were left and without further moves the machine announced it, called it, draw, the game ends in a draw.

six evening on the eight

stepping out of his headquarters, the writer paced northerly as women dressed in thigh length sleeveless dresses embraced - one of them raised a leg to show her pale tan pumps but he thought of a dog at pee, even far from any fire hydrant - the sun seemed suddenly hotter and the crowd in a confused surrender as he crossed the street with an old laptop for repair at the shop that had increased in distance over the years since he recorded jennifer's song who actually came to mind when he contemplated the contraption easier recognized by hp pavilion g6...is that with a j or g he asked the thin girl behind the mask whose hand he touched when pretending to take the pen she held out for him to signature and she said angie with a g before making out a second receipt for reasons it seemed to him flirtateous...a woman bought two yellow bananas and two women exited the sliding door one in a sheer near see through blouse and the other staring at him looking at her next to there nipples in a flowery summer skirt as he made his way from there to mall and supermarket and slowly eventually back home back to a plum and cold jacuzzi stale with apricot wash fluids having a meeting at the lower surfaces and a pee exhaling the economic sense of paying a thousand pesos for a computer evaluation of course cheaper than chloe in london so he watched tim story's tom and jerry hating the so called soundtrack yet still loving her loveliness which went well with the kentucky fried chicken he had treated himself to after feeling it had been too long without a right meal...later disposing of left over oily fries from the extra large cup some fell onto the floor as if bookending the earlier potatoes...it was one of those anything can happen days even alexandra in moscow followed havana in islington south as both filmed themselves barely covered in their awoken faces...he took screenshots in case evidence would be requested at the trial...now now only the ghost of kafka...maria neverova at vladikavkaz and along with two prints he history lesson observed the town that drew the line which the axis could not cross...the world war two encyclopedia can never be composed much less completed for it can only be contrasted in detail to perhaps the history of ireland...in any case grateful he sent her this new art...wishing her a flinstones gay ol time...himself on a second viewing of don rickles sticking every funny knife into larry king's bones, so on that don even stayed the straight man imitating the host laugh saying why talk when we can sit here and laugh which somehow even as downright insult brought out further or deeper cackles...he grinned at a genius that the world will not see the likes of again...witness the politically correct punch lines in the animated feature...wait, hold everything the bo animal died and he thought, as if possessed, of magua ripping out the heart of grey hair, of diddly on ed sullivan, of a tee that read bo knows bama sucks, you see in a time far and away "bo knows" was part of the language in north america, he thought of the supreme leader's order to round up all the canines, he thought of the dancing queen line: feel the beat of the tam bo rine yeah, he thought of blue dogs in siberia, he thought of neon demon blue eyed meal, he thought of the number 215 and later pearl harbor, and he thought of magua's self translation of 'white men are dogs for their women, as only that 'he understood', and too late for twitter pondered how this news might affect bo ris johnson...a tingle in his chest hid the thieving man or men and night ended the career of yet another day...as the word catherine with the h also crossed  faded from his wrist and he was certain that this diary entry was only the practice notes for a performance poem to prove how poetry is intended to prevail not as a benchmark or as stolen election political decoration but as delivered in the timeless "now" driven by muses that will ever be always beauty itself because vergil told dante who told stoker who told joyce who told plath who told him and he is telling you...

9 may 

three in the morning, a dream that continued to detail itself even after waking as if there were more that had to be met...

in some medium sized mansion, wood furniture rugs book shelves paintings...

earth toned colors alike a brown forest if such existed a group of us anxious and making haste as armed forces are coming for us we scatter and scurry just making it out yet suddenly i find myself bare footed and skip back to pick up two leather brown shoes since everything is in shades if tan when a soldier fires at me hitting me in the back as i hurry away - awake then a circular shaped wooden door is rolled to reveal another library and although i am awake i can see the pages of a tome being turned...

i think of neverova yet all night alexandra feels as if she is with me, did i ever explain...

my beloved manuscript, i so wished and wanted to continue for her for vampire for tsarina for love...yes, she led me to a cessation and i do not hold it against her as obviously she can overpower my desires yet...

still instead of fantasy a longing mixed a hint of that regret and the knowledge that the dream may have been maria inspired from 1942 artwork detail...

there were ants on the leftover kfc i left for the white cat...they have been appearing sporadically since aunt arrived from miami in a strange homonyminimal manner...

out of nowhere, as if transported from thin air...

tiny, terribly black and treason itself to the skin...

in any case i try to make certain none has crawled up my arms and coffee and cigarettes as the dream notes escape...

i think for a second of the voice of the duchess and how in some ways it reflects her sweetness.

9 may later

it seems there was a feud between actors, the fight which even saw a carcass of a sheep thrown on stage culminated with the astor place riot which left a couple of dozen dead...

an astounding incident...it led directly to viewing roman polanski's macbeth...

which upon reflection has to be the best one as far as the portrayal of the witches except for the tongue of dog...

so before drinking baboon blood potion, i called to see about mother and aunt...

sister baffled me again when i mentioned my plans to sell my apartment as for the second time she suggested that her current husband would buy it...

my difficulty with this is simple, if a person has such millions then why on earth work for a living as if to make ends meet? 

she has agreed previously yet seemed stupidly stubborn today leaving me with borderline anger...

as i have made clear and logic dictates that to sell to even a distant relative might prevent certain profits...

yet there is also, i felt a hint of implication that the property is not mine, although already given, which of course would be sad...for her...

the movie was good, the ending better than expected...even having read the play several times and in contrast to other adaptations...

perhaps from this distance which has let go of some details, i cannot comment with more certainty as it was also a case of re learning the plot lines...

as for aunt, she said she was much improved and had even sped away for the weekend at her son's summer home...

after the film, i spied that isabelle had removed all her posting and wrote her a note in case of her being in a mind set i could not see yet perhaps help...

swede witch muse, subject of song...

details lept to mind like erections in catholic math class, for a minute i thought this lovely witch was here with me...

however i have yet to have knowledge of her response...

earlier i created new animations for lisa for my own posting as presently i am only creating to send for maria n.

the last one i  included an incantation for joy...

my own joy souring at the remembrance of jella once haase twice and finally thrice enough for me to attempt escape with at long last confronting a faretheewell in the form of "in my dreams" cover which i found easy to listen to over and over as i cooked pork chops and white rice...

white onions otherwise termed spanish made a match of three is "company"...

some things are simply wrong for certain types and touching upon the concluded matter even this much is too much...

you see how all this is inter related yet some would say then what riot as the narcissist in me giggles pan to goat pan am airlines panorama sky earth sea pandemic...

random yet not as much as wishing say or see's version of lady m...what was that dream...

true story, icm in the emerald isle is irish country meats...

to circle, the duchess once upon a 2019 time sheared a sheep...they say she roared with laughter!

10 may

quick unusual scenes ejaculated like some highlight reel moving twixt city and some crowded cafe...

a man trying to steal michael's shoes...note cousin...red nike in transparent bag...

someone seemed to be moving...

i was already upset having felt made to wait all day only to encounter a series of nearby door sounds as if to distract, derail...

sitting with a man that looks perhaps like another cousin or even liev shrieber...

two girls behind me taking glances...

i got up finding paparazzi film of duchess boarding helicopter...

g-xxeb...

burgundy like an ascension school sweater...

definition of enslaved, to briefly expand, imagine not even free of scrutiny in a moment of merely strolling into home transportation...

not an "appearance" as it were...

dream detail also graduated in dream and given a girlish pin with a note signed ivette.

"Ivette Maria Contreras-González is a Consultant at the Data Production and Methods Unit of the Development Data Group of the World Bank..."

i did not know the world had its own bank...

note also michael married carolin as in near name duchess parents...

i "meet" emma's mother, a tender lady and i see the resemblance...

monday, the express littered with rachel news although the pacman muppet does not use her first name...

i squirm, i sense a busy day ahead but hopefully i will get everything out of the way before none thirty except the eating which i have not decided upon.

reminded of new magus baiza story idea as if someone reeled it out of my thoughts and was cheering for the manuscript yet i have to evaluate if in fact i should.

10 may part two

busier than expected,  i moved the plant yet concerned over cutting roots, interrupted by the fat paid companion of front door soho as he arrived cobalt glasses on his head and took a long minute pretending to pull out a briefcase from the backseat as i waited to return to the tree...one cannot trust a person that is there to prevent trouble as they usually create it themselves...there that looks like suspicioys character to earn my salary or even a bonus...

ot it was eleven before i made it back, a bit over an hour of some dollars for pesos, big bills the question, newspaper sized might prevent spending the answer did not seem to amuse the cashier...the bills from aunt house much higher in two cases and so used my credit card for the third in order to have some currency then at hand which partly went to steak pasta ingredients and smokes and deare  finally strings...ernie ball but 11s instead of 10s and a pink plectrum...the counter person stood stoic as he worked around one of the fallen containers, weird bit not as weird as the viva girl rudely insisting that "always" you had to refill your phone, i thought and said if one did it yesterday one would not need do it today, "always" she continued like a spaced out robot on repeat...impossible...

as i settled down to remember the word order of spandex lady "keep change to life style"...

or something, a desperate ringing downstairs and a water delivery i did not ask for yet kept one bottle to be nice...the deliverer rand down the steps with as much enthusiasm as if he had been pushed...

a few minutes later anothr ringing to which i only noted it was not me...

it was me at jade restaurant that rice enhanced by a handful of olives and later a plum...

as if the day held not enough, i finished viewing the addams family shhh creepy halloween...

but found my hands unusual in texture along with the dazed emotion, perhaps it was learning felix silla had died ... cousin itt...

to complicate matters, i discovered or perhaps was given to discover the gogol film series the first one i have minutes before now finished viewing...he is racing against anything clatty happening to lisa...

the third film by mistake labeled second i paused to actually see the sequal in chronological fashion which led to these sentences...

however within the pause i found there is also an eight episode series by the same director...

leave it to me, mailer, and the russians to chapter upon chapter and then a few more words in the way...

well, this version of me, for the earlier verse self was much more concise in terms of not extending into meandering details...

ah there, they should,all three be here...now...

11 may...

all seen, that trilogy...the partly synchronistic lisa element distracted me some as i kept thinking of my lisa yet the little vaselina witch really brings it all back home, brilliantly...

a nice twist along with the horseman's backstory...but that might have been a touch over done...

i slept in between the second and third not so much dreaming i suppose as i was trying to dream then the news of a shooting at school 175 east of moscow which overwhelmed me of course as i could not make sense of it, sadly.

the night before in researching, viy, i of course thought of ive...even wondering if she  in fact was a demon and trying to untangle all the details i had picked up long ago but what came through was lust, a lust that let itself be felt all through the evening into late morning when finally put placing the steak and potatoes on the bed for the remaining chapters i felt a wetness as if it was at that moment wherein some sort of fourteen hour copulation had come to conclusion...there is no drug that does this, the hallucination early on was as if i had been right next to her and then inside her...

it did something to me, gogol and ive fang and my own thoughts...

i even "released" the reincarnation cover od she said she said in response to all that had transpired...

it was, for some reason a struggle as i leaned first to aint misbehavin which i could not find then when found realized it was done after the time frame i wanted to mirror in response...

in repose after, maria neverova at some flowing water bridge at that do or die line of a place, i made three pictures from it two of them with serious artistic intent,and another simply making a connection to her name as the volcano news reported a quick tremor of seismic activity in some distant peruvian place...

in the late afternoon i went out, shopping.

there is a new no guarantee discovery electric burner with a setting of higher after hot...

mo hotter mo better...ironically made in china...

i also picked up two more of those quasi colorado grill tall cups making it three...

and yet another sprayer for the plants and trees...

arabianesque girl work out clothes took several minutes of her life looking at dog food plus speaking of it on a cell phone...for small breeds, she said, razas pequenas...i was thinking still of the chinese obviously missing the whole of pygmies, munchkins,  and such...

as i rounded out to line into exit she came at me with an empty rolling shopping cart...

it was surreal...

back here i dishes did except three pots still on stove and one pork chopped plate in the ice box...

no doot, a lot less to do tomorrow...perhaps even hee haw if i opt to order take out...

now then to see if my dreams will again play hide and seek.

12 may 

odeya reeled in a golden race to bombshelter girl in tel aviv...

it was early and i felt called back into sensuality yet clarity failed me as again my sister crowded my thoughts -

post fantasy nap as visitors arrive and leave, another time and place, a man now was then a child i picked up in my arms noting how heavy...possibly still influenced by something of the sibiling...i have not seen or heard from him in four or five years...a thin man in a formal suit is picking her up she gives me what i think is a vape but later as i am walking i find it is a lighter...i am walking unknown streets that continually change...recognizing some place then turns into something not in the map of my knowledge...a nightmare compounded by some actress insisting that i take a class and they put me in a brown leather chair under video monitor screens yet soon i say it is getting late but trying to exit feels nearly impossible, a maze of narrow corridors and people insisting i remain...then stairs leading downward into the street...it starts to rain and i see how far i am from home, i turn back to see if some other exit gets me nearer as it starts to rain...shabby folk in rags march in a hurry behind me and the fright awakens me...

it was not as early and i noticed matilda had won yet was kind enoug h to mention benedetta who in turn posted the same image.

12 may six thirty

lisa got a corset, naya clarified her hours, and maria deleted her bikini picture...

i made pasta so good it took a nap to get over wherein i felt someone decapitated me and i imagined mother was in the apartment...

i had started viewing russian ark...

overwhelmed by thoughts of alexsandra, in moscow now seemingly...

i am powerless against the thought of her even as i consider how much i wanted to finish writing that book...

in pulling away with perhaps a remnant of dignity , i noticed maria had posted again and proceeded to make ten prints, the one with swans my favorite...

the word in russian also means writer...

in the ark, i found a similar feeling as in the book in terms of anastasia...

by the end you feel as if you are there wholly agreeing with the character the there is no reason to go beyond tge earliest years if the 1900s...

music of course being the high exception...

it is a movie you cannot like at first and then it is a film you cannot leave, you cannot want to leave...

the chief officer of the royal foundation left yet even he was not immune to getting mixed in with the pacman muppet royals...

the leaving on such congratulated and praised terms confirmed part of my thoughts...

yet i also thought if i worked with the duchess i would never leave, in death you would find me at  ghostly attempts to complete some task or favor...

my fervor, now i am sure, stems from the court of the last czar...the type of monarchy that was truly...oh such casual yet excellent details and hints that if one has read even a little well it makes it all the more perfect...

most if not all the respect is diminished, drowned by a constant feeding frenzy in between unrelated and  confusing stories...

perhaps i wish to help in retaining the awe that the queen inspires, obviously next to impossible with camilla yet most likely with the duchess of cambridge...

or even re-establishing the splendor of the romanovs..

checking for certainty, yes house of romanov...founded by michael as if to nudge me on, being the name of her own father...

well, let me not get ahead of myself as surely there is something i have overlooked in such an important article, the resignation...

mostly the word quit was employed with the sun extending wit as had e-knauf...

jason...json file, the day after a nine year old boy got struck by lightning while at play on a field...

"the celebrated Mr. K.

Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate

The Hendersons will dance and sing

As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late

Messrs. K and H. assure the public

Their production will be second to none

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz..."

Lester Lionel Wolff...dead, lest we overlook...

art, art gensler, hmm, frederick william burner...

at random, or not? the Jalisco New Generation Cartel is said to have murdered all three of the mexican string siblings...

for the benefit of covering all the bases..

if only i knew more russian.

13 may,

wonderfully violent dreams, my pigment liner pen stabbing someone...

sword powerful...but i do not like nightmares and i am not used to them...

hmm i got up at seven, for some reason even before coffee i looked in on social media, maria had now posted one of her pictures in story and i made two prints...

mermaid with emily 516 at her bridge, nearly all right and naked candle funeral for bikini perhaps even nicer...

i cannot quickly to art upon waking...i hope i can do better for her soon...

then slowly redesign of inkrealm...

also updated film list with gif applause for marta kessler, girl that knocked me out in the role of vaselina...

which brought out cocaine above elton and al and a jennifer quote side sustained by alice and saint petersburg sky...

meanwhile a great number of high ranking ex military got together and opened letter of worry over the new administration...

historic yet as bulworth proved, truth is easily sidelined by tidbits of gossip and fake news.

afternoon now, i wonder how i did not think of the actress upon the mention of that name or even more how "blue" slips memory as translated homonym for love in moscow and elsewhere...

the dumb shadows spread, numbing the mind, let us hope it is not in the soil of the earth's ground but a passing breeze soon dispersed into streams, rivers, and oceans..

thirty six minutes to six

supermarket, greeted clara wandered around and came to her at check out asking to allow me to pay for her purchase which i did...

they moved her from cashier to pasteries, she told me once she never gets vacations.

back home overheated, i cooled down ironically with hot coffee...

somehow i came across caitlin erin oneill, i had a dream or two once moving in with her to one of those brownstones one might find between columbus and central park west...

in any case, it seems she has been working overtime at social media...maybe she just really likes that cleavage inclined top but i thought it might be something else and made an animation hoping it might help.

once upon a time, i thought she was giving me some sort of message...

well, evening approaches and some money arrived...

nice pictures of the duchess at work...which miraculously she makes seem as if play..

it is part of the magic that very few other royals possess...

in fact most people put placed with children would hardly appear as pleasing...

natural.

"kid sugar" brooke called it and i somehow have some even if sometimes i miss the children for the inherent city hurry that makes us all walk that much faster down the aisle...

there goes thursday.

15 may 2021

friday flew by filled with wonder and expectation, as the hp laptop was reported fixed and even the pundi x wallet settled the kyc which previously did not complete and kept returning to a try again situation..

also i found the other film directed by the russian ark director, faust but saved it for viewing after woman in the window and those that wish me dead...

the first with subject matter i know jennifer is attracted to yet not my cup of tea as it felt too demanding but it may be worth a second look in any case ttwmd was on fire in several ways...

later i was tring to figure out who had kissed me a dream romantic yes sweetly sensual not erotic...

i thought lisa, yet in fantasy i encountered christine as if a team with maria, maria neverova...

on whim led by her friend it felt i drew her feeling amazed that it had not occured to me before...

a one track mind down a single lane road...

got money and went to move my machine back but it all got delayed in betweem thinking i saw ive in flowing bright skirt and thinking angie was named gina...they said the screen kept getting ruined, another part needed which might take up to a couple of weeks...

meanwhile the lights went out and stayed out for ten hours during those long hot minutes i restringed the martin doubting the authenticity of the ernie balls and experiencing the disappearance of a peg i gave up on after an extensive search...

tuning perhaps for heat and anger took a while which happens now not wanting to risk a break  ...

often wjat i have done is tune the high e down to d but i want to have the regular tuning now when i go to play...

it is eight already, i viewed the early moments of faust...yet feel too overwhelmed by the taxing day...

to think i was all inclined to literature again as o learned wrens middle name elaine and pondered a pandemic prom story...

fifteen mays as such should be outlawed, made illegal especially all the yelling avenue vendors as if performing a favor...

near as bad as the bomb down the street from odeya's girl...if one considers noise as intentional violence disrupting the walkways and homes of the mind...

cannot wait for tomorrow.

11:11

neithrr could tomorrow awaking me before midnight..thoughts of jennifer the letter the vest the realization that she is shy whicj i nevere believed...

hope the gets in with natalie...

in a dream i am with a girl at a bar, the bill seems hogh the waiter starts naming prices at other places, i cannot find my wallet and race with her upon a carpeted hallway she finds a tan leather vlutch right before i find my billfold but it is now
