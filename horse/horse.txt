## Chapter 1: The Naked Highway (Version one)
<pre>
The phone rang although it was nothing
like a phone anymore... There was no
cord or anything reaching into the
wall, into wires that would meet
other wires and sizzle with a soft
electric vibration... This phone was
a flat mechanism which felt hot
after holding a conversation for
a few minutes...



The heat didnt have time to take
hold.  Put mom on the phone, Ian
asked.  He asked five times before
he understood...

Mom was never
coming to the phone... She is
outside gardening, she went for
a walk, she left in the other car,
she is sleeping... The fact was
even if she came to the phone, it
would not be her.

It would only be
what remained after the ravages of
old age destroyed what she had been,
what he knew as mom... He did not
feel - perhaps-  as he should or
as others might, since the chaos
within this logic could not be
calculated within his mind.

When he finally did speak to her,
he understood further...

It had
to be selfishness.  It was for his
sake - the talk.  He wanted, like
any momma's boy, his mother.

Sure,
he argued within that it eased her
as it brought back memories or
even details that pleased her...
But he could not hide the truth
from himself, nothing could help
her - indeed, nothing could bring
her to the phone.

Around the same time, perhaps even
in that same moment, no pun intended,
he had met Wilhemina.

She was thin,
tall, seemingly frail yet exceptionally
strong except when strumming a guitar
which somehow made her appear short
and clumsy... The farm whispered in
green and several shades of colors
he had not seen in the city.

He felt instant love, a knowing so
powerful that it nearly made him
tremble - but it wasn't her, it
was Evlyn that flashed before his
eyes as he gazed upon this beautiful
blonde woman that talked all night
about horses and sat down playing
g major and a minor chords into the
wild horses verse  which
she mumbled through like a method
actor more concerned with her fingering
- especially at the barre chord in the
chorus...



Evlyn didn't play guitar but that
didn't matter... she was gone and his
mother was never coming to the phone
again and he could not feel love
without Evlyn.

He excused himself.

Bathroom.  Fentanyl.
He was happy again until he found himself
crawling in the middle of the highway
naked, struggling to reach his Ralph
Lauren blue pinstripe two piece suit -
A car hit a motorcycle as he slipped
into his pants.

The dividing line
disappeared and he worried that vehicles
from the other side of the accident
would run him over.  Then, he weighed,
I am already trampled under the burden
of being an American in a country
that gave itself away for foreign
policy, for the police state.  The blazer
felt sharp as it covered his shoulders...


I am already devastated by not having
a true soul to speak with and even when
I find a true soul all I can think of
is her...

The sky was darkening.  He got up,
shirtless and shoeless not even realizing
his mom had been the shirt and Evlyn
had been the shoes.
